1,"NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP's) stance against FDI in retail has come in for criticism by one of its recent high-profile entrants from the world of business. GR Gopinath or Captain Gopinath, the pioneer of low-cost aviation in India, who joined AAP in Bangalore on January 4, on Wednesday publicly disagreed with its decision to disallow majority foreign-owned supermarket groups from operating in Delhi, and warned that the party ran the danger of being ""branded like other political parties of resorting to cheap and populist measures"". Gopinath said the AAP-led government's decision to reverse its predecessor's permission for FDI in multi-brand retail would send a wrong message to investors that India is an unstable country with regard to economic policies. ""AAP is unwittingly also playing into the hands Indian oligopolies who were opposing FDI in retail so that they could have a monopoly... Which means it is okay for Indian corporates to rape India and not foreign retail. That's exactly what 'crony capitalism' is,"" he said. Gopinath, a former army captain-turned entrepreneur, said he personally believed allowing FDI in multi-brand retail, a September 2012 decision of the UPA government that became a litmus test of India's ability to undertake reforms, was a good idea and the opposition to it was from ""the old BJP lobby of small traders"". ""Opening up is good for the farmers and also the economy and the country. The view of small retailers is unfounded... No retail corporation can shake our Udupi hotels or mom-and-pop groceries. Even in the West, the corner store thrives. No Pizza Hut has dislodged Italian eateries,"" he said. ""AAP must step back and deliberate and not do anything in haste in terms of policy decisions."" AAP, which became a political sensation after it trounced the Congress in Delhi elections, has seen a steady stream of high-profile names sign up to become its members. Apart from Gopinath, former banker Meera Sanyal and former Infosys board member V Balakrishnan have joined the party.",GR Gopinath slams AAP's stand on FDI in retail - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/gr-gopinath-slams-aaps-stand-on-fdi-in-retail/articleshow/28860766.cms
2,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. Itís never too early for news TV to begin searching for the next prime minister. The next general elections are still three months away but TV news behaves as if theyíre being held tomorrow. Itís a case of back to the future, and the future is now. Thus, Times Now conducts live national debates on the weekend about issues for the elections and before the electorate. Watched Sitaram Yechury (CPM), Anand Sharma (Congress) and the BJPís Piyush Goel exchange barbs and accusations on your corruption versus mine, Sunday. Thus, CNN-IBN, Tuesday, began a new early evening show, A Billion Votes óBattle for 2014. It deemed the initiative worthy of Rajdeep Sardesaiís presence along with late evening studio regulars like Vinod Mehta, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Tavleen Singh. Subject? Rahul Gandhi as ìPM nominee ó too late or a gamechanger?î And thus, writer Chetan Bhagat has decided that ìDecision 2014î is important enough to require his services as an anchor of a new news feature, 7 Race Course Road (ABP). Thatís the most famous address in the NCR after Kaushambi, Ghaziabad where Arvind Kejriwal resides. The former is, of course, where Manmohan Singh is spending his last few months as Indiaís prime minister. The show is about those who may succeed him at the PMís official residence. And the first among equal aspirants is Gujaratís roving chief minister. Following the successful format of Pradhan Mantri, 7 Race Course Road mixed dramatic reconstructions with interviews, available visual and factual material on the BJPís PM candidate. We see a young Narendra Modi arrive in Ahmedabad, his sojourn at the tea stall, his shift to Sangh service and then to Gujarat student politics. It is a fascinating story and you can see why Bhagat wanted to host it. His debut is as youíd expect it to be: heís hesitant, needing to grow into the role and sound authoritative on the subject. Away from the world of politics, Chivas Studio Gentlemanís Code (Star World) promises, in the words of its host, writer Aatish Taseer, to take a long ìhard lookî at men. After the first episode, youíre left wondering if it didnít employ a soft touch. Imaginative in conceptualisation with segments alternating between black/ white and colour, unusual camera angles, readings interspersed with interviews and conversations, it looked at men in relation to women (mothers, changing women, whatever that means,), men and sex, without being revelatory. So while itís interesting to listen to Karan Johar on living with his mother, not getting married and his motherís wishing ìhe was a small boy againîwhen she ìowned himî, whatís new about the all-Indian mamaís boy? Or Chetan Bhagat (yes this is his week on TV) reading from his book and telling us men cannot accept that a woman theyíre involved with had sex with another man? Or about the two men who frequent an informal singles club and think that concepts like ìlove at first sightî are unrealistic? Or that men suffer from anxiety about sexual performance, that itís more for ìprocreation than recreationî in the words of a doctor ó most women could tell you that. And when Taseer and Priyanka Chopra claim to like item numbers, well, how could it be otherwise for Chopra, who appears in them? Gentlemanís Code is cleverly packaged, but hard-hitting? Letís wait for the next episode. A bit of this and that now: Salman Khan appeared on TV by Modiís side but said let the best man be PM; he also sang on Nach Baliye (Star Plus), as unusual an occurrence. His father, Salim Khan, sat beside Javed Akhtar and blamed himself for the professional scriptwriting break-up with Akhtar (CNN-IBN). Akhtarís son Farhan won the hamper on Koffee with Karan (Star World), much to the disgust of fellow guest Vidya Balan in the most enjoyable and entertaining episode of the more ìspicy, steamy seasonî, as Johar calls it. By the way, why the obsession with sexual innuendo and homosexuality in every episode? And thank you DD National for telecasting on Sunday Ishqiya, just after Dedh Ishqiya was released. The latterís star, Madhuri Dixit, appeared in the Front Row (Star World) not in a demure but tantalising saree that hid as many secrets as it revealed, but in a fitting black dress.

Just when you thought that you were broadening out and setting off for new lands, you will have to return to the realm of routine details and mundane trivia. However, you must realise that it is essential to build your future on firm foundations. CAPRICORN DEC 23-JAN 20. You are not fond of unnecessary change, but the moment seems to have arrived when you can no longer remain rooted in former times or refuse an opportunity to move to more hospitable surroundings. What you really need at the moment is security ñ but, by building for the future, not recreating the past. CANCER JUNE 22-JULY 23. Itís a profound moment in many ways. You are in the middle of an ongoing process of personal re-evaluation that is affecting both your practical and personal concerns. It is always useful to question your own motives, and this time youíll discover a whole new dimension to your feelings. LEO JULY 24-AUG 23. Please give others fair warning that you have had enough of delaying tactics. However, for as long as Mercury, planet of communication, is being obstructive, you must be both patient and flexible. Thatís because partners will take some time to realise that you are right. VIRGO AUG 24-SEPT 23. There are another two weeks before Mercury is again in a position to shed some light on your financial affairs. Until then you should just continue to act casually ñ as if nothing has changed. Plus, thereís no reason why you should deal with problems which other people have ignored. AQUARIUS JAN 21-FEB 19.

Bear this advice in mind especially at work, because other people will not thank you for puncturing their dreams. Try giving them some support instead. PISCES FEB 20-MAR 20.

You know that your ambitions now involve a certain amount of increased expenditure. Aries MAR 21-APR 20. The Moon is adopting a rather businesslike attitude today, ideal for you to put burning issues to one side and get on with routine tasks. Remember that partners are still going through a rather touchy phase, and that they do need all your sympathy and support. SCORPIO OCT 24-NOV 22. Partners may be irritating you, but you are in no position to make a song and dance over personal slights or hurts. You have offended other people in the past, even unintentionally, and should therefore be tolerant of their little foibles in the present. LIBRA SEPT 24-OCT 23.

Stocks were lower in afternoon trading, with the S&P 500 pulling back from the record highs reached Wednesday. The Dow and Nasdaq declined slightly. CNNMoney's Tech 30 index was also lower. Best Buy ( BBY , Fortune 500 ) was the biggest loser in the S&P 500, with shares tumbling almost 30%. Investors were disappointed after the retailer reported a drop in holiday sales . Best Buy shares more than tripled in 2013, as investors bet on a turnaround at the company. Some traders on StockTwits wondered what the poor results could mean for Best Buy's future, given that the holiday shopping season is typically the strongest period all year for retailers. But abebut pointed out that a pullback may be healthy for Best Buy's stock, following its massive run-up, adding that Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) shares have done the same.

5,"Related. 2008 Batla House encounter convict Shahzad Ahmed was on Thursday denied bail by the Delhi High Court, which also admitted his appeal against his conviction and life sentence in the case. A bench of justices P K Bhasin and J R Midha dismissed the bail plea of Shahzad, 25, who was awarded life term on July 30, 2013. He was convicted and sentenced for killing decorated police officer Inspector M C Sharma and injuring two other cops in the September 19, 2008 encounter when a team of Delhi Police Special Cell raided the Batla House flat in Jamia Nagar on a tip-off that terrorists involved in the September 13, 2008 serial blasts in the city were holed up there.

6,"Related. A three-judge bench headed by Justice R M Lodha, which had agreed to look into the alleged irregularities in coal block allocation on September 14, 2012, wrapped up the proceedings which witnessed the Centre itself putting in motion the process of de-allocating some coal blocks. The bench heard the arguments of all concerned parties involved in the allocation, including the seven mining states and the association of mining companies. Private companies contended any order of the apex court should have prospective effect and all the allocations should not be scrapped in one go and it should be decided on a case-to-case basis. ìIt is submitted that as far as the system of allocation is concerned, any challenge, even if successful, could have prospective effect where people have acted in a bona fide manner, assuming the machinery was in accordance with law. If there are irregularities in the grant, it is submitted that it would depend on the facts of an individual case as to the degree of the irregularities and whether it has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, in which case there could be a wholesale invalidation,î senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for associations of Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association, said. The court was hearing petitions filed by members of civil societies including former CEC N Gopalaswami, ex-Navy chief L Ramdas and former Cabinet Secretary T S R Subramanian and lawyer M L Sharma seeking cancellation of coal block allocations. The petitioners contended the entire allocation made through the screening committee and government dispensation route by the central government after 1993 is in violation of the clear provisions of law and therefore illegal. ìInstead of acting on the categorical stand of the Coal Secretary in favour of competitive bidding, the government delayed its introduction for 8 years till February 2012. Since the screening committee had itself been constituted through an executive order, there was no legal hurdle in introduction of competitive bidding by an executive order,î advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for some petitioners, said. ìWith the proposed introduction of competitive bidding pending, this led to huge rush for the coal blocks under the old allotment system and the government allotted as many as 142 coal blocks between 2004 to 2009, with billions of tonnes of coal. Most of the blocks did not have an end-use plant in place and ultimately have not started coal production even after elapse of several years,î he said, pleading with the court t. o scrap the allocation. He said the policy followed in allocation of coal block was illegal and the state governments and its people are at great loss as they by themselves cannot raise the royalty. This submission prompted the bench to ask why the states have not so far raised this issue. ìIt is shocking that in the past decades no state asked for enhancing the royalty,î the bench said while Bhushan and Sharma said the law was not correctly followed in the allocation of coal in which the Centre has taken the role of state governments. The bench said the states should have raised this issue in their submissions which is also not there in their affidavits. ìInstead of the state governments recommending the applications, it is the Centre which is approving the applicants, that is why the states are saying that their role remains formal,î Bhushan said.

7,"Lew: Debt ceiling crunch to come sooner than thought. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it's likely he will run out of debt ceiling wiggle room at the end of February. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Treasury Secretary Jack Lew called on Congress Thursday to move soon to raise the nation's debt ceiling to ward off any risk of a U.S. default, saying the crunch will come by the end of next month. The nation's borrowing limit is suspended until Feb. 7. After that, unless Congress has authorized an increase or has chosen to extend the suspension, the Treasury Department will have to deploy special accounting maneuvers to continue to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. Originally Lew had estimated that those ""extraordinary measures"" could last until sometime between the end of February and early March. But on Thursday, in a public interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, Lew said he now believes it's most likely he'll run out of wiggle room by the end of February. It appears they may not finalize their strategy until their annual retreat at the end of January, although they may float trial balloons sooner than that, said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for the Potomac Research Group. But, Valliere said, it's a mid-term election year and ""they don't seem eager to fight or instigate a crisis when they're getting tremendous mileage out of bashing Obamacare."" House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Thursday ""we shouldn't even get close"" to defaulting. ""I would hope that the House and the Senate would act quickly on a bill to increase the debt limit."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, after first telling reporters that he believed lawmakers had until spring to address the issue, later walked back those comments. ""Senator Reid believes that the debt ceiling should be dealt with as soon as possible,"" a Reid spokesman said in a statement. ""Secretary Lew has recommended that Congress deal with this issue in February, and Senator Reid takes Secretary Lew's recommendations extremely seriously.""","Lew: Debt ceiling crunch to come sooner than thought - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/news/economy/lew-debt-ceiling/index.html

At the consumer level, most 3-D printing is done by hobbyists, who print everything from toys to clothes to musical instruments. Consumer 3-D printers start at about $1,000. But at the industrial level they are used to make manufacturing operations more efficient, making mostly high end products for the aerospace, medical or automotive sectors. Some think 3-D printing could soon revolutionize the manufacturing sector, cutting out the need for expensive transportation and making the whole concept of outsourcing seem so 20th century.","Hershey's to make 3-D chocolate printer - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/technology/3d-printer-chocolate/index.html
9,"Time Warner to sell HQ for $1.3 billion. Time Warner intends to acquire more than 1 million square feet in a new Manhattan development called Hudson Yards and move out of its current space in 2018. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Time Warner, one of the country's biggest media companies, is planning to combine its New York City offices at a new development known as Hudson Yards on the far west side of Manhattan. On Thursday, the company announced the $1.3 billion sale of the space it currently owns in the Time Warner Center and said it would move out in 2018. Time Warner also said it had signed an initial agreement and made an unspecified financial commitment for a new headquarters at 30 Hudson Yards. ""By consolidating our space to Hudson Yards, New York's next great neighborhood, we will be able to reallocate substantial savings to our primary business of creating and sharing great storytelling in television, film, and journalism with audiences around the world,"" Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner ( TWX , Fortune 500 ) , said in a statement. Time Warner is the parent company of CNN and Time Inc., the joint owners of CNNMoney. When Time Warner spins off Time Inc. later this year, CNNMoney will be wholly owned by CNN. That means the staff of this Web site will likely be among the thousands of employees who will be moving to 30 Hudson Yards in about five years. Thursday's announcement about the move confirms a plan that has been an open secret for some time. Behind NYC's biggest development. Time Warner says it is turning a substantial profit on the sale, having spent about $520 million on its floors inside the Time Warner Center, which it moved into in 2004. The larger complex that bears the company's name -- including a mall, three performance halls, an array of high-profile restaurants, condominiums, and a luxury hotel -- is credited with rejuvenating Columbus Circle, at the southwest corner of Central Park in New York City. Now Time Warner is selling its roughly one million square feet of office space to the real estate firm that developed the complex, Related Companies, and two of Related's financiers, sovereign-wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi. The group of new owners will pay $1.3 billion for the space and lease it back to Time Warner (for an unspecified price) until the company's move is complete. Time Warner's profits from the sale will help pay for the new, consolidated headquarters at Hudson Yards. Bewkes said the company started to look at its office space situation and consider a move to a new corporate headquarters about two years ago. At present, he said, Time Warner owns and leases space in seven different buildings in and around New York City. CNN, for instance, has New York studios and offices inside Time Warner Center while HBO has offices about a mile away. Bewkes said the consolidation would ""foster even more collaboration, creativity, and efficiency across our businesses."" While the final deals are not in place yet, Time Warner intends to acquire more than one million square feet of the 2.6 million square feet contained in the plans for 30 Hudson Yards. It estimated that about 5,000 employees from its three divisions -- HBO, Turner (which includes CNN) and Warner Bros. -- would be affected by the move. Time Warner is staying in business with Related, which is one of the developers of Hudson Yards. The development will sit atop a railroad yard near the Hudson River. Related says it is the largest such project in New York since Rockefeller Center.","Time Warner to sell HQ for $1.3 billion - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/news/companies/time-warner-move/index.html
10,"5 things we want for Windows 9. Windows 8 is chock-full of good ideas , but the execution is still lacking at times. As Windows 9 rumors swirl, here are five things we'd like to see Microsoft include. More layout flexibility: Windows 8's ""snap widgets"" essentially serve the same function as old-school windows in desktop mode. Snap widgets make productivity easier on tablets, allowing users to go back and forth between windows. But there is a lot of room for refinement. Being able to divide widgets into smaller tiles that could be arranged horizontally or vertically along a grid could help users go in and out of various apps much more seamlessly. And being able to quickly take an app into full screen mode and back would go a long way towards making the Windows layout feel less claustrophobic. Desktop-only mode: Although the Windows 8 tile display is adequate on a standard laptop, it's still not optimal for productivity tasks, particularly on a desktop computer. There are also many apps that only work in desktop mode. The abrupt move between Windows 8's starkly contrasting tile and desktop environments has left a bad taste in the mouths of many users. In Windows 9 -- or whatever the next big revision of Windows will be called -- users will be able to run those ""Modern"" apps in a window on the desktop , according to WinSuperSite's Paul Thurrott. If Microsoft also gave users the ability to lock their computers in desktop mode, that would help make the experience of using Windows on a laptop feel more consistent. Microsoft shouldn't give up on the Start Screen, but some users just don't need it. More consistent trackpad standards: Sometimes it seems like the trackpad on every single Windows 8 device feels different, making use of clicks and gestures in different ways. For example, unlocking the homescreen requires a swipe on some trackpads, and a click on others. At their best, exemplified by Logitech's standalone Windows 8 trackpad , gestures in Windows 8 are as quick and intuitive as touching a screen. At their worst, ironically exemplified by Microsoft's Surface tablet, gestures can be incredibly frustrating. If the next version of Windows could standardize the trackpad experience, it could go a long way towards making Windows more usable. Better Display Handling: One of the biggest problems facing Windows 8 is its inconsistent display settings. When connecting a PC to larger, more pixel-dense resolutions, settings that look good in tile mode don't look so great in desktop mode and vice versa. A second display only makes things more complicated. And that's before you consider the super-HD screens that PC makers are starting to use. Even if you manage to find a sweet spot, some settings will frequently revert back. If Microsoft really wants customers to love its new approach to Windows, the display has to look good in any mode, and on any device. More interactivity with Windows Phone and Xbox: Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and the Xbox One software are all built on top of the same foundation. They also share a suite of services and utilities that should function as a glue that binds each product. Yet, the overlap between the experiences on these devices is still lacking. Buying an app on Windows Phone doesn't mean you automatically have access to the corresponding Windows app. If you start a Skype conversation on your computer, there's no way to push it over to your phone. While there is basic functionality for streaming video from a Windows 8 device to the Xbox, it's often unreliable or half-baked. Multiplayer games have the potential to simultaneously span phones, tablets, computers, and consoles. Few companies are in a better position to facilitate this than Microsoft, but for now, the idea lies dormant. Being able to intuitively share media or move your work between devices should be a big consideration in the next era of Windows.","5 things we want for Windows 9 - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/technology/enterprise/windows-9/index.html
