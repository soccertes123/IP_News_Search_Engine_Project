1,"NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP's) stance against FDI in retail has come in for criticism by one of its recent high-profile entrants from the world of business. GR Gopinath or Captain Gopinath, the pioneer of low-cost aviation in India, who joined AAP in Bangalore on January 4, on Wednesday publicly disagreed with its decision to disallow majority foreign-owned supermarket groups from operating in Delhi, and warned that the party ran the danger of being ""branded like other political parties of resorting to cheap and populist measures"". Gopinath said the AAP-led government's decision to reverse its predecessor's permission for FDI in multi-brand retail would send a wrong message to investors that India is an unstable country with regard to economic policies. ""AAP is unwittingly also playing into the hands Indian oligopolies who were opposing FDI in retail so that they could have a monopoly... Which means it is okay for Indian corporates to rape India and not foreign retail. That's exactly what 'crony capitalism' is,"" he said. Gopinath, a former army captain-turned entrepreneur, said he personally believed allowing FDI in multi-brand retail, a September 2012 decision of the UPA government that became a litmus test of India's ability to undertake reforms, was a good idea and the opposition to it was from ""the old BJP lobby of small traders"". ""Opening up is good for the farmers and also the economy and the country. The view of small retailers is unfounded... No retail corporation can shake our Udupi hotels or mom-and-pop groceries. Even in the West, the corner store thrives. No Pizza Hut has dislodged Italian eateries,"" he said. ""AAP must step back and deliberate and not do anything in haste in terms of policy decisions."" AAP, which became a political sensation after it trounced the Congress in Delhi elections, has seen a steady stream of high-profile names sign up to become its members. Apart from Gopinath, former banker Meera Sanyal and former Infosys board member V Balakrishnan have joined the party.",GR Gopinath slams AAP's stand on FDI in retail - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/gr-gopinath-slams-aaps-stand-on-fdi-in-retail/articleshow/28860766.cms
2,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. Itís never too early for news TV to begin searching for the next prime minister. The next general elections are still three months away but TV news behaves as if theyíre being held tomorrow. Itís a case of back to the future, and the future is now. Thus, Times Now conducts live national debates on the weekend about issues for the elections and before the electorate. Watched Sitaram Yechury (CPM), Anand Sharma (Congress) and the BJPís Piyush Goel exchange barbs and accusations on your corruption versus mine, Sunday. Thus, CNN-IBN, Tuesday, began a new early evening show, A Billion Votes óBattle for 2014. It deemed the initiative worthy of Rajdeep Sardesaiís presence along with late evening studio regulars like Vinod Mehta, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Tavleen Singh. Subject? Rahul Gandhi as ìPM nominee ó too late or a gamechanger?î And thus, writer Chetan Bhagat has decided that ìDecision 2014î is important enough to require his services as an anchor of a new news feature, 7 Race Course Road (ABP). Thatís the most famous address in the NCR after Kaushambi, Ghaziabad where Arvind Kejriwal resides. The former is, of course, where Manmohan Singh is spending his last few months as Indiaís prime minister. The show is about those who may succeed him at the PMís official residence. And the first among equal aspirants is Gujaratís roving chief minister. Following the successful format of Pradhan Mantri, 7 Race Course Road mixed dramatic reconstructions with interviews, available visual and factual material on the BJPís PM candidate. We see a young Narendra Modi arrive in Ahmedabad, his sojourn at the tea stall, his shift to Sangh service and then to Gujarat student politics. It is a fascinating story and you can see why Bhagat wanted to host it. His debut is as youíd expect it to be: heís hesitant, needing to grow into the role and sound authoritative on the subject. Away from the world of politics, Chivas Studio Gentlemanís Code (Star World) promises, in the words of its host, writer Aatish Taseer, to take a long ìhard lookî at men. After the first episode, youíre left wondering if it didnít employ a soft touch. Imaginative in conceptualisation with segments alternating between black/ white and colour, unusual camera angles, readings interspersed with interviews and conversations, it looked at men in relation to women (mothers, changing women, whatever that means,), men and sex, without being revelatory. So while itís interesting to listen to Karan Johar on living with his mother, not getting married and his motherís wishing ìhe was a small boy againîwhen she ìowned himî, whatís new about the all-Indian mamaís boy? Or Chetan Bhagat (yes this is his week on TV) reading from his book and telling us men cannot accept that a woman theyíre involved with had sex with another man? Or about the two men who frequent an informal singles club and think that concepts like ìlove at first sightî are unrealistic? Or that men suffer from anxiety about sexual performance, that itís more for ìprocreation than recreationî in the words of a doctor ó most women could tell you that. And when Taseer and Priyanka Chopra claim to like item numbers, well, how could it be otherwise for Chopra, who appears in them? Gentlemanís Code is cleverly packaged, but hard-hitting? Letís wait for the next episode. A bit of this and that now: Salman Khan appeared on TV by Modiís side but said let the best man be PM; he also sang on Nach Baliye (Star Plus), as unusual an occurrence. His father, Salim Khan, sat beside Javed Akhtar and blamed himself for the professional scriptwriting break-up with Akhtar (CNN-IBN). Akhtarís son Farhan won the hamper on Koffee with Karan (Star World), much to the disgust of fellow guest Vidya Balan in the most enjoyable and entertaining episode of the more ìspicy, steamy seasonî, as Johar calls it. By the way, why the obsession with sexual innuendo and homosexuality in every episode? And thank you DD National for telecasting on Sunday Ishqiya, just after Dedh Ishqiya was released.

Just when you thought that you were broadening out and setting off for new lands, you will have to return to the realm of routine details and mundane trivia. However, you must realise that it is essential to build your future on firm foundations. CAPRICORN DEC 23-JAN 20. You are not fond of unnecessary change, but the moment seems to have arrived when you can no longer remain rooted in former times or refuse an opportunity to move to more hospitable surroundings. What you really need at the moment is security ñ but, by building for the future, not recreating the past. CANCER JUNE 22-JULY 23. Itís a profound moment in many ways. You are in the middle of an ongoing process of personal re-evaluation that is affecting both your practical and personal concerns. It is always useful to question your own motives, and this time youíll discover a whole new dimension to your feelings. LEO JULY 24-AUG 23. Please give others fair warning that you have had enough of delaying tactics. However, for as long as Mercury, planet of communication, is being obstructive, you must be both patient and flexible. Thatís because partners will take some time to realise that you are right. VIRGO AUG 24-SEPT 23.

A bench of justices P K Bhasin and J R Midha dismissed the bail plea of Shahzad, 25, who was awarded life term on July 30, 2013. He was convicted and sentenced for killing decorated police officer Inspector M C Sharma and injuring two other cops in the September 19, 2008 encounter when a team of Delhi Police Special Cell raided the Batla House flat in Jamia Nagar on a tip-off that terrorists involved in the September 13, 2008 serial blasts in the city were holed up there.

6,"Related. A three-judge bench headed by Justice R M Lodha, which had agreed to look into the alleged irregularities in coal block allocation on September 14, 2012, wrapped up the proceedings which witnessed the Centre itself putting in motion the process of de-allocating some coal blocks. The bench heard the arguments of all concerned parties involved in the allocation, including the seven mining states and the association of mining companies. Private companies contended any order of the apex court should have prospective effect and all the allocations should not be scrapped in one go and it should be decided on a case-to-case basis. ìIt is submitted that as far as the system of allocation is concerned, any challenge, even if successful, could have prospective effect where people have acted in a bona fide manner, assuming the machinery was in accordance with law. If there are irregularities in the grant, it is submitted that it would depend on the facts of an individual case as to the degree of the irregularities and whether it has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, in which case there could be a wholesale invalidation,î senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for associations of Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association, said. The court was hearing petitions filed by members of civil societies including former CEC N Gopalaswami, ex-Navy chief L Ramdas and former Cabinet Secretary T S R Subramanian and lawyer M L Sharma seeking cancellation of coal block allocations. The petitioners contended the entire allocation made through the screening committee and government dispensation route by the central government after 1993 is in violation of the clear provisions of law and therefore illegal. ìInstead of acting on the categorical stand of the Coal Secretary in favour of competitive bidding, the government delayed its introduction for 8 years till February 2012. Since the screening committee had itself been constituted through an executive order, there was no legal hurdle in introduction of competitive bidding by an executive order,î advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for some petitioners, said. ìWith the proposed introduction of competitive bidding pending, this led to huge rush for the coal blocks under the old allotment system and the government allotted as many as 142 coal blocks between 2004 to 2009, with billions of tonnes of coal. Most of the blocks did not have an end-use plant in place and ultimately have not started coal production even after elapse of several years,î he said, pleading with the court t. o scrap the allocation. He said the policy followed in allocation of coal block was illegal and the state governments and its people are at great loss as they by themselves cannot raise the royalty. This submission prompted the bench to ask why the states have not so far raised this issue. ìIt is shocking that in the past decades no state asked for enhancing the royalty,î the bench said while Bhushan and Sharma said the law was not correctly followed in the allocation of coal in which the Centre has taken the role of state governments. The bench said the states should have raised this issue in their submissions which is also not there in their affidavits. ìInstead of the state governments recommending the applications, it is the Centre which is approving the applicants, that is why the states are saying that their role remains formal,î Bhushan said.

7,"Lew: Debt ceiling crunch to come sooner than thought. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it's likely he will run out of debt ceiling wiggle room at the end of February. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Treasury Secretary Jack Lew called on Congress Thursday to move soon to raise the nation's debt ceiling to ward off any risk of a U.S. default, saying the crunch will come by the end of next month. The nation's borrowing limit is suspended until Feb. 7. After that, unless Congress has authorized an increase or has chosen to extend the suspension, the Treasury Department will have to deploy special accounting maneuvers to continue to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. Originally Lew had estimated that those ""extraordinary measures"" could last until sometime between the end of February and early March. But on Thursday, in a public interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, Lew said he now believes it's most likely he'll run out of wiggle room by the end of February. It appears they may not finalize their strategy until their annual retreat at the end of January, although they may float trial balloons sooner than that, said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for the Potomac Research Group. But, Valliere said, it's a mid-term election year and ""they don't seem eager to fight or instigate a crisis when they're getting tremendous mileage out of bashing Obamacare."" House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Thursday ""we shouldn't even get close"" to defaulting. ""I would hope that the House and the Senate would act quickly on a bill to increase the debt limit."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, after first telling reporters that he believed lawmakers had until spring to address the issue, later walked back those comments. ""Senator Reid believes that the debt ceiling should be dealt with as soon as possible,"" a Reid spokesman said in a statement. ""Secretary Lew has recommended that Congress deal with this issue in February, and Senator Reid takes Secretary Lew's recommendations extremely seriously.""","Lew: Debt ceiling crunch to come sooner than thought - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/news/economy/lew-debt-ceiling/index.html

But at the industrial level they are used to make manufacturing operations more efficient, making mostly high end products for the aerospace, medical or automotive sectors.

9,"Time Warner to sell HQ for $1.3 billion. Time Warner intends to acquire more than 1 million square feet in a new Manhattan development called Hudson Yards and move out of its current space in 2018. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Time Warner, one of the country's biggest media companies, is planning to combine its New York City offices at a new development known as Hudson Yards on the far west side of Manhattan. On Thursday, the company announced the $1.3 billion sale of the space it currently owns in the Time Warner Center and said it would move out in 2018. Time Warner also said it had signed an initial agreement and made an unspecified financial commitment for a new headquarters at 30 Hudson Yards. ""By consolidating our space to Hudson Yards, New York's next great neighborhood, we will be able to reallocate substantial savings to our primary business of creating and sharing great storytelling in television, film, and journalism with audiences around the world,"" Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner ( TWX , Fortune 500 ) , said in a statement. Time Warner is the parent company of CNN and Time Inc., the joint owners of CNNMoney. When Time Warner spins off Time Inc. later this year, CNNMoney will be wholly owned by CNN. That means the staff of this Web site will likely be among the thousands of employees who will be moving to 30 Hudson Yards in about five years. Thursday's announcement about the move confirms a plan that has been an open secret for some time. Behind NYC's biggest development. Time Warner says it is turning a substantial profit on the sale, having spent about $520 million on its floors inside the Time Warner Center, which it moved into in 2004. The larger complex that bears the company's name -- including a mall, three performance halls, an array of high-profile restaurants, condominiums, and a luxury hotel -- is credited with rejuvenating Columbus Circle, at the southwest corner of Central Park in New York City. Now Time Warner is selling its roughly one million square feet of office space to the real estate firm that developed the complex, Related Companies, and two of Related's financiers, sovereign-wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi. The group of new owners will pay $1.3 billion for the space and lease it back to Time Warner (for an unspecified price) until the company's move is complete. Time Warner's profits from the sale will help pay for the new, consolidated headquarters at Hudson Yards. Bewkes said the company started to look at its office space situation and consider a move to a new corporate headquarters about two years ago. At present, he said, Time Warner owns and leases space in seven different buildings in and around New York City. CNN, for instance, has New York studios and offices inside Time Warner Center while HBO has offices about a mile away. Bewkes said the consolidation would ""foster even more collaboration, creativity, and efficiency across our businesses."" While the final deals are not in place yet, Time Warner intends to acquire more than one million square feet of the 2.6 million square feet contained in the plans for 30 Hudson Yards. It estimated that about 5,000 employees from its three divisions -- HBO, Turner (which includes CNN) and Warner Bros. -- would be affected by the move. Time Warner is staying in business with Related, which is one of the developers of Hudson Yards. The development will sit atop a railroad yard near the Hudson River. Related says it is the largest such project in New York since Rockefeller Center.","Time Warner to sell HQ for $1.3 billion - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/news/companies/time-warner-move/index.html
10,"5 things we want for Windows 9. Windows 8 is chock-full of good ideas , but the execution is still lacking at times. As Windows 9 rumors swirl, here are five things we'd like to see Microsoft include. More layout flexibility: Windows 8's ""snap widgets"" essentially serve the same function as old-school windows in desktop mode. Snap widgets make productivity easier on tablets, allowing users to go back and forth between windows. But there is a lot of room for refinement. Being able to divide widgets into smaller tiles that could be arranged horizontally or vertically along a grid could help users go in and out of various apps much more seamlessly. And being able to quickly take an app into full screen mode and back would go a long way towards making the Windows layout feel less claustrophobic. Desktop-only mode: Although the Windows 8 tile display is adequate on a standard laptop, it's still not optimal for productivity tasks, particularly on a desktop computer. There are also many apps that only work in desktop mode. The abrupt move between Windows 8's starkly contrasting tile and desktop environments has left a bad taste in the mouths of many users. In Windows 9 -- or whatever the next big revision of Windows will be called -- users will be able to run those ""Modern"" apps in a window on the desktop , according to WinSuperSite's Paul Thurrott. If Microsoft also gave users the ability to lock their computers in desktop mode, that would help make the experience of using Windows on a laptop feel more consistent. Microsoft shouldn't give up on the Start Screen, but some users just don't need it. More consistent trackpad standards: Sometimes it seems like the trackpad on every single Windows 8 device feels different, making use of clicks and gestures in different ways. For example, unlocking the homescreen requires a swipe on some trackpads, and a click on others. At their best, exemplified by Logitech's standalone Windows 8 trackpad , gestures in Windows 8 are as quick and intuitive as touching a screen. At their worst, ironically exemplified by Microsoft's Surface tablet, gestures can be incredibly frustrating. If the next version of Windows could standardize the trackpad experience, it could go a long way towards making Windows more usable. Better Display Handling: One of the biggest problems facing Windows 8 is its inconsistent display settings. When connecting a PC to larger, more pixel-dense resolutions, settings that look good in tile mode don't look so great in desktop mode and vice versa. A second display only makes things more complicated. And that's before you consider the super-HD screens that PC makers are starting to use. Even if you manage to find a sweet spot, some settings will frequently revert back. If Microsoft really wants customers to love its new approach to Windows, the display has to look good in any mode, and on any device. More interactivity with Windows Phone and Xbox: Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and the Xbox One software are all built on top of the same foundation. They also share a suite of services and utilities that should function as a glue that binds each product. Yet, the overlap between the experiences on these devices is still lacking. Buying an app on Windows Phone doesn't mean you automatically have access to the corresponding Windows app. If you start a Skype conversation on your computer, there's no way to push it over to your phone. While there is basic functionality for streaming video from a Windows 8 device to the Xbox, it's often unreliable or half-baked. Multiplayer games have the potential to simultaneously span phones, tablets, computers, and consoles. Few companies are in a better position to facilitate this than Microsoft, but for now, the idea lies dormant. Being able to intuitively share media or move your work between devices should be a big consideration in the next era of Windows.","5 things we want for Windows 9 - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/technology/enterprise/windows-9/index.html

There is ìzero evidenceî that last yearís crippling George Washington Bridge closures were part of a ìlegitimate traffic studyî by the Port Authority, a leading US senator charged Thursday. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, chairman of the powerful Commerce Committee, said a 12-page letter from the PA shows that its officials tied to the ìBridgegateî scandal ìdid not follow their agencyís own proceduresî and engage in ìcareful planning and communicationî before closing access lanes that caused four days of massive tie-ups in September. ìThe Port Authorityís response provides zero evidence that the purpose of these closures was to conduct a legitimate traffic study,î Rockefeller said.

Cops didnít name the fiance, but said they had been to the home before on domestic calls. ìWe were there the night before,î a police spokesman said. ìThere was a civil issue. They had a fight and he came to pick up his property.î Neighbors said they saw the man loading boxes into a U-Haul truck earlier Tuesday. Neighbor Joe Peterson came home just as cops were showing up and told the Standard-Examiner newspaper the fiance ñ who had also just arrived to gather the last of his belongings ñ looked distraught. îWhy do that?î he kept asking, according to Peterson. Petersonís wife Karlene had called the police to report the gunshots. Cops interviewed the fiance but ruled him out as a suspect. Bryan Smith, a friend of Ramsdell-Oliva, called her as a ìgreat personî and was stunned by the senseless tragedy. ìI just thought Kyler was one of the most excitable, vibrant, fun persons Iíve ever known,î Smith told the paper. ìThis really surprises me and shocks me to hear this news.î The younger girl was a first-grader at Syracuse Elementary School and the older an eighth-grader at Syracuse Junior High School.

14,"GLENDORA, Calif. ó†Nearly 2,000 residents were evacuated and two homes burned in a wildfire that started early Thursday when three people tossed paper into a campfire in the dangerously dry foothills of Southern Californiaís San Gabriel Mountains, authorities said. Embers from the fire fanned by gusty Santa Ana winds quickly spread into neighborhoods below where residents were awakened in the pre-dawn darkness and ordered to evacuate. The three suspects, all men in their 20s, were arrested on charges of recklessly starting the fire that spread smoke across the Los Angeles basin and cast an eerie cloud all the way to the coast. One resident suffered minor burns in the neighborhood abutting Angeles National Forest, just north of the San Gabriel Valley community of Glendora, according to Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl L. Osby. ìBecause of our preparations, we were able to save hundreds, if not thousands, of homes this morning,î Osby said. At least 2 Ω square miles of dry brush were charred in the wilderness area about 25 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Police said the three suspects were detained near Colby Trail, where the fire was believed to have started. At least one was homeless, Glendora Police Chief Tim Staab said. One of the suspects is from Irwindale and the other from Glendora. The notorious Santa Anas, linked to the spread of Southern Californiaís worst wildfires , picked up at daybreak. The extremely dry Santa Anas blow downslope and can push fires out of the mountains and into communities below. The area, which has been historically dry, has been buffeted by the winds which have raised temperatures into the 80s. The Santa Anas typically begin in the fall and last through winter into spring. A wet winter reduces fire risk, but the whole state is experiencing historically dry conditions. TV news helicopters spotted embers igniting palm trees in residential yards as firefighters with hoses beat back flames lapping at the edges of homes. Homes are nestled in canyons and among rugged ridges that made access difficult. Glendora police said officers went door to door ordering residents of the city of 50,000 to leave. Citrus College, located in the heart of Glendora, canceled classes for the day. Several schools were closed. The Glendora Unified School District closed Goddard Middle School, which was being used as a fire department command post. District spokeswoman Michelle Hunter said 900 students attend the school, which is near the fire and within the evacuation area. Between 1,700 and 2,000 residents were evacuated and the order included 880 homes in Glendora and the neighboring foothill city of Azusa. Many residents, some wearing masks, used garden hoses to wet the brush around their houses, even as firefighters ordered them to leave. ìDonít waste any more time with the water. Time to go,î a firefighter ordered. More than 700 firefighters were on the scene. The Los Angeles County Fire Department deployed seven engines and three helicopters to the fire, which was reported around 5:50 a.m. (PST) and grew rapidly. Officials added to the firefighting aircraft with a water-dropping Super Scooper plane. Ash rained down on the city, said Jonathan Lambert, 31, general manager of Classic Coffee. ìWeíre underneath a giant cloud of smoke,î he said. ìItís throwing quite the eerie shadow over a lot of Glendora.î A man was photographed on the roof of a home talking on a cellphone as he surveyed the smoke-choked sky. The smoke spread across metropolitan Los Angeles to the coast and was visible from space in Weather Service satellite photos. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a smoke advisory and urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities in areas directly impacted by the smoke. Jennifer Riedel, 43, anxiously watched as the orange-hued plume descended on her neighborhood in Azusa. ìI woke up from the rattling windows from the helicopters overhead, and I heard the police over the P.A., but I couldnít hear what they were saying,î Riedel said. ìIím hearing from neighbors that weíre evacuating, but Iím waiting for a knock on the door.î Riedel said her husband left for work early and she was getting her children, ages 5 and 7, ready to evacuate. ìTheyíre a little nervous, but Iím keeping calm for them,î she said. ìIíve been loading the car up with important papers and getting the kids dressed. Weíll just take some essentials and get going if we have to.î The last catastrophic fire in the San Gabriel Mountains broke out in 2009 and burned for months. The flames blackened 250 square miles, killed two firefighters and destroyed 209 structures, including 89 homes. California is in a historically dry era and winter has brought no relief. Red flag warnings for critical fire weather conditions were posted from Santa Barbara County south through Los Angeles to the U.S.-Mexico border, along the spine of the Sierra Nevada, and in areas east and north of San Francisco Bay. Fires that struck windy areas of the state earlier in the week were quickly quashed by large deployments of firefighters, aircraft and other equipment before the flames could be stoked by gusts into major conflagrations. Large parts of Southern California below mountain passes, canyons and foothills have been buffeted all week by the regionís notorious Santa Ana winds. Spawned by surface high pressure over the interior of the West, the Santa Anas form as the cold air flows toward Southern California, then speeds up and warms as it descends in a rush toward the coast. Some of the most extreme gusts reported by the National Weather Service topped 70 mph. These offshore winds also raise temperatures to summerlike levels. Many areas have enjoyed temperatures well into the 80s. California is also under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has also kept the region generally warm, dry and clear.","Wildfire threatens LA homes, hundreds evacuated | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/wildfire-threatens-la-homes-hundreds-evacuated/

16,"Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade had told her domestic help, Sangeeta Richard, not to fall ill since getting medical treatment for her in New York would be expensive, according to papers filed by US attorney Preet Bharara in a New York court to indict her. The maid was made to work for extremely long hours and without a single entire day off, according to the indictment filed against Khobragade, which was made public Wednesday. After two months, she was allowed to visit the church on Sunday, but had to cook all meals before going and had to work till 10 pm after returning, it stated. It further stated that Khobragade made the domestic help work up to 100 or more hours per week which, based on the promised salary of $573 per month, would result in an actual hourly wage of $1.42 per hour or less.†Khobragade, meanwhile, has asked the court to dismiss her indictment against her and terminate any ìopenî arrest warrants in the visa fraud case, arguing that she was ìcloakedî in diplomatic immunity and cannot face criminal prosecution in the US. The indictment also stated that Khobragade did not give the victim any holidays or sick leave. ìIndeed, on two occasions when the victim became ill, the victim was not given a sick day. On one occasion, the victim had to ask to see a doctor several times before Khobragade relented. Khobragade told the victim not to get sick because it was expensive,î it said.†ìFor approximately the first two months of the victimís employment, the victim worked seven days a week. Khobragade told the victim that she would not have any days off because the victim was paid Rs 30,000 per month, which covered overtime hours. After about two months, the victim requested to be given some time off on Sundays to attend church. Khobragade permitted the victim to take time off on Sundays approximately from 10.30 am to 5.30 or 6.30 pm, only on days when Khobragadeís husband was home. On those instances, the victim was required to prepare all meals for Sundays in advance, and on Sundays when the victim returned to the Khobragade US residence, the victim was required to work until 9.30 or 10 pm,î the indictment paper said.†ìBeginning in or about February 2013, the victim told Khobragade on several occasions that the victim wished to end her employment and return to India, because the victim felt she was being mistreated. Khobragade denied her requests,î it said. The US authorities accused Khobragade of helping the domestic help in submitting fake documents to the US State Department, saying that she was paying $4,500 per month, when in reality, the domestic help got only $573 a month.†Khobragade had hired Richard in 2012 and she was working as a babysitter and domestic help at her house in the upscale Manhattan area of New York till last June.",ëDevyani told maid not to fall ill in New Yorkí | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/devyani-told-maid-not-to-fall-ill-in-new-york/
17,"Related. Claiming that the Congress and Samajwadi Party failed in handling the communal riots of Muzaffarnagar, BSP chief Mayawati on Wednesday called for Dalit-Muslim unity to weaken ìcommunal forcesî, which were growing stronger in the country. She appealed to Muslims to vote for her party in the coming Lok Sabha elections to keep the BJP away. In her address at her partyís Savdhan Rally at Ramabai Ambedkar rally ground, she also attacked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying he should not call Dalits and people from other backward communities ìaam aadmiî because they continue to face atrocities across the country. Addressing the huge gathering on her 58th birthday, the former chief minister said while the Congress-led central government failed to impose Presidentís rule in the state after the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts to restore harmony, the top SP leadership was busy enjoying a Bollywood dance and song programme at Saifai, the native place of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, instead of helping the victims in relief camps. Stressing that there is a need to form Dalit-Muslim ìbhaicharaî (brotherhood), she said the BJP can never form the government if the Muslim community unitedly votes for BSP. She said if voted to power, her party will ìhonestly pay special attentionî to implement the recommendations of the Sachar Committee.† ìSamajwadi Party ki tarah koi dhokha aur anyay nahin hone diya jayega (There will be no betrayal or injustice the way SP has done),î Mayawati alleged. The BSP has already named 18 Muslim candidates for the Lok Sabha elections. Mayawati said the BSPís Dalit base has always stood by the Muslims and the latter feel safe with the BSP. ìThe BSP has a record that no communal riots took place during its government in UP,î she said. Mayawati reiterated her party will not have any alliance with any party for coming Lok Sabha elections. She said that appointing Muslims as DGP and Chief Secretary, like the SP government has done, will not help the Muslims because ìgoons and mafia have capturedî the state government. ìI did not allow any atrocity to happen on Muslims despite Hindu officers being appointed at these posts,î she said. Slamming BJPís PM candidate Narendra Modi, she said Gujarat CM has announced building of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patelís ìstatue of unityî only for political gains. ìHow can a man who failed. to stop the Hindu-Muslim riots after the Godhra incident create unity and bhaichara between the various castes and religions of the country,î she said. She said while Modi claims to replicate the Gujarat model at the national level, every third child is malnourished in his state and there was no anti-corruption body like Lokayukta there for a long time.† Mayawati alleged that the Congress, BJP and SP came together to defeat the BSP in 2009 Lok Sabha elections to stop a Dalitís daughter from becoming the PM. She said her party will emerge as ìbalance of powerî in the next Lok Sabha. Hitting out at AAP, Mayawati said Kejriwal should not count the Dalits and backwards with his own Baniya community and tag them as Aam Aadmi as they face social unequality. She said SCs are stopped from entering the temples and have to leave their houses to save their lives in Haryana ó the home state of Kejriwal.

18,"Snapchat's porn bot problem. A new type of spam is emerging on popular photo-sharing app Snapchat: porn bots. Snapchat users are increasingly receiving spam messages with nude photos , according to security researchers at Symantec . The spam messages are automated, but they are designed to look like they are coming from a real person. The nude photos don't appear until a Snapchat user accepts a porn bot as a friend, but that would be an easy mistake for some to make. The spam messages appear with photo of a nude woman. A caption below asks the recipient to add ""her"" as a friend on messaging app Kik to receive more nude pictures. If the user follows through with the request, he or she will be prompted to download a mobile application. The mobile applications vary -- many are games. The porn bot then promises more nude pictures in exchange for a screenshot proving the game was installed. ""The idea of using naked pictures or a secret admirer -- that technique has been around forever,"" said Kevin Haley, director of Symantec's security response team. ""How it's going to be used in this particular case is specific to this application, so we're seeing a new twist on an old trick."" Haley says the mobile app developers aren't likely behind the scam. Instead, the perpetrators are the firms the app makers hire to help increase downloads. ""They're getting paid to get users to download this application,"" Haley speculates. ""The vendor of the application doesn't really care how they do it, so they can come up with some creative ways... in essence they fool users or trick them into downloading this application and now the mobile application vendor has a lot of new users."" It's a common tactic, according to Tom Ritte, a researcher at security company iSEC. Though some are aware of the tactics, many app makers don't even know they're partnering with spammers. ""The shady people get a commission for each install they generate, and they turn to spam to do it,"" he said. The spam problem is just the latest on a long list of Snapchat's growing pains. The app has come under fire for a security flaw that exposed usernames and phone numbers. Last year, security researchers also found ways for hackers to recover supposedly deleted photos. Apps like Snapchat that quickly grow in popularity are often in a rush to gain market share without having proper security in place, Haley says. ""Part of their growing pains will be to experience this kind of thing,"" he said. ""Whatever the next application that has a lot of users you're going to have a lot of people trying to figure out how to take advantage.""","Snapchat's porn bot problem - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/technology/social/snapchat-spam-porn/index.html
19,"India market for the country's largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) dropped by almost 9% on a sequential basis, said company's CEO and MD N Chandrasekaran after the company announced a better-than-expected third quarter profit. ""Except for India market, every other market grew,"" he said. The IT giant saw a 3.8% growth in international business in dollar terms; while volumes from international business grew by 2.9%. In fact, North America contributed 52.7% to the company's revenue in the quarter ended December 31. ""It was a quarter of very high performance in terms of cash flows. It was the best in recent times. We added customers across the board; and deal flow was good,"" Chandrasekaran said. ""Indications for the next fiscal year are looking good. We look into the future very confidently,"" he said. Buoyed by this stronger-than-expected third quarter performance, TCS said it would be hiring 5,000 more people this fiscal year as against its initial target of 50,000. It was in October 2013, when the IT giant reported its September quarter results, that it had raised its hiring target by 5,000 to 50,000. ""The increase in the hiring target was expected as they have already reached the previous target for the year,"" said Bhavin Shah , CEO, Equirus Securities. ""Demand outlook is strong, and TCS is expected to do better in FY15. So, that is probably why they have hiked the hiring target,"" he said.

TCS today reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 5,333 crore for the third quarter ended December 31. ET Now Poll had estimated the figure to be at Rs 5,124.50 crore. The company had reported at profit of Rs 4,633 crore in Q2. Dollar revenues were at $3,438 million for the quarter versus $3,337 million, up 3%. Sales for the third quarter came in at Rs 21,294 crore. Volumes growth at 1.8% came in as a big disappointment as the Street was expecting the figure to be at around 3%. In the previous quarter volumes growth was at 7%. This low figure is being seen on account of the seasonality factor, with lesser number of working days in the quarter. Operating margins came in at 29.8%. The realisations for the quarter were up 74 basis points. The stock hit an intra-day high of Rs 2,380.00 and a low of Rs 2,321.10. After rallying over 70 per cent in 2013, the IT major is putting up a strong show in 2014; having gained nearly 10 per cent so far in the year. From the stock market perspective, historically TCS has seen profit booking after the announcement of results and hence experts are advising traders to adopt a cautious stance. Investors who own the IT stock should hold on to it as the stock is likely to move higher following earnings upgrades over the next few quarters, say experts.

21,"The second generation (2G) auction process has got under way with telecom companies yesterday submitting their applications to participate in the spectrum sale that is slated to begin on February 3. Yesterday was the deadline for putting in bids for the auction. Apart from telecom giants like Bharti, Vodafone and Idea; Reliance Jio is also in the fray. The previous two rounds of 2G auction saw a tepid response, but the coming one looks much aggressive with the surprise entry of Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio. It may be noted that RIL is the only pan-India BWA player, but it does not have voice spectrum. The coming auction gives the company the opportunity to get high-end 2G specturm, that is 900 Mhz. A day after the players submitted their bids, Credit Suisse downgraded Bharti Airtel to 'neutral' and Idea Cellular to 'underperform'. The global financial services company said the entry of Reliance Jio is likely to infuse intense competition in the auctions, and will impact Airtel and Idea. ""We build 150-250 bps revenue market share loss for Bharti/Idea over the FY15/FY16 (along with reversal of the recent RPM increases),"" said a Credit Suisse report. Shares of Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications plunged 3-6 per cent in morning trade on Thursday on concerns over the possibility of high bidding prices at the spectrum auction . Bhart Airtel plunged as much as 4.8 per cent, Idea Cellular dropped as much as 6.6 per cent and Reliance Communications dropped 3.7 per cent in today's intraday trade. Credit Suisse said Reliance's entry could mean ""intense"" bidding at the auction, and increase competition in the sector in the longer term, Reuters reported. Eight telecom operators have applied for the spectrum auction; and Credit Suisse sees higher-than-expected bid applications as a ""negative surprise"". It cut the target price on Idea Cellular to Rs 130 from Rs 190 earlier. The brokerage firm has also slashed earnings of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular by 22-38 per cent for FY15/16. Bharti Infratel is the only stock with 'outperform' rating. But some analysts believe that the entry of Reliance Jio is not a threat to Airtal and Idea. ""We do not believe that will be a threat for the incumbent players as our analysis shows there is actually no viable business case for any greenfield telecom venture. The same has been proven over the last couple of times also, including in 2008 when new players started to enter in,"" says Gautam Chhaochharia, Head-India Research, UBS. ""Again, markets do worry about them springing a surprise about some technology angle, etc, which is difficult to take a call on. Purely from business case perspective, it does not seem to be a threat to us; and we retain our bullish stance on both Bharti and Idea,"" Chhaochharia adds. But then if Reliance Jio indeed gets the voice licence, one could be staring at a big price war because Reliance has a lot of cash on their balance sheet, and they can afford to crack the price to gain market share? ""Yes and no. One is the presumption is that Reliance will be willing to burn that kind of cash, it is not capital investment but just burning cash. The second call is whether from current low level of tariffs, what are the kind of tariffs which Reliance can offer or will offer ...We have seen new players few years back in 2008-2009 also trying to come up with aggressive tariffs. That did not help the case,"" says Chhaochharia. Rajan S Mathews, Director General, COAI, agrees. ""We don't think there would be any pressure on other players. We believe so because of two particular dynamics. One that a lot more rationality has come back into the market. We've seen what price wars can do to the whole industry. Second, you can't have extremely high bid prices for spectrum and expect to have low retail tariff prices; the economics just doesn't work.""",Will Reliance Jio spoil 2G party for Airtel and Idea? - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/will-reliance-jio-spoil-2g-party-for-airtel-and-idea/articleshow/28891620.cms
22,"Wanted: Young adults enrolling in Obamacare. Some young people, like Arie Lipinski, 26, don't think Obamacare is affordable. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Still missing from Obamacare? Enough young people. Only about a quarter of those who signed up so far are between the ages of 18 and 34, lower than the roughly 40% share that the White House and independent experts had originally forecast. So will enough young adults sign up by the time open enrollment ends March 31? It depends on whom you ask. The Obama administration and some of its supporters say they expect many more young adults to enroll closer to the March deadline. To help ensure that, they plan to continue reaching out to this target population to educate them about the insurance plans and subsidies available on the exchange. But some insurance industry experts are not so sure Obamacare will meet the crucial targets in time. ""There will be a rush of people at the end of March, but they may not skew younger,"" said Chris Carlson, principal at Oliver Wyman, an actuarial firm that helps insurers set premium prices based on their enrollee pools. ""It will take a pretty big shift from what we've been seeing so far to get to the original assumptions, which is what insurers based their pricing on."" Hackers sound off on Obamacare website. The basic reason why everyone is so focused on young adults signing up for coverage is because it's presumed they are healthier and less costly to insurers. And if insurers end up with a more expensive group of policyholders, they will likely raise rates for 2015. The insurance industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude. ""We have to look at the entire six month open enrollment period,"" said Clare Krusing, spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans. ""If the young and healthy choose not to purchase coverage and only older, costlier individuals sign up, then costs will increase across the board."" Problems with the exchanges -- particularly the federal exchange , which is handling enrollment for 36 states -- deterred many young people from initially signing up, said Amy Lin, deputy policy and organizing director for the Young Invincibles, which is working with the administration to attract this target market. The technical issues also prompted groups to delay outreach and marketing efforts. But over the next three months, Obamacare supporters and the administration plan to target this age group with advertising, educational and other outreach campaigns. The Young Invincibles will focus on getting the word out at cultural events, such as the Super Bowl, Valentine's Day and the March Madness college basketball tournament, as well as through social media. The Obama administration, meanwhile, is expanding outreach efforts in the 25 cities with the highest uninsured population served by the federal exchange, as well as running advertisements on entertainment and sports programming, including ""Family Guy"" and the Winter Olympics. Be Covered Texas, which is spearheaded by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, last month used a social media platform called Thunderclap to spread the word about the Dec. 23 deadline to get coverage by Jan. 1, said Dan McCoy, the insurer's chief medical officer. It reached more than 668,000 people on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Be Covered also sends text updates in English and Spanish to young adults to inform them of deadlines and other enrollment issues. And on Thursday, a group of state health exchanges and their partners are hosting a six-hour YouTube live event called ""Tell a Friend -- Get Covered."" The event will feature celebrities, including comedy sketches from humor site Funny or Die, is aimed at getting young adults to spread the word about getting health insurance. Key to attracting young adults is informing them about the federal subsidies available to individuals earning below $46,000 and families of four with income below $94,200. ""Young adults want to get covered,"" Lin said. ""The reason they didn't get insurance in the past was because it wasn't affordable."" Raising the overall rate of younger enrollees will be tough, but it's also important to attract the right kind of younger Americans, said Jim O'Connor, principal with Milliman, an actuarial firm. For instance, it would not be good if young women outnumber men since women use more medical services, he said. Also, insurers want to have a good share of healthy younger people, not ones who will heavily use their policies. And insurers want a sizable share of 35- to 44-year-olds since they can also help offset the costs of older enrollees, O'Connor said. Also, the national number doesn't matter as much as the local mix. The first three months of enrollment show a wide variation, with young adults making up 43% of the applicants in Washington D.C., but only 17% in Arizona and Maine. No amount of outreach will convince some young adults to sign up. They simply don't think that Obamacare makes financial sense for them. Arie Lipinski had planned on enrolling in Obamacare ... until he saw how much it would cost him. The 26-year-old has incurred thousands of dollars in medical bills over the past year after breaking his ankle slipping in the snow last January and his jaw in a basketball game in November. An attorney at a small firm in Carmel, Ind., he makes too much for a subsidy but feels he can't justify paying $184 for a catastrophic plan. Aside from his broken bones, he rarely visits a doctor. ""I don't think I'm likely to get sick or injured further so it's a risk I'm willing to take currently,"" he said.","Wanted: Young adults enrolling in Obamacare - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/news/economy/obamacare-young/index.html
23,"U.S. charges Wal-Mart over protesting workers. Wal-Mart workers have been protesting against the company since November 2012. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Federal officials have filed a complaint against Wal-Mart for allegedly retaliating against workers who staged Black Friday protests in 2012. The National Labor Relations Board, which protects the rights of workers who organize for better working conditions, is taking a next step in a case against Wal-Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) for alleged unfair labor practices. The agency had warned in November that the complaint could be filed. The complaint, filed Tuesday and circulated Wednesday by union representatives, details times when Wal-Mart allegedly illegally threatened ""reprisal"" against workers who protested on November 22, 2012, both on national television and to employees directly. The agency also said Wal-Mart stores in 14 states unlawfully threatened or disciplined workers who participated in legal strikes and protests. The complaint involves more than 60 employees, 19 of whom were allegedly fired as a result of their participation in the protests. It also named more than 60 Wal-Mart supervisors and one corporate officer. The complaint means that Wal-Mart will face a hearing in front of an administrative law judge of the NLRB. A date has not been set for the hearing, but Wal-Mart has until January 28 to respond. Wal-Mart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said the filing is just a procedural step, and it gives the company an opportunity to present the facts in the case. ""We don't believe it's reasonable or okay for people to come and go from their scheduled shifts as part of a union-orchestrated PR move and not be held accountable,"" she said.

24,"BRISTOL, Conn. ó Boston police have been investigating whether jailed former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez may have been the gunman in a 2012 double slaying, according to a search warrant released Thursday. Hernandez, who is awaiting trial on murder charges in a 2013 shooting near his home, was seen on surveillance footage in the same nightclub as the victims on the night of the attack in Bostonís South End, authorities have said. But newly released documents in Connecticut confirm for the first time that police suspect Hernandez could have carried out the shooting. No charges have been filed in the deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, who were killed on July 16, 2012, when somebody inside an SUV opened fire on their car. A third person was shot but survived. A June 28 Boston police affidavit, released by Superior Court in Bristol, Conn., says there is probable cause to believe that Hernandez was driving the vehicle used in the shooting and ìmay have been the shooter.î The affidavit was filed as police sought to search an SUV they say was involved in the shooting and was found at Hernandezís uncleís home in Bristol, where Hernandez was raised. The SUV had been given to Hernandez by a Rhode Island company in exchange for participating in promotional activities, according to court filings. Authorities found the SUV while investigating the slaying of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player whose body was found June 17 near Hernandezís North Attleborough, Mass., home.

25,"LUCASVILLE, Ohio (AP) ó A condemned Ohio inmate appeared to gasp several times and took more than 15 minutes to die Thursday as he was executed with a combination of drugs never before tried in the U.S. Death row inmate Dennis McGuire made several loud snorting or snoring sounds during one of the longest executions since Ohio resumed capital punishment in 1999. In attempting to halt his execution with the new method, McGuireís attorneys had argued last week he was at substantial risk of ìagony and terrorî while straining to catch his breath as he experienced a medical phenomenon known as air hunger. Ohio officials used intravenous doses of two drugs, the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone, to put McGuire to death for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of a pregnant woman, Joy Stewart. The new execution method was adopted after supplies of a previously used drug dried up because the manufacturer put it off limits for capital punishment. Before he died, McGuire thanked Stewartís family for their ìkind wordsî in a letter he apparently received from them. ìIím going to heaven, Iíll see you there when you come,î he said. McGuireís adult children sobbed a few feet away in a witness room at the state death house in Lucasville in southern Ohio. McGuire opened and shut his left hand as if waving to his daughter, son and daughter-in-law. More than a minute later he raised himself up, looked in the direction of his family and said, ìI love you. I love you.î McGuire was still for almost five minutes, then emitted a loud snort, as if snoring, and continued to make that sound over the next several minutes. He also soundlessly opened and shut his mouth several times as his stomach rose and fell. ìOh my God,î his daughter, Amber McGuire, said as she observed her fatherís final moments. A coughing sound was Dennis McGuireís last apparent movement, at 10:43 a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later. Previous executions with the former execution method took much less time, and typically did not include the types of snorts and gasps that McGuire uttered. State attorneys had disputed claims that McGuire would experience terror as he was put to death with the new method. A federal judge sided with the state but acknowledged the new method was an experiment. At the request of McGuireís lawyers, Judge Gregory Frost ordered the state to photograph and then preserve the drugsí packaging boxes and vials and the syringes used in the execution. Federal public defender Allen Bohnert called McGuireís death ìa failed, agonizing experiment by the state of Ohio.î ìThe courtís concerns expressed earlier this week have been confirmed,î said Bohnert, who did not witness the execution. ìAnd more importantly, the people of the state of Ohio should be appalled at what was done here today in their names.î McGuire, 53, was put to death for killing Stewart, a newlywed who was eight months pregnant at the time of her death, in western Ohioís Preble County. ìWe have forgiven him, but that does not negate the need for him to pay for his actions,î said a statement released by Carol Avery, Stewartís sister, after McGuireís death. Stewartís slaying went unsolved for 10 months until McGuire, jailed on an unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation, told investigators he had information about the womanís Feb. 12, 1989, death. His attempts to blame the crime on his brother-in-law quickly unraveled and soon he was accused of being Stewartís killer, according to prosecutors. More than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuireís guilt, and he acknowledged that he was responsible in a letter to Gov. John Kasich last month. ìOne can scarcely conceive of a sequence of crimes more shocking to the conscience or to moral sensibilities than the senseless kidnapping and rape of a young, pregnant woman followed by her murder,î Preble County prosecutors said in a filing with the state parole board last month. His attorneys argued McGuire was mentally, physically and sexually abused as a child and has impaired brain function that makes him prone to act impulsively. ìDennis was at risk from the moment he was born,î the lawyers said in a parole board filing. ìThe lack of proper nutrition, chaotic home environment, abuse, lack of positive supervision and lack of positive role models all affected Dennisí brain development.î Documents obtained by The Associated Press show McGuire unsuccessfully sought a reprieve in recent weeks to try to become an organ donor. In November, Kasich granted a death row inmate an eight-month reprieve to let the prison system study his request to donate a kidney to his sister and his heart to his mother. Kasich said McGuire couldnít identify a family member who would receive his organs, as required under prison policy.",New lethal injection drugs take 15 minutes to kill Ohio inmate | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/new-lethal-injection-drugs-take-15-minutes-to-kill-ohio-inmate/
26,"A $1.1 trillion spending bill for operating the government until just before next fallís election steamed through the battle-weary House on Wednesday over tepid protests from tea party conservatives, driven by a bipartisan desire to restore painful cuts in domestic and defense programs and show disaffected voters that Congress can do its job. The bill swept through the House on a 359-67 vote and was on track for a big Senate vote by weekís end. Republicans voted for the bill by a 2 1/2-1 margin, and just three Democrats were opposed. The measure funds virtually every agency of government and contains compromises on almost every one of its 1,582 pages. It covers the one-third of government spending subject to annual decisions by Congress and the White House, programs that have absorbed the brunt of budget cuts racked up since Republicans reclaimed control of the House three years ago. Excluded are the giant benefits programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps that run on autopilot and are increasingly driving the government deeper into debt. Tea party Republicans, chastened after sparking a 16-day partial shutdown of the government in October in a kamikaze attempt to derail President Barack Obamaís health care law, appeared resigned to the bill. ìI donít think thereís going to be a lot of opposition,î one tea party leader, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said before the vote. ìThe die has been cast for the next year on budget fights.î To buy time for the Senate debate, Congress on Wednesday sent President Barack Obama a three-day funding bill in time to avert a scheduled shutdown at midnight. The Senate cleared that measure by an 86-14 vote. The bill increases core agency spending by $26 billion over the fiscal 2013 year that began Oct. 1, after last yearís automatic spending cuts took them to $986 billion. But itís $31 billion less than Congress passed last March before automatic cuts known as sequestration took effect. The Pentagon faces a tight squeeze even as it avoids what would have been another $20 billion wave of automatic cuts. The Pentagonís core budget is basically frozen at $487 billion after most accounts absorbed an 8 percent automatic cut last year. Adding $6 billion to Obamaís war request provides some relief to readiness accounts, however, though active duty troop levels would still be cut by 40,000, to 1.36 million. It includes $85 billion for overseas military operations, a slight cut from last year. Domestic programs generally fare better and are kept, on average, at levels agreed to last year before the automatic cuts of 5 percent kicked in across the board. Those broadly applied cuts, or sequestration, were triggered by Washingtonís inability to follow up a 2011 budget deal with additional deficit savings. NASA, the FBI and the Border Patrol all won spending increases at the expense of cuts to the Transportation Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service and foreign aid. Thereís money to repair the iconic cast iron dome of the U.S. Capitol, full funding for food aid for low-income pregnant women and their children, and a $150 million increase over 2013 for high-priority transportation infrastructure projects. The bill fills out the budget agreement sealed last month by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the heads of the House and Senate Budget Committees. Murray and Ryan left it to the chairmen of Congressí appropriations committees, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., to work out the details. The measure changes a Ryan-Murray provision cutting military pension cost-of-living increases for working age retirees to exempt disabled veterans and surviving spouses from the cut. The lowest-common-denominator bill doesnít contain big-ticket wins for either side, but the simple fact that a deal came together was seen as a win for Congress as an institution and its band of 81 appropriators. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, strongly pushed for a deal, even though the end product was a six-inch-high ìomnibusî compilation of what was supposed to be a dozen separate spending bills. Presidents and lawmakers alike deride such measures. Boehner (center) returns to his office after a vote on the House floor to approve a spending bill on Jan. 15. The House overwhelmingly approved a $1.1 trillion spending bill that quashes the threat of a government shutdown through Sept. 30 and offers lawmakers a chance to end four years of chaotic, crisis-driven budgeting. Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst. The alternatives, however, were to allow automatic spending cuts to strike for a second year and risk another politically debilitating government shutdown. Democrats celebrated winning an addition $1 billion over last year for the Head Start early childhood education program and excluding from the bill a host of conservative policy ìridersî advanced by the GOP. ìWe were able to strip out nearly all the new, divisive riders relating to abortion, contraception, gun control, immigration, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, environmental protection,î said Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ìThis is very important to Democrats.î Some Democrats said they would support it but only reluctantly, complaining that despite some increases, spending for education, health and other programs would still be too low. ìWith this bill, we are waist deep in manure instead of neck deep in manure. Hooray, I guess,î Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said. Republicans successfully ìzeroed outî funding for high-speed rail, a slap at California Democrats, and they were able to keep tight limits on the implementation of ìObamacareî and the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulations. Conservatives complained that the bill keeps the money flowing to wasteful programs, but the actual debate was a sleepy affair dominated by the old-school lawmakers who populate the Appropriations Committee. ìWhatís this money going for?î said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. ìIt continues funding for the scandalous Essential Air Service that pays to fly empty and near empty planes across the country. It continues to throw money at all manner of immensely expensive and failed green energy programs and other forms of corporate welfare.î The much-criticized Essential Air Service, which subsidizes airlines serving smaller rural airports and enjoys support from many conservatives whose districts benefit from its largess, would receive a record budget of $249 million. House-proposed reforms to limit per-ticket subsidies to no more than $500 were stripped out of the measure, preserving service to the average three people a day flying out of Great Bend, Kansas, and the two people who fly out of Glendive, Mont., per day.","ëHooray, I guessí ó House passes $1.1 trillion spending bill  | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/hooray-i-guess-house-passes-1-1-trillion-spending-bill/
27,"Foreclosures hit six-year low in 2013. In Miami, one out of every 25 homes had a foreclosure filing last year, according to RealtyTrac. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Last year was a banner year in the fight against foreclosures, with filings hitting their lowest level since 2007. Total foreclosure filings for 2013, including notices of default, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions, were reported on 1.36 million properties, down 26% from 2012, according to RealtyTrac. With one in every 96 homes reporting at least one foreclosure filing in 2013, the national foreclosure rate has dropped to 1.04% -- close to the historic norm of just below 1%. During the 2010 peak of the housing crisis, the national foreclosure rate was 2.23%. Despite the improving market , the foreclosure threat continues to hang over the heads of many homeowners. In December, 9.3 million properties, or 19% of all homes, were reported to be "" deeply underwater ,"" meaning borrowers owed at least 25% more on their mortgage than the homes was worth. ""Millions of homeowners are still living in the shadow of the massive foreclosure crisis"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. ""But the shadow cast by the foreclosure crisis is shrinking as fewer distressed properties enter foreclosure and properties already in foreclosure are poised to exit in greater numbers in 2014."" About 463,000 people lost their homes to bank repossessions in 2013, down 31% from 2012. In 2010, there were more than a million repossessions and 2.9 million foreclosure filings. While most of the distressed properties from the bleak years have already been taken back by lenders and resold, the banks are pushing to get the remaining backlog of foreclosures through the system. And it's coming at a good time as home prices rebound . ""There is unprecedented demand from institutional investors willing to pay with cash to buy at the foreclosure auction, helping to raise the value of properties with a foreclosure filing in 2013 by an average of 10% nationwide,"" said Blomquist. In so-called judicial foreclosure states, where foreclosures must get approved through the courts, hefty backlogs of foreclosures are just now getting worked through. Maryland, for example, saw a 107% increase in scheduled judicial foreclosure auctions in 2013. Meanwhile, New Jersey and Connecticut saw increases of 64% and 55%, respectively. Overall, Florida was the foreclosure capital last year with 270,000 properties, or more than 3% of all housing units, with at least one foreclosure filing last year. That's nearly twice as many as second place California. ""Eight of the top foreclosure cities are in Florida,"" said Blomquist. ""We used to say that about California, but now California doesn't have any cities in the top 10."" Miami had 96,710 properties in foreclosure, one in every 25 homes. That was the highest rate of any metro area and was 44% higher than in 2011. Other Florida cities where foreclosure activity was high, included Jacksonville and Orlando. Beyond Florida, metro areas making the top 10 foreclosure hotspots included Rockford, Ill. and Las Vegas.","Foreclosures hit six-year low in 2013 - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/real_estate/foreclosure-crisis/index.html
28,"Pakistan's embattled former military dictator Pervez Musharraf has refused to leave the country on ""medical grounds"" until he is given ""clean chit"" in high treason and other cases, according to a close aide. (Reuters) Summary. Former dictator Musharraf is being tried for high treason for announcing Emergency in 2007. Pakistanís embattled former military dictator Pervez Musharraf has refused to leave the country on ìmedical groundsî until he is given ìclean chitî in high treason and other cases, according to a close aide. Contrary to the impression that ìMusharrafís illness dramaî has been staged to prepare a ground to send him abroad under a deal, his friends suggest that all efforts to ìpersuadeî him to leave the country have failed to bear fruit as the Nawaz Sharif-led government wants to î get ridî of 70-year-old Musharraf as early as possible. ìMusharraf is more keen to get his name cleared in high treason and other cases rather than leaving the country on medical grounds,î said former deputy prime minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi who is considered close to the former president. Elahi and his party ñ PML-Q ñ remained a partner with Musharraf during 2002-07. It has recently put its weight behind Musharraf and launched an offensive against the PML-N government for ëonlyí trying him under treason charges for imposing emergency in the country. ìGen Musharraf sees treason and other cases politically motivated and based on personal vendetta. He wants to face them and get his name honourably cleared,î he said. There have been unconfirmed reports that Musharraf may leave Pakistan this month on ëmedical groundsí after a deal with the PML-N brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United States. But Elahi says Musharraf has no such plan. ìMusharraf is simply not interested in leaving the country on medical grounds,î he made it clear. Musharraf has been under treatment at the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC) in Rawalpindi since January 2 after he suffered from triple-vessel coronary artery disease and some other ënot seriousí diseases. Musharrafís aide has cautioned the PML-N about the consequences of trying the former army chief. ìThere will be uncontrollable fallout if the Musharrafís trial continues. The PML-Q leadership has also moved a bill in the Senate seeking to replace the word ëhigh treasoní in Article 6 of the Constitution with ëoffence against stateí. We have contacted the opposition in the Senate for the support of our bill. We wonder as how the word ëtraitorí can be used for the head of the Pakistan Army. This word should be replaced forthwith as it has demoralising effect on our army officers and jawans who are deployed at the Siachen and Indian border,î he said. Meanwhile, a lawyer for Musharraf said his client has been advised to go to the US for medical treatment. Anwar Mansoor Khan said he had submitted a letter to the court on Thursday, asking that Musharraf be transferred to the Paris Regional Medical Center in Paris, Texas. Musharraf is a patient at the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. He was taken there after suffering a ëheart problemí on the way to a court hearing. Musharraf returned to Pakistan in 2013 hoping for a political comeback but instead got embroiled in court cases relating to his near-decade in power.","Despite ëadviceí, Musharraf refuses to leave Pakistan on medical grounds | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/despite-advice-musharraf-refuses-to-leave-pakistan-on-medical-grounds/
29,"Catalonia votes today on whether to seek secession vote from†Spain. Thursday's vote is a milestone in years of mass protests by Catalans, who are fiercely proud of their distinct culture and language, demanding the right to decide whether they want to secede. (Reuters) Summary. The Spanish Constitution forbids regional vote for cases that affect the whole nation. Related. A European season of separatist fervor kicks off Thursday with Catalan lawmakers voting on whether to seek the right to hold a referendum on independence from Spain. The EU will be watching closely as Belgiumís Dutch speakers gear up to push for greater autonomy in May elections, and Scotland prepares to hold its own referendum on breaking away from Britain in the fall. Thursdayís vote is a milestone in years of mass protests by Catalans, who are fiercely proud of their distinct culture and language, demanding the right to decide whether they want to secede. But it is also largely a symbolic one. Catalonia can ask Spain for permission to hold an independence vote all it wants; Madrid still has the power to say ìnoî _ and it almost certainly will. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has repeatedly said he will not allow a Catalonia secession referendum because Spainís 1978 constitution doesnít envision anything but a unified Spanish state, and mandates that referendums affecting Spain must be held nationally and not regionally. He has an absolute majority in Parliament that assures he will prevail, and the main opposition Socialist party also opposes a referendum vote. Still, the Thursday vote, expected to win easily, could fan the flames of an already impassioned independence drive, especially if it garners the two-thirds majority that supporters are hoping for. A strong separatist message may also inspire independence movements elsewhere in the European Union at a time when European unity has been rocked by economic crisis. In Spain, the momentum generated by this weekís events will put wealthy Catalonia ìinto a head-on collision with the Madrid government,î predicted Hugh OíDonnell, professor of cultural politics at Glasgow Caledonian University. ìI think the political temperature in Spain is going to increase very significantly.î Even if Madrid refuses to allow an independence vote, Catalan politicians might decide to try to hold a referendum anyway. That would put them in perilous legal terrain: When the northern Basque region, where separatist sentiment has also raged, failed to obtain permission for a similar referendum in 2005, Spain said Basque leaders could face jail time if they went ahead and held the vote anyway. A less extreme scenario would be to use Catalan regional elections as a kind of unofficial referendum, with parties obliged to clearly state where they stand on independence. Under such a situation, any vote for a pro-independence party would be taken as a de facto vote for independence. A big ìyesî turnout would give further ammunition to independence supporters to push for a referendum, with or without Spainís approval. Even though Catalans know the chance of getting Madrid to let them hold a referendum is virtually nil, they still headed to the streets in Barcelona last weekend, holding noisy protests while waving flags bearing red-and-yellow stripes, a blue triangle and white star symbolizing Cataloniaís independence drive. Gemma Mondon, a real estate agency administrator from Barcelona, became convinced as Spainís financial crisis deepened after the 2008 global economic meltdown that Catalonia should strive for independence. She was planning to buy a new independence flag to show her support for a referendum by hanging it from a window in her apartment, replacing the faded one she first put up two years ago. ìIn Scotland they are doing the vote and the English government is saying yes. I donít understand why they are so afraid for us to say out loud what we want,î said Mondon. ìWe donít know what the answer is and I think people should have the right to decide.î The secession question isnít so easy for Monica Casares, an unemployed events organizer from the Catalan city of Badalona, who wants to be able to vote in a referendum but worries about whether her small children would be better off in an independent Catalonia or as Spanish citizens. ìMy husband is `yesí without a doubt and I am closer to `yesí than `noí but itís a very difficult decision for me,î said Casares. ìMany of my friends are for `yes,í some of my family are `no,í and Iím in the middle.î Polls show Catalans overwhelmingly support the right to hold an independence referendum and are roughly evenly split on independence _ but that figure drops significantly when people are asked if they favor an independent Catalonia outside the European Union. The European Union and NATO have warned Catalonia it would be excluded if it seceded and would have to reapply for membership. Catalonia has had a long history of separatist sentiment, especially since its own language and cultural traditions were harshly repressed by General Francisco Francoís military dictatorship from the end of Spainís Civil War in 1939 until his death in 1975. Despite sharing cultural traits with the rest of Spain, many Catalans take pride in deep differences based on their language, spoken side-by-side with Spanish in the area that has a 23 percent unemployment rate compared to Spainís national rate of 26 percent. And separatists make their views known at home games for the famed Barcelona soccer team, chanting in Catalan for independence and waving their flags. Artur Mas, the regional president of Catalonia, began pushing for the referendum after he failed to clinch a better financial pact for Catalonia with the central government in 2012 following a massive demonstration across Catalonia a year earlier in favor of a secession vote that energized independence supporters. Catalonia is one of the countryís most powerful regions and represents roughly a fifth of Spainís 1.1 trillion euro ($1.5 trillion) GDP. Its population of 7.5 million is greater than those of EU members such as Denmark, Ireland or Finland. Other Spaniards are keenly aware of the blow Catalan independence would inflict to a nation already struggling with economic devastation. In Madrid, Jesusa Pollan said it would be unfair to Spaniards to let the Catalans alone vote on their own future. ìEither we all vote, just like the Constitution says, and we do whatever we all decide,î said Pollan, ìor they have no right at all to vote on their own.î",Catalonia votes today on whether to seek secession vote from Spain | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/catalonia-votes-today-on-whether-to-seek-secession-vote-from-spain/
30,"Summary. Related. Hindu groups in South Africa have expressed outrage at photographs taken at a music festival which depict models in provocative positions, posing with t-shirts featuring various Hindu deities. The photographs posted on a website showed several models stretching out their hands pretending to be a six-limbed deity. Another picture showed a model lifting her t-shirt as she stands against paintings of Hindu deities. The pictures were taken at a music festival during New Year festivities. The National community leaders have unanimously condemned these actions, but the photographer defended saying it was within the rights to freedom of expression. South African Tamil Federation President Karthi Moothsamy said his organisation would pursue the matter with both the ruling African National Congress and government institutions. ìWhile it is so that freedom of expression is embodied in the South African Constitution, the same Constitution does not grant absolute rights in this regard,î Moothsamy said. ìWe will call on government to introduce legislation that protects Hindu and other religious iconography from being denigrated.î South African Hindu Maha Sabha president Ashwin Trikamjee said these type of action reared its head from time to time, usually from people who were ignorant of its religious significance. ìWe have to find a way to address the increasing use of Hindu iconography in a derogatory way with impunity,î he said. Hindu Youth Network Chairman Pregesan Pillay said the latest incident was particularly offencive as it came while temples across the country marked Thaipoosam Kavady, honouring the deity Ganesha, one of those featuring in the offencive pictures. The editor of the website, who identified himself as Nas Who, said the photographs were not aimed at making any statement on Hinduism. The images were used as it was already on display at the festival as a backdrop for a project. Who told the weekly Post that he would have to consult with his staff before taking a decision on removing the photos from the website. But the artistic director of the photo shoot, Lucia Gcingca, was opposed to this. ìI strongly believe in the freedom of expression and what we did was to express our artistic freedom. We used the pictures because they looked good. They had no political meaning,î she said.

""M&A Game"" is said by its developer, the international data firm ansarada, to be the world's first mergers-and-acquisitions (M&A) game app. It aims to create all the thrills and cutthroat competition of a real takeover bid. ""M&A is usually a long and intensive process involving months of detailed work by everyone working on deals,"" Sam Riley, CEO of ansarada, said in a news release. ""We decided to design and build a game to provide some escapist fun for the whole M&A community, anywhere in the world."" Players can buy, sell and merge corporations across nine major industrial sectors with a team of investment bankers, accountants and lawyers. Deal-making tactics range all the way from flattery to haggling and bullying. ""We created it to be a fun escape, but also very competitive because people involved in M&A are pretty competitive by their nature,"" a spokesperson for ansarada said. Players are asked to select from a range of qualities and attributes they think make a good M&A deal maker, including drive, charisma, strength, and even deception. The catch? You can't have all the qualities, so a savvy CEO will know which to prioritise. Does the app herald a rebound for the largely dormant M&A sector? European M&A was down nearly a quarter on last year to $511 billion but, with firms sitting on piles of excess cash, investors are now pushing them to snap up rivals. ""The corporate cut and thrust is certainly very much front and centre in the business world now,"" the spokesperson said. ""It's very much back on the agenda.""",Wolves of Wall Street can sharpen M&A teeth on new game app - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/wolves-of-wall-street-can-sharpen-ma-teeth-on-new-game-app/articleshow/28909587.cms
32,"Picking ETFs that try to beat the market. ""There's a place for active and passive investments,"" says Amy Schioldager, head of beta strategies at BlackRock. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) The fund industry writ large follows what's hot. And nothing is hotter now than trying to outsmart the market with an index fund. Look at buzzwords in the world of ETFs , which are nearly all index funds. From ""fundamental"" to ""smart beta"" to ""dynamic,"" they all point to the notion that there's a more clever way to index. Fundamental funds have been around since 2005. Their designers say there's a flaw in standard indexes: The greater a company's total market value, the bigger place it holds in an index. So when investors go gaga over Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and drive up its price, an index fund must own more of it. Fundamental funds rank companies by other measures, such as sales and dividends. As a result, they lean, like Dimensional , toward value. But their creators argue that this may be more than compensation for risk. Rather, there's a chance to take advantage of behavioral biases, underweighting stocks the crowd loves too much. ""If you're contrarian, in the long run you can do better,"" says Jason Hsu of Research Affiliates, which built the index behind the $2.6 billion Power-Shares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000 ETF ( PRF ) . The competition to create new indexes is getting stiffer. Among the entrants is BlackRock, a $4 trillion money manager that runs 7,000 different investment strategies. You may know the company better for its iShares brand of ETFs. BlackRock has since late 2011 launched 10 iShares funds offering some kind of enhanced index, and investors have poured in nearly $8 billion. BlackRock's biggest unit has roots (via acquisitions) in a company that in 1971 created the first indexed account for a pension fund. David Booth (LINK TK) worked on that fund. Two of BlackRock's new ETFs tilt based on the same small and value effects Dimensional goes after. But if Dimensional is akin to elegant, cultish Apple, iShares are like open-source Android. Since ETFs trade like stocks, they are available to anyone with a brokerage account, to combine in any way. ""There's a place for active and passive strategies,"" says Amy Schioldager, 51, BlackRock's head of beta strategies. (""Beta"" is finance-speak for capturing the market's return.) BlackRock has found particular success with iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ( USMV ) . It's built on research arguing that staid stocks, such as utilities with hefty dividends, may in the long run match or beat market returns without as much pain along the way. (A hypothetical version of the index the ETF follows would have earned 8.2% annualized over 10 years, vs. 7.2% for the S&P 500.) So-called low-volatility funds have had enormous appeal since the financial crisis. ""This is a great strategy for someone who's been a heavy bond user,"" says Schioldager, who adds that BlackRock launched the strategy at the request of institutional clients. At a time of measly bond yields, investors want other ways to capture income or reduce volatility. What to expect in the stock market in 2014. Some market watchers think low-vol stocks may be about to run out of steam. Money has poured into the space -- not just via indexers but from active funds too -- driving up valuations. ""It's always worrisome when a product becomes the darling of investors,"" says Morningstar analyst Samuel Lee. Will the low-vol investors stick around when performance fades? BlackRock says the company keeps funds open even when strategies go out of style. Schioldager says it isn't necessarily BlackRock's job to take sides in philosophical debates about investment strategies. The company aims to create cheap, well-designed tools. (Minimum Volatility charges 0.15%.) ""We offer building blocks,"" says Schioldager. The takeaway for you. As indexish strategies proliferate and advisers push the latest, greatest ways to do better, figuring out which theories hold water could be daunting. Getting this precisely right may not matter. Research Affiliates tabulated results for approaches including value tilt, a version of low volatility, holding stocks in equal proportions, and even monkeys throwing darts at the stock pages. Every one, (simulated) monkeys included, beat the market. Why? Almost any strategy other than ranking stocks by market value, as normal indexes do, tilts to small, value, or both, said RA. The upshot: Many of these funds may lag together when blue-chip growth stocks lead, and you shouldn't pay up just because a new index sounds sophisticated. If you buy an ETF with a twist, stick to the cheaper options.

33,"The dynamic 48-year-old Swede fits the bill as a media-savvy technology fanatic, but his emergence as a leading candidate for the US company will still come as a surprise to many on Wall Street. Vestberg, a former elite-level handball player, worked his way through the ranks at the world's largest mobile telecoms equipment maker, with stints in China, Brazil, Mexico and the United States en route to becoming chief financial officer before taking the top job in 2010. But he has struggled to convince investors that Ericsson can maintain its lead in mobile networks in the face of stiff competition from rivals such as China's Huawei. Since Vestberg took the helm, the company's shares have underperformed the sector. Though the share price has risen 19 per cent, in line with Microsoft, that compares with a leap of nearly 60 per cent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index. over the same period and a 41 per cent rise for Sweden's blue-chip index. Both Microsoft and Ericsson declined to comment on Bloomberg's report, though a source close to the US company has said that no CEO appointment is likely until the last week of January at the earliest. Furthermore, Microsoft might prefer a candidate with more experience in consumer products as it tries to take the fight to market leaders Apple and Samsung in handsets and tablets after its purchase of Nokia's mobile phone business. Vestberg was in charge of Ericsson's exit from its handset joint venture with Sony two years ago, ending the company's association with consumer products. ""I don't think it's very likely that they will choose Vestberg,"" said Bengt Nordstrom, head of Swedish telecoms consultancy Northstream. ""It's more logical that they will find a US leader, from their network of owners, board members and experienced CEOs with a software, enterprise and media background.

But speculation refocused on internal choices this month after the leading external candidate, Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally , took himself off the list. Sources familiar with the company have told Reuters that, with Mulally out of the running, the list of candidates able to run a globe-spanning software corporation struggling to expand into the mobile software and devices markets is thin. Analysts say that Microsoft may have to look at ""dark horse"" candidates, but noted that some widely touted executives in the technology sector, including Pivotal Inc CEO Paul Maritz , have already declined to take the job.

34,"SAN FRANCISCO: Yahoo's No. 2 executive, Henrique de Castro, has been fired by his boss, Marissa Mayer , a little more than a year after she wooed him away from Google to help her turn around the struggling Internet company. Yahoo, which has lost ground in recent years to competitors like Google and Facebook, announced de Castro's departure in a terse, two-sentence document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the stock market closed Wednesday. There was none of the usual corporate boilerplate that typically sugarcoats such departures - no praise for his service from Yahoo's chief executive, Mayer, no mention of a sudden interest that de Castro had taken in spending more time with his family. A Yahoo spokeswoman said the company had no further comment on the matter. But Mayer, who left Google to become Yahoo's chief executive in mid-2012, was clearly displeased with de Castro's performance. In a memo announcing the leadership reorganization to Yahoo's staff, she wrote, ""I made the difficult decision that our COO, Henrique de Castro, should leave the company. I appreciate Henrique's contributions and wish him the best in his future endeavors."" ""Overall, I'm confident that the leadership team, our direction, and these changes will enable even more successful execution,"" she wrote near the end of the memo, which was first published by the technology news site ReCode. Over the past year, Yahoo lost its position as the No. 2 digital ad seller in the United States to Facebook, according to the research firm eMarketer. Yahoo had just 5.8 per cent of the market, compared to 7.4 per cent for Facebook and 39.9 per cent for Google. The company posted similar declines overseas. Clark Fredricksen , a vice president at eMarketer, said that Yahoo had so far failed to transition its advertising from the desktop to mobile, which has contributed to the declines. But he said the company had been laying the groundwork for a possible turnaround. ""They are streamlining the experience for advertisers, which is positive,"" Fredricksen said. ""They are improving the quality of the ad experience for users. They are making investments that will help grow their user base and ad revenues."" De Castro will not be around to see if those efforts bear fruit. But he will be walking away with a substantial severance package. The final amount has not yet been determined and will hinge in part on how well he did in reaching performance targets set for 2013. In his October 2012 offer letter, he was promised stock-related compensation with a target value of $56 million, vesting over four years, as well as unspecified severance benefits. Although he will not be entitled to receive all of that money since he left before the end of four years, he will receive a large portion of it.",Yahoo's Marissa Mayer fires COO more than a year after she wooed him away from Google - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/yahoos-marissa-mayer-fires-coo-more-than-a-year-after-she-wooed-him-away-from-google/articleshow/28879515.cms
35,"NEW DELHI: The American Embassy School, located within the US embassy compound in New Delhi, is under the scanner for alleged violation of India's tax and visa laws - a fallout of the reciprocal measures taken by New Delhi to pare down the privileges of US diplomats in India over the Devyani Khobragade episode. As the US and India continue with business as usual in the aftermath of the fracas over the handcuffing and strip-search of Indian diplomat Khobragade, reports said several American teachers, who are spouses of US diplomats, work at the American school without legal work permits in violation of Indian laws. A New York Times report Thursday said the school has issued a handout to staffers saying that women teachers whose husbands would be teaching at the school should not reveal that they will be teaching too. ""The female spouse should not state that she will be working,"" the handout stated, instructing spouses to list their occupation on visa applications as ""housewife"", adding that ""no sexism is intended on our part"", according to the NYT report. Khobragade, then India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested Dec 12 for alleged visa fraud - charges she has denied. In a reciprocal move, India withdrew several diplomatic privileges from US diplomats including airport passes and diplomatic ID cards and also asked to be informed about the number of teachers working in American schools in India and their salaries. India has also asked that salaries that the US embassy and consulates pay their Indian staff be conveyed. The American Embassy School handout ""notes that India has placed restrictions on the number of tax-free visas available to school employees"". ""So, if you are a teaching couple,"" the handout says, ""we usually have the male spouse apply for the 'employment' visa and the female spouse be noted as 'housewife' on the visa application,"" the NYT said. India's external affairs ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said: ""We are aware of these reports. These are serious issues relating to visa and tax matters. We will examine them very carefully."" The Khobragade incident led to a nasty stand-off between the US and India. However, after she returned to India last week both sides have attempted to return to business as usual. On Tuesday, US Deputy Secretary of State William Burns hosted a ""productive"" lunch meeting with Indian Ambassador S. Jaishankar and both sides affirmed the importance of the US-India strategic partnership. The fact that spouses of some American diplomats were working as teachers in the school was well known. It had been going on for many years as part of the ""wink and nod"" agreement between the two sides. In the same manner, Khobragade was allowed to take her domestic help Sangeeta Richard along with her by agreeing to pay the US equivalent salary to her, which Indians cannot afford, said a source. The US is keen to put aside the Khobragade incident and move ahead with its bilateral ties with India - built steadily over the years, said a source, adding that the Burns-Jaishankar meeting was a firm statement of its intent.","Devyani Khobragade case: American School under scanner for violation of visa, tax laws - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/devyani-khobragade-case-american-school-under-scanner-for-violation-of-visa-tax-laws/articleshow/28904735.cms
36,"NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi will not be Congress party's nominee for Prime Ministership in the April-May Lok Sabha polls but will lead the election campaign, the party announced today putting at rest all speculation about his role. The decision was taken at the two-hour meeting of the extended Congress Working Committee brushing aside an overwhelming demand for anointing him the PM nominee ahead of the polls. Addressing those who voiced the clamour for declaration of Rahul as PM candidate, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said there is no tradition in the party to declare a PM candidate before polls. The demand for Rahul to be made PM candidate was raised by Kerala PCC chief Ramesh Chennithala and got instant support from a host of leaders including B K Hari Prasad, Gurudas Kamat, Ghulam Nabi Azad and youth Congress chief Rajiv Satav . Soon after the CWC meeting began, Chennithala made a strong pitch to declare Rahul Gandhi as PM candidate saying ""time has now come to do it"" and reasoned this will enthuse the youth and will be beneficial for Congress in the changed demographic scenario. As the leaders made a common chorus to name Rahul as PM pick, Sonia Gandhi intervened saying why should the party name a PM candidate before polls when there is no such precedent. ""This meeting of the AICC delcares that 2014 election campaign will be led by Rahul Gandhi,"" the CWC decided adding the line in the omnibus draft resolution which will come before the AICC meeting tomorrow for approval. Rahul has been entrusted to lead the campaign a year after he was made the party Vice President in the brain storming session at Jaipur in January last. Taking a dig at BJP, which has declared Narendra Modi as its PM candidate, party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said that in Congress the question of making anyone the PM candidate never arose starting from the era of Jawaharlal Nehru to the 2004 elections, which the party fought under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi. ""It is always clear who is the leader in Congress. It is never an issue for us,"" he said adding it is an issue for those parties which have seen intense rivlary and dissension over Prime Ministerial candidate. Reacting to the CWC decision, Rahul Gandhi said he is a dedicated worker of the party and would carry out whatever responsibility given by the organization. Dwivedi sought to dismiss the perception that Congress was shying away from declaring its PM candidate due to apprehensions of a poor show in the next polls at a time when Modi-led BJP appears to have an advantage.","Rahul Gandhi not to be anointed PM candidate, to lead party campaign - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rahul-gandhi-not-to-be-anointed-pm-candidate-to-lead-party-campaign/articleshow/28901727.cms

38,"So what did do we make of A-Rodís comments? Seems to me like he has entered the seventh and final stage of grief : Acceptance and Hope. This is yet another classic A-Rod episode, of course. He offers eyebrow-raising remarks, the story breaks overnight, and it requires translations both literal (Spanish to English) and spiritual (A-Rod-ish to English). I believe A-Rod will see through his three lawsuits ó one against MLB for tortious interference, one against Yankees team doctor Christopher Ahmad for medical malpractice and the latest one against MLB and the Players Association to vacate his 162-game suspension, if youíve lost track ó but I donít think the first and third will last much longer. Common sense says neither will make it to an actual trial. Maybe just a trickle of common sense is seeping through A-Rodís wall of anger and bargaining (stage three). Maybe heís realizing that if he actually wants to play baseball again, he should lighten up the rhetoric. Getting back to common sense, the only way A-Rod ever figures to play in MLB again is if the Yankees decide they would rather give him yet another chance than eat the $61 million theyíll owe him for 2015-2017. Shoot, Hal Steinbrenner called A-Rod an ìassetî Wednesday, so anythingís possible. Anythingís possible always with A-Rod, so thatís why you donít want to draw too many conclusions from anything he says or does.

39,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. ó The matchups from the quarterbacks to the coaches will be discussed ad nauseam in the coming days, and opinions will vary on what strategies should be used. But beyond the Xís and Oís, the fundamental truth about Sundayís NFC Championship is the 49ers donít like the Seahawks and arenít afraid to admit it. ìThereís no question thereís a lot of hostility between us,î said mild-mannered linebacker Patrick Willis. ìTheyíre an opponent and we want to win.î On paper, the Niners (14-4) versus the Seahawks (14-3) is about as good as it can get in the NFC. Theyíre the two best teams in the conference, playing their best football. The fact they genuinely canít stand each other only adds to the hype. When asked on Wednesday if the dislike between the two NFC West rivals was real, wide receiver Anquan Boldin didnít hesitate: ìI think so,î he said. ìIt will always be that way when you have two teams in the same division. You play each other two times a year and, if youíre good enough, possibly three times a year. Itís the same way when I was in Baltimore playing against Pittsburgh. You respect each other as foes, but thereís a real dislike.î The two teams split their regular-season meetings, but what has the 49ers angry is the Seahawks have beaten them by a combined score of 71-16 in the last two games played in Seattle. That includes a 29-3 Seahawks win on Sept. 15 at CentruyLink Field. Niners quarterback Colin Kaepernick had three interceptions and a lost fumble in September, but insists the two previous games in Seattle, ìreally donít matter at this point. Weíre trying this game so we can get to where we want to be.î Itís understandable why the Niners and Seahawks donít exchange Christmas cards. San Francisco is making its third straight trip to the NFC title game and isnít used to being embarrassed, which is what happened when the Niners were beaten 42-13 in December 2012 before getting whipped again last September. Not only did they have to put up with the crowd noise generated by the very vocal Seahawks fans, but they had to listen to the chatter coming from the players. Boldin, for one, isnít about to back down. ìIf you want to talk and do a lot of that, feel free. But at the end of the day you have to play football,î Boldin said. ìYou can do all the talk and the rah-rah you want. But when all that emotion wears off, youíre still playing football. Thatís when the real men show up.î This may be the NFLís best current example of familiarity breeds contempt. The overall series between the two teams if 15-15 with the Seahawks winning four of the last five games in Seattle. This is their first postseason matchup, though you get the feeling theyíd be willing to play this on a sandlot with nobody around. ìThis is only for the tough,î Niners coach Jim Harbaugh said, ìthis kind of game, this point in the season. Our guys are very happy about that. Theyíre very excited and very much looking forward to this being a lot of fun. I would trade to be able to compete as a player in this game. Itís pretty significant.î The Niners beat the Seahawks, 19-17, Dec. 8 in San Francisco. Itís part of an eight-game winning streak that has infused them with confidence. Unlike other teams that might not be familiar with the intimidating atmosphere in Seattle, the Niners know what to expect. ìIíd be kidding myself if I said the crowd wasnít loud,î Willis said. ìBut at the end of the day it doesnít matter. We have to play to the best of our ability. If we do that and God forbid we lose and we play our best football, then maybe it wasnít meant to be. But at the end of the day itís all about getting that W. We want to go out there and play our best football.

Thereís a famous movie called ìRear Window.î Now thereís an infamous play that should be titled ìRear Entry.î Based on Toni Bentleyís ìerotic memoir,î the new solo ìThe Surrenderî details its authorís discovery and embrace of anal sex. Rammed with prose as purple as it is explicit, the show, which Bentley adapted herself, is a laughable ego trip. To hear her tell it, youíd think this straight lady had invented butt sex. The 2004 best seller detailed Bentleyís journey from ìwretched emotional submission to my blessed sexual submission.î She and ìA-Man,î as she called her main lover, went through the mass-market back door long before Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey even looked at the buzzer. The show is a monologue, so, sadly, thereís no A-Man here ó he might have helped break the monotony. A former New York City Ballet dancer, Bentley was in her early 40s when her book came out. Here, the narrator, played by Laura Campbell, looks to be in her mid-20s. Itís a key change: Weíre watching a young woman excitedly recount and even brag about her sexual exploits, instead of hearing a mature one reflect on a transformative experience. Itís hard not to daydream about what a more experienced actress could have done with the material. But then, not even Judi Dench (now thereís a thought!) could salvage howlers like ìI met this man in a foreign land called Bliss,î ìThe impossible had come to pass in my a<U+200A>-<U+200A>-,î and ìHe shattered the control panel of my being.î And when Bentley recalls a man invading her ìvertical mail slot,î itís no metaphor ó they literally have sex through an opening usually reserved for the US Postal Service. As if this all werenít obvious enough, director Zishan Ugurlu has poor Campbell, clad in a short silk robe and a corset, writhe seductively on a chaise lounge. The single most interesting aspect of the show is its unintentional portrait of Bentley as an OCD case. She records all her sexual encounters in notebooks (reaching 298 with A-Man alone), grooms obsessively before every session, and keeps her used condoms and crusty K-Y leftovers. (That last bit didnít make it from the book to the stage.) But that may have been a bit too disturbing for this rah-rah ode to self-empowerment.

But the likely outcome may leave Christie looking ridiculous ó and a man who wants to be president ìcanít afford to be made to look ridiculous.î Those who hope to make political hay with the lane closures think it plays into his image as a ìbully.î Others seem to think it will do damage to his reputation as a no-nonsense plain-speaker and truth-teller, or that it suggests heís an incompetent who doesnít know what his aides are doing. Not at all. In fact, the early polls in New Jersey suggest it hasnít hurt him very much, and thatís with the wall-to-wall, 24-7 coverage it has garnered everywhere. After all, this is the very definition of a petty scandal, and it looks pettier and odder every day. Someone decided to close lanes and make traffic, and to cover up that fact with a ìstudy.î It was an awful thing to do, but the sheer peculiarity of the scheme ó no matter what the reason ó makes it essentially comic in the retelling. Thatís good for Christie in one way, because his enemies in New Jersey and the Democratic Party (and some on the right in the GOP) are already in danger of overplaying their hands and treating this clown show as though it were Watergate. But itís bad for Christie in another way. The pettiness of the lane closures threatens to turn him from a formidable presence into an object of ridicule. On Tuesday night, Jimmy Fallon teamed with Bruce Springsteen on an immensely clever ìBorn to Runî takeoff that will probably have 50 million YouTube hits by the time the 2016 election rolls around. ìThey shut down the tollbooths of glory ícause we didnít endorse Chris Christie,î Fallon sang, while Springsteen complained he needed to go to the bathroom but couldnít because he was caught up in ìGovernor Chris Christieís Fort Lee, New Jersey, Traffic Jam.î Yes, Springsteen is a leftist, and yes, this is a classic mainstream-media hit on a Republican. But to use a term beloved to Internet marketers, the idea behind the video is ìsticky.î It will persist. Christie will forever be associated not only with the inconvenience an invented traffic jam caused but with the cockamamie scheme executed on his behalf ó punishing someone through the ludicrous conceit of making gridlock happen. Among the consequences of this ludicrous conceit: Bruce Springsteen shouting, repeatedly, ìI have to take a leakî on national TV. Christie and Sarah Palin have very little in common, to put it mildly, but the moment in 2008 that Palin became the gleeful object of belittling late-night satire, she went from being a raw political talent Democrats deeply feared to a comic wellspring from which they drank deeply. Up till now, Christieís main liability as a pop-culture figure has been his weight. Heís working on that, and impressively so. Thatís hard work.

42,"The Mann of the hour beat Tom Brady Wednesday. Peyton Manning practiced with his team, and Brady was too ill to practice with his team. Now all Manning has to do is beat him Sunday, and heís back in the Super Bowl. Except all this Manning-Brady Legacy Game talk overlooks the one man who has stood in Manningís way from the moment he entered the league 15 years ago, the one man Brady never had plotting against him. The one man who has made Manning more sick than anyone who stood between him and the Lombardi Trophy. A man who, if Brady is at anything less than 100 percent on Sunday, will have his back with a defense prepared to confuse and fluster Manning more than any other. A defense that will believe it can do the job against Peyton Manning. And such is Manningís respect for this man that if you listened to him Wednesday, you would have thought Manning and the Broncos were trying to claim the Bill Belichick Trophy, not the Lombardi Trophy. ìCoach Belichick is the best coach that Iíve ever competed against,î Manning said, ìand I think itís safe to say heíll go down as the greatest NFL coach of all time. ìAnd so, the teams that he has coached, that Iíve competed against, have always been well-coached, always been prepared, have always played hard for 60 minutes. ìIf I had to think of a couple of things that stood out about the teams that heís coached ó I played against him when he was a defensive coordinator with the Jets, and then when he was the head coach in New England ó those things jump out every single week, and to me, that speaks to his coaching.î In 1998, when Belichick was Bill Parcellsí defensive coordinator with the Jets, Manning threw two interceptions in a 44-6 blowout loss in the third game of his rookie season. Two years later, in Belichickís first year with the Patriots, Manning threw three interceptions in a 24-16 loss. In 2001, three more interceptions in a 44-13 rout. Manning really didnít break through against Belichick until the 2006 AFC Championship victory. In the playoffs, Manning is 1-2 against Belichick, with two touchdowns and six interceptions. For Manning, this would be the sweetest of Peybacks for the torment of his youth ó and beyond. Manning was asked if he relished these matchups with Belichick. The Brain vs. The Genius. ìItís a great challenge when youíve played against teams coached by Bill Belichick,î Manning said. ìLike I said, always well-coached, always well-disciplined, and you know itís going to be a 60-minute fight.î Eli Manning ruined Super Bowls XLII and XLVI for Belichick. Peyback for him in a sense as well. ìHeís as good as weíre going to face, as good as we have faced,î Belichick said. ìItíll be a big challenge for us, I think our defensive football team realizes that, and weíll be out there Sunday to do our very best at defending not only him but the other 10 guys that are out there with him, and theyíre all pretty good, too.î There is no doubt in my mind Manning would have more than one Super Bowl ring had he been paired with Belichick. Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio is respected, but how often do you suspect Brady will be asked about him? ìCertainly preparation is important in games like this, and you want to have kind of laser focus,î Manning said. ìBut I guess what I would say, if you have to prepare harder for this game, that means you probably havenít been preparing hard enough all season long. And so, I really feel you have to treat every game, regular-season game, as if itís the most important game. I mean, cover yourself from a preparation standpoint, spend the time talking to your teammates about this adjustment or this audible, thatís how youíre supposed to play the game I think and prepare. But when you do that all season long, when you get to games like this, it should flow right along. Ö Our preparation had been good all season, and itíll be important that itís solid again this week.î Brady, Manning knows, will prepare for Del Rio as if he were Belichick. ìI feel like heís been a better player each year than he was the year before,î Manning said, ìand that to me speaks to his work ethic in the offseason, his refusal to be complacent or satisfied. He always feels like he can step his game up one level higher, which some of the seasons heís had, you kind of say, ëHow can he can get better than that?í but I think he has done that.î Manning was asked how big a deal Bradyís absence from practice Wednesday was. ìI really donít know the answer to that,î he said. ìI would say probably not that big of a one.î Belichick showing up sick Sunday, now that might get Peyton Manning Super healthy.","Belichick, not Brady, is Manningís nemesis | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/belichick-not-brady-is-mannings-nemesis/

44,"NEW DELHI: Taunting the Congress, BJP today said it had avoided naming Rahul Gandhi as its Prime Ministerial candidate as it was aware of an impending defeat in the Lok Sabha polls. BJP said naming of Rahul Gandhi as the Congress' Prime Ministerial nominee would have led to comparisons with Narendra Modi against whom the Congress Vice President ""stands no chance"". Party president Rajnath Singh said the Congress decision indicated that they accepted that Modi is going to be the Prime Minister .

45,"NEW DELHI: State-run oil explorers Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will buy part of the government's stake in Indian Oil Corp for a total of Rs 4,700 crore to Rs 5,000 crore, helping the government meet part of its disinvestment target in a choppy market. ""In-principle we have taken a decision for a block deal. Modalities will be worked out,"" Oil Minister Veerappa Moily told reporters after the meeting of empowered group of ministers on disinvestment. The government holds 78.9% stake in IOC. The empowered group deferred a decision to sell IOC shares to the public because they were undervalued, Oil secretary Vivek Rae said. The government chose the block deal as the finance ministry is desperate to raise money through sale of stakes in state-run firms for narrowing the budget deficit. ONGC and OIL have been told to purchase the shares, government and industry officials said. ONGC already holds 8.77% stake in IOC. Moily and IOC Chairman RS Butola had cautioned the government not to launch a public offer in a weak market because there was a sharp fall in its valuation and shares were falling further after the government announced to divest 10% of its stake in the company. Its share price has started gaining after the government shelved the public offer route, officials said. In November last year the company's scrip fell to around Rs 200 on the news of the public offering, which was down from Rs 349 on Jan 18 that year. After the news of the block deal, its shares closed 1.5% higher at Rs 212.05 in the Mumbai market on Thursday. But, the EGoM's decision has a negative impact on the companies buying IOC's shares: ONGC fell 1.5% and OIL by 0.5% at the close of the market. The 10% disinvestment in IOC has been approved by the Cabinet and is part of plans by the government to raise Rs 40,000 crore from asset sales this fiscal year. It has so far only met Rs 1,323 crore of this target through disinvestment in six state-run firms. Government and state oil companies' officials say that ONGC and OIL will get value later after the government will introduce the pricing reforms in fuel retail. Public offering would have a poor response because of the government's fuel pricing policy, which forces oil marketing companies to sell diesel below market rates, they said.","EGoM okays IOC share sale to ONGC, OIL for Rs 4,800-5,000 crore - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/market-news/egom-okays-ioc-share-sale-to-ongc-oil-for-rs-4800-5000-crore/articleshow/28893887.cms
46,"NEW YORK: Apple Inc's various objections to a court-appointed antitrust monitor in a case involving fixing e-book prices only confirm the importance of his work, a federal judge said on Thursday. ""If anything, Apple's reaction to the existence of a monitorship underscores the wisdom of its imposition,"" US District Judge Denise Cote wrote. Cote's comment came in a 64-page opinion explaining why earlier this week she had rejected Apple's request to stay an order installing an external compliance monitor, after she found Apple liable for conspiring to fix e-book prices. The judge said she would allow Apple until Tuesday to file an appeal of her decision to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals. Apple did not immediately comment on the written opinion. A lawyer for the company, Theodore Boutrous, said on Monday that Apple planned to appeal. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the government was pleased with Cote's decision. The ruling is the latest step in an escalating skirmish between Apple and the monitor, Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general. Cote appointed Bromwich in October, three months after finding Apple liable for conspiring with five publishers to hike e-book prices. In November, Apple complained that Bromwich had aggressively and improperly sought interviews with top executives and board members, a criticism that Cote rejected. ""A monitorship would be of little use at all if a monitor were only permitted to receive, review and opine on company-vetted documents,"" she wrote. ""Apple cites to no case holding that a monitor may never conduct interviews and there are many examples to the contrary."" Apple also argued that Bromwich must be disqualified because he had shown bias toward the company by filing a declaration disputing Apple's claims that he had moved too aggressively in his investigation. Cote said Bromwich had simply responded to Apple's factual allegations. Apple has also questioned Bromwich's hourly fee of $1,100, saying it gave Bromwich an incentive to drag out his investigation as long as possible. Cote said there is nothing untoward about the fee and advised Apple that there are procedures in place for it to challenge his pay before seeking a stay. She also said the Justice Department and the monitor offered to adjust his fee, but that Apple did not respond. Cote said she would assign the fee dispute to a magistrate judge for resolution. She initially denied Apple's bid after a hearing on Monday but did not offer a full explanation of her reasoning until her opinion on Thursday.

47,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel is in talks to buy out Mumbai-based Loop Mobile in a deal that will give the telecom major about 3 million customers. Loop, which owns a mobile telephony licence for the Mumbai circle, is in negotiations with Airtel and other telecom firms to sell its business in a Rs 750 crore deal. Loop Mobile has debt of Rs 400 crore, which is likely to be included in final deal size. While Loop and Airtel declined to comment, sources privy to the negotiations said Loop was in talks to sell both its mobile and tower business. Loop holds 8 megahertz of spectrum in the premium 900 MHz band, which as per latest base price, is valued at Rs 2,624 crore. The operator has about 2,000 operational mobile tower sites, of which 500 are company-owned. Some suitors want only Loop's mobile business, while a few are interested in the combined entity. If Airtel buys Loop's mobile business, the Khaitan-owned company will sell the tower business separately. A successful deal will reduce the number of claimants for the premium 900 MHz band in the Mumbai service area. Airtel had 4.1 million customers in Mumbai at the end of September and was ranked third in terms of subscribers. The addition of Loop Mobile's customer base would make Airtel the top operator in Mumbai, where Vodafone is currently the market leader with 6.8 million customers. Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm yesterday applied to participate in the spectrum auction and bid for the scarce 900 MHz band, which is crucial for both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. The government plans to auction 16 MHz of spectrum in the 900 MHz band each in Delhi and Mumbai and 14 MHz in Kolkata. Applicants have to bid for a minimum of 5 MHz. At the base price, 5 MHz of spectrum will cost Rs 1,800 crore in Delhi, Rs 1,640 crore in Mumbai and Rs 625 crore in Kolkata. Loop has decided to skip the spectrum auction scheduled on February 3. Its Mumbai licence expires in November and the company is required to bid afresh for airwaves to continue operations.

48,"LONDON: ARC Ratings, five credit ratings agencies mainly from emerging markets , launched on Thursday a rival to the sector's main players including Fitch and Moody's. Pitching itself as a new international credit ratings agency, ARC hopes also to take clients from Standard & Poor's (S&P), which along with Fitch and Moody's, faced heavy criticism following the financial crisis. ARC said it would introduce new financial risk ratings to sit alongside long-established debt grades such as the top triple A rating. But it will not use the term ""junk"" to describe non-investment grades. Five credit rating agencies from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America - all of which were established at the time of the financial crisis in 2008 - have jointly created Europe-based ARC Ratings to serve clients wishing to use international debt markets. ""The world has changed dramatically since the collapse of the US subprime debt market in 2008 which triggered the credit crunch,"" ARC chief executive Jose Pocas Esteves said at the launch in London. ""ARC and its five founding partners believe that the old methods and approaches are no longer sufficient."" Investors use ratings agencies to categorise likely returns and risks on financial instruments ranging from government debt to bonds issued by companies. Changes to ratings can affect the levels of financial returns earned by lenders and costs to borrowers. Ratings are also important for pension and mutual funds , as they are often limited to investing into assets which have been rated a certain level by the agencies. ""We will introduce a new rating, that is a Systemic Risk Rating (SRR),"" ARC's chief ratings officer Uwe Bott told reporters at the launch. ""These risks could be for example the so-called tapering by the Federal Reserve... and what the impact might be on markets"" going forward.

49,"ISLAMABAD: India and Pakistan are working to allow three banks to set up branches on each other's soil to normalise trade relations and boost commerce, Minister of State for Commerce Khurram Dastagir Khan has said. The two sides had agreed in August 2012 to issue a full banking licence to two banks from each country. However, normalisation of trade was hit after Pakistan failed to deliver on a commitment to grant Most Favoured Nation-status to India in January last year. ""We were told that the Reserve Bank of India had since, I would say, lessened its restrictions, it is no longer two banks. Any bank that fulfils the requirement can apply. For the time being, we are working on three banks each,"" Khan told PTI here. The issue of setting up bank branches on each other's soil was raised with Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma by Pakistan's Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif when he visited New Delhi recently. Khan, who left for India today to participate in a SAARC business meet, said, ""The State Bank of Pakistan has just written to the RBI that three banks would like to open their branches in India. I don't know when but it will happen. Some movement has taken place."" In 2012, the two Indian banks allowed to operate in Pakistan were the State Bank of India and Bank of India. On the Pakistani side, the quasi-state owned National Bank of Pakistan and privately owned United Bank Ltd were selected for running full banking operations in India once they obtained licences. However, there has not been much forward movement on the issue. Khan, a top leader of the ruling PML-N party, argued that the biggest hurdle to normal trade ties was the ""very restrictive visa regime"". ""People cannot travel to the other country. Visa is not something that appears on trading figures but is very substantial. If businessmen from one country cannot travel to another country and see firsthand and analyse the economic opportunities that are there, then trade is severely hampered,"" he said. ""Visa restriction is what we call a non-tariff barrier,"" he added. Khan pointed out another issue not reflected by trade figures was the lack of bilateral banking relations. ""That is also not a trading issue but is a necessary facility required for trading. So banking relationship has to be there. Another issue that we will talk about, maybe not in this trip, is to allow communication network. Allow roaming,"" he said. ""And here I am quite definite that obtaining a SIM in Pakistan is miles easier than it is in India. So if people can't communicate and use the banking channel, and if they can't travel, it is a hurdle to trade,"" he said.","India, Pakistan to allow 3 banks in each other's country: Minister - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-pakistan-to-allow-3-banks-in-each-others-country-minister/articleshow/28899899.cms
50,"Citigroup earnings: 'A tale of two Citis' Citigroup is the first big bank to report fourth-quarter earnings that disappointed investors. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Citigroup failed to live up to Wall Street's expectations Thursday as it reported fourth quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. The bank reported a gain of 82 cents per share (backing out one-time gains and charges) on revenues of $17.8 billion. Analysts had expected Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) to post a profit of 95 cents per share on revenues of $18.2 billion, according to FactSet. Although net income was up sharply from a year ago to $2.7 billion, revenues for the fourth quarter were down 1% from the same period a year ago, Citigroup said. Citigroup said its retail banking revenue dropped as higher interest rates slowed its mortgage financing business. Investment banking revenues, derived from activities such as underwriting initial public offerings and advising companies on mergers, were up from a year earlier though. He said rising interest rates and elevated legal and regulatory costs weighed on results. But structural changes as well as an increase in loans and deposits should position the company for more robust growth in 2014, Corbat claimed. Still, he acknowledged some impatience on the part of investors. ""Being pleased with our progress doesn't make us satisfied and it doesn't make our shareholders,"" he said. Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities for Standard Life Investments, which manages almost $300 billion, characterized Citi's earnings as mixed. He said that while bond-trading was ""clearly disappointing"" and that high expenses dampened profit, the bank showed strong international consumer loan growth. ""This quarter was really a tale of two Citis,"" he said. Daniel Marchon, an analyst with Raymond James Financial who covers the bank, thinks Citigroup may have dialed back some risk in the fourth quarter ahead of its stress test with the Federal Reserve scheduled for early this year. The stress tests are meant to help the Fed gauge how the banks would fare in another financial crisis. The financial sector is expected to have the best profit growth in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet Research. Overall, earnings for the companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up 6.1% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Like other banks, Citigroup has clawed its way back since the depths of the financial crisis.

51,"New York could learn a thing or two from California. The lesson could make Albany richer by billions of dollars. Iím talking about a sales-tax enforcement effort that started in the Golden State just two weeks ago. It aims to outlaw ìzappers,î which are high-tech cash registers that allow stores, restaurants and other businesses to make transactions ó and the tax owed on those sales ó disappear. Jerome Horton, a top tax official in California, said, ìUnfortunately, sometimes the criminals are one step ahead of us in the use of technology.î In New York, the tax cheats are a block-and-a-half in the lead. And law enforcement isnít even trying to catch up. ìNot since the days of Al Capone,î added Horton, ìhas the underground economy been so pervasive. Zappers are an indication of just how sophisticated the underground economy is.î He says California loses an estimated $8.5 billion a year to all sorts of tax dodges. ìThere arenít enough police officers to effectively arrest this problem.î So instead, California is going to seize the assets of tax cheats ó and do it immediately. The dishonest cash registers alone are said to cost California $214 million a year in lost revenue. So what about New York? Itís worse here, as I pointed out in a column I wrote on Jan. 25, 2011, that had the headline ìTodayís special: Scam dodges $400M in sales tax.î That was three years ago! At $400 million per annum, Albany would have been cheated out of $1.2 billion in revenue just counting from that day to this. But the scam had been going on for quite a while before I got wind of it. In fact, Albanyís revenue-enforcement people were actively on the case and had already cornered tax cheats through sting operations ó before the effort was suddenly shut down. Why did New York suddenly shut it down? Thatís apparently one of those mysteries of bureaucracy that we arenít meant to understand. But it seems to have had something to do with a turf battle between investigators in the field and tax auditors who thought they could catch the cheats the old-fashioned way ó by looking at their books. The lack of interest in this scam is particularly odd because Albany was in 2011 ó as it is now ó desperate for additional tax revenue. In fact, I wrote that 2011 column as part of a series on how the state could easily find an extra $1 billion a year just by enforcing existing laws. But as far as I can tell, nobody in Albany listened to my suggestions ó and the rogue cash registers continue to delete sales. Tom Stanton, the former head of New York tax enforcement set up stings against the dishonest ìpoint-of-sale terminalsî ó the fancy term for cash registers. Stanton tells me the state was aggressively going after zappers by 2011. In fact, he and his agents had set up phony restaurants in Buffalo, Dutchess County, Albany and in The Bronx to trap the people who sold these terminals. Their cover story was this: The restaurants were just being started by the East Indian Restaurant Association, and they needed registers. No mention was made of wanting to skim sales tax from the state. But Stanton says that 22 of the 23 terminal vendors who pitched their products brought up the idea of cheating on their own. ìAll but one,î says Stanton, ìtold us that sales could be erased.î In fact, the terminal vendors were selling the idea that they could make ì30 to 40 percent of their businessî disappear from the official receipts. The zappers work by having the registerís software automatically not record, say, every third or fourth entree or dessert. As a kicker, the software will also falsely adjust your inventory. And if state auditors happened by, the terminal makers promised to crash the customerís computers and put all the vital information on a flash drive. When state auditors then tried to determine if a restaurant was reporting all its business to the state and paying all its taxes, the business owner would have the phony books to back up its claims. In fact, state investigators had actually flipped a vendor for a major cash-register company. He was going to cooperate in exchange for a modest payment and the chance to stay out of jail. So what happened? Nothing. The deal was botched, Stanton said, when it got to the state Attorney General level. Stanton says he doesnít know what exactly went wrong, except that law-enforcement authorities who had to approve the deal never did. Then, of course, I wrote about this tax scam in 2011. What happened after that? Nothing. For all I know, Albany didnít care. The good news ó if there is any when you are already in the hole for $1.2 billion in unrecoverable tax revenues ó is that Stanton and his crew recorded the sting operation. And those recordings are stashed in the files of the state Tax Department. Will Albany dig them up and go to the head of the anti-zapper class? Will it learn anything from California? Donít bet on that happening. Thereís an old saying that ìitís easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.î Well, in Albany itís easier to ask for higher taxes than it is to collect the ones already owed. Should New York be more like California? Mr Crudele is accurate in his report, no argument there. However, I think restaurants hide their net intake not to avoid sales tax but to lessen their annual income taxes.

52,"MOVIE REVIEW. The Nut Job. Animated features have become so formulized that the late-1950s style of ìThe Nut Jobíí is very welcome ó at least until an animated version of South Korean pop star Psy turns up to perform ìGangnam Styleíí at the end. This Canadian-Korean co-production exhibits a dazzling array of influences, from Warner Bros. cartoons to the ìIce Ageíí series ó to even ìLarceny Inc.íí (1942), an Edward G. Robinson film based on a play by S.J. and Laura Perelman. And then thereís a lead character, Surly, a scatterbrained and self-absorbed squirrel voiced by Will Arnett ó who looks very much like Remy the rat of the vastly superior ìRatatouille.íí When Surlyís antics end up immolating a tree containing nuts being stored for the winter, he is banished from Oaktonís (ironically named) Liberty Park by its leader, a raccoon imposingly voiced by Liam Neeson. Surly accidentally stumbles on some crooks who have just purchased a nut shop in order to tunnel to a bank vault across the street (thatís the Perelman connection). Our hero is interested only in keeping himself in nuts, but his friend Andie (the dreaded Katherine Heigl, always better heard than seen) hopes this is a way for Surly to make amends and earn his way back into the park. The small-town setting of a half-century ago is beautifully animated by director Peter Lepenotis and his team, and there are some nicely staged old-school action sequences. The slapstick involving Surly, his mole sidekick and the gang of crooks (Stephen Lang voices their leader) is often amusing, even if the characters arenít as well developed as they should be. The celebrity voice performers arenít particularly well cast, either. The exceptions are Brendan Fraser as Grayson, an egotistical squirrel who thinks of himself as a hero, and Maya Rudolph as a cowardly bulldog who serves as the negligent guard for the hapless crooks. ìThe Nut Jobíí has an interesting anti-socialist subtext, with the seemingly benevolent raccoon revealing himself as a power-mad dictator. Itís the most political non-Pixar cartoon feature since the very left-leaning ìThe Ant Bullyíí eight years ago.",Comedic chestnuts pay off in animated ëThe Nut Jobí | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/comedic-chestnuts-pay-off-in-animated-the-nut-job/

The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent, the worst performer among the 10 major S&P sectors. After a lackluster start to 2014 on concerns stock valuations may too high after a 30-per cent rally in the S&P 500. last year, the index surged 1.6 per cent over the past two sessions to a fresh high Wednesday, its first since Dec. 31. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 56.77 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 16,425.17, the S&P 500 lost 4.15 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 1,844.23 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.61 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,213.273. UnitedHealth Group Inc weighed on the Dow even as the largest US health insurer reported a higher fourth-quarter profit and the addition of 170,000 members, and said 2014 earnings would improve. Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $72.70. CSX Corp slumped 7.1 per cent to $27.15 after the railroad late Wednesday posted a smaller fourth-quarter profit on weak coal volume. Twelve companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report on Thursday, including chipmaker Intel Corp after the close. Data pointed to an economy that continues to grow at a slow, but steady pace. The consumer price index increased 0.3 per cent after being flat in November while the core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose only 0.1 per cent, slowing from a 0.2 per cent gain in November, which suggested underlying inflation is muted. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 and claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, suggesting a sharp slowdown in job growth in December was likely to be temporary.

54,"The Jets and Ryan agreed to a contract extension that will contractually bind the coach and team through at least the 2015 season, according to a source. Ryanís current contract was scheduled to run out after the 2014 season. ESPN reported Ryan received a multi-year extension , but it does not sound that simple. A source said the contract is written in way so that it looks like a multi-year extension, but the team could easily get out of the deal after 2015. Most times coaches are given guaranteed money, meaning the team has to pay the coach his salary even if he is fired. According to a source, Ryanís deal is not fully guaranteed after 2015, so if the Jets wanted to fire him after that season, they would not have to pay him much. The 51-year-old Ryan is entering his sixth season as the Jets head coach. He is 46-40, including the playoffs. His teams have missed the playoffs the last three seasons and he has not had a winning year since 2010, when he led the Jets to their second consecutive AFC Championship game. The job status of Ryan was a constant story in 2013 after Jets owner Woody Johnson fired general manager Mike Tannenbaum and retained Ryan following the 2012 season. New general manager John Idzik was expected to want to hire his own coach after last season, but the Jets overachieved in the eyes of many by going 8-8 and Johnson announced after the teamís season-ending 20-7 victory over Miami on Dec. 29 that Ryan would return in 2014. Ryan arrived in 2009 promising a Super Bowl. He has yet to deliver on that. His teams went to back-to-back AFC title games in his first two seasons, but have gone 8-8, 6-10 and 8-8 in the three years since. When is the parade?...8-8 wooohoooo, sign everybody to extentions.

55,"This week's ""Poke Me"", invites your comments on 'Why Nandan Nilekani should become the CM of Karnataka'. The feature will be reproduced on the edit page of the Saturday edition of the newspaper with a pick of readers' best comments. So be poked and fire in your comments to us right away. Comments reproduced in the paper will be the ones that support or oppose the views expressed here intelligently. Feel free to add reference links etc., in support of your comments. Do successful businessmen make good politicians? The facts do not seem to suggest so. Since the year 1900, the United States has had twenty presidents. Of them, only five had business backgrounds prior to entering politics although none of them had much impact as President. Conversely, none of the great Presidents - Roosevelt, Truman or Wilson - had backgrounds in business. Historians suggest that while politicians with business backgrounds had the ability to conjure grand intellectual plans, they were poorer at execution. We've seen a similar trend in India where the chasm between ""doers"" and ""thinkers"" has widened. What can Indian business leaders looking to enter politics learn from this? There are no meaningful examples of Indian businessmen who have successfully reached the upper echelons of politics. The United States, however, provides an interesting example by way of Michael Bloomberg , who arguably is the most successful American businessmen-turned-politician. Bloomberg understood, for example, that becoming a successful politician demanded a far broader skill set and hence took on the challenging task of serving as Mayor of New York for 12 years. He achieved many goals that were important to New Yorkers during his tenure including reforms in health, education, and infrastructure, and even the wiping out of the city's budget deficit. There are two lessons Indian businessmen looking to enter politics can learn from Bloomberg. First, if you wish to create impact, you need to start by cutting your teeth by focusing on a city or a state. Clearly, it's not just in a few states in India where this formula works. Most businessmen, however, are not keen to invest the time to prove themselves the hard way given the obvious risks involved. Taking the easier path, however, is probably even a bigger risk . To illustrate why, think of the current cabinet of ministers as an executive committee of a business conglomerate. If the entire committee were filled with people from the legal and strategy divisions - as is the case today - rather by people who've actually managed businesses before - would you expect great things from them? Why should politics be that different? Second, strong political support is required to get into positions of responsibility. In the case of Bloomberg, he was endorsed by Mayor Rudolf Giuliani , which tilted the balance in winning him the election. How many Indian businessmen can hope to receive such support? Seen through this prism, the business leader best positioned to have an impact on Indian politics is Nandan Nilekani. He has endeared himself to the Congress given his adept handling of the national identification project. He has demonstrated that he can take criticism in his stride and that he can navigate seamlessly around political webs. Having decided to take the plunge into politics, he now needs to answer a more fundamental question: how will he build his political career. Accepting the position of a cabinet minister will be a cardinal mistake. Remember, ministers in today's cabinet have the sharpest thinkers in their midst and the most number of ministers from Harvard, Stanford and Wharton. Despite this, these individuals have punched well below their weight because they appear much more comfortable dealing with people like them - but appear vastly out of their depths in dealing with people unlike them - which has prevented them from converting ideas into action. For those who blame such an outcome on a militant opposition, consider how a business leader with an operational background would have dealt with a belligerent trade union. Would he have blamed his adversaries for inaction or carried them along? Viewed against this backdrop, Nilekani's first decision should be his hardest one: he should aspire to become the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Working in the trenches will enhance his skill set and will prepare him for future duels. Understandably, the responsibilities of a Chief Minister may not be something that Nilekani may wish to be given. However, given his remarkable temperament - both in business and in the national identification project - there is every reason to believe he will succeed. In conclusion, one of the many contributions made by Nilekani has been his excellent book that sought to imagine the future of India. Every Indian should expect more. We must hope that the legacy he leaves behind is one of a man who prioritized process over outcome in terms of how he built his political career, which enabled him to convert his imagination of what India should be - into a reality it so thoroughly deserves.",Poke Me: Why Nandan Nilekani should become the CM of Karnataka - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/poke-me/poke-me-why-nandan-nilekani-should-become-the-cm-of-karnataka/articleshow/28794490.cms

The Knicks are 6-2 in 2014, and the only player not buying in so far is Smith, who has been benched twice in the past four games. ìHeís going to have to be with it if he wants to be a part of it,íí Woodson said. ìAs coach, itís my job to make sure that happens. Heíll be back in uniform tonight and we expect him to play at a high level. Thatís what I expect from a coaching standpoint.

Smith grumbled aloud about playing time while sitting out most of the Mondayís overtime against the Suns and reportedly was late for a team meeting Tuesday in the Charlotte hotel. Woodson said on his radio show Wednesday his ìsupportî for Smith would not change, indicating Smithís banishment was over. Asked Thursday whether he had spoken with Smith, Woodson said: ìThereís nothing that needs to be said. I expect J.R. to be a pro and concentrate on playing basketball. Thatís why heís wearing a Knick uniform. Itís a privilege to play in this league. You got to do all the necessary things on and off the court to be a pro in this league.

However, Prigioni said he had to discuss the status with Woodson, who could decide to hold him back for Fridayís game against the Clippers at the Garden. Woodson said he had ìbad feelingíí coming back to this arena where the Knicksí season ended last May in the second round of the playoffs against the Pacers.

57,"LONDON ó Since Mikhail Prokhorov purchased the Nets four years ago, he has delivered plenty of flash and a lot of headlines. But, behind the scenes, he always has relied on a team of people close to him to help him run the franchise. In recent months, however, it appears the dynamics have begun to shift, with Sergei Kushchenko ó a longtime Prokhorov associate and his top sports advisor ó gradually becoming a bigger presence around the franchise. Meanwhile, Dmitry Razumov ó the CEO of ONEXIM Group, Prokhorovís investment vehicle ó has receded into the background. Up until now, Prokhorovís point man with regards to the Nets had been Razumov. Whenever the Nets had a big decision to make, Razumov always was involved. He was often cited by the front office for his role in various moves, including helping convince Deron Williams to re-sign with the team in July 2012. It appears now, however, that Kushchenko ó who also is currently in charge of the Russian Biathlon Union, a job Prokhorov previously asked him to take on ó is beginning to step into the role Razumov once held. A member of the franchiseís board of directors since 2011, Kushchenko, 52, unexpectedly attended a practice and game in Brooklyn last month during one of the teamís scheduled board meetings, and will presumably watch Thursdayís game here against the Hawks with Prokhorov. Razumov hasnít been seen at games since early in the season. ìIt doesnít change a lot,î Kushchenko said of his role within the team through his interpreter before the Nets practiced Wednesday at O2 Arena. ìFrom the very beginning, I was involved. We discuss every move. We talk a lot about everything.î While Razumov has had a significant role behind the scenes, thereís little doubt Kushchenkoís extensive basketball background ó he spent over a decade as a successful basketball executive in Russia ó will allow him to step seamlessly into a similar role. Kushchenkoís appearances around the team have come even as heís in the midst of preparing for next monthís Olympics in Sochi, Russia. When asked if his role within the Nets organization would grow after the Olympics, his response was short. ìLetís wait for Sochi first,î he said. His rÈsumÈ within the game is an impressive one. Kushchenko spent seven years with Ural-Great, building the club from an expansion franchise in the Russian Super League to one that claimed the league championship in 2001 and 2002 ó becoming the only team besides CSKA Moscow to win the Russian Super League title in the last 22 years. It was at that point Prokhorov ó then the owner of CSKA, which had finished in fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the Russian Super League in those seasons ó lured Kushchenko away from Ural-Great to become CSKAís president. Kushchenko was immediately able to restore the team to its proper place atop Russian basketball, leading CSKA Moscow to the league title in his first year as team president and beginning a still current string of 11 consecutive Super League titles. In addition, CSKA returned to prominence in European competition during his seven years as team president, winning two Euroleague titles, reaching two other finals and finishing in the final four of the competition all seven seasons. ìHe is a basketball fanatic,î Andrei Kirilenko said. ìIíve known him since he was at Ural Great. Ö Heís always been crazy about basketball. He gets involved in a lot of basketball in Russia. Iím not surprised heís around. ìI think [Prokhorov is] lucky to have Sergey on his side, because heís really a guy who knows a lot about basketball.î When asked, however, Kushchenko made it clear he isnít planning on becoming the general manager of an NBA franchise. ìThe NBA is a very high level, and the league is changing every day,î he said. ìThereís a big difference [between the NBA and] European basketball, but [the NBA is] very interesting.î Kushchenko thinks the Nets finally have gotten things back on track after a tumultuous opening two months of the season. ìThe expectations were high, and the pressure was high during the year, but right now we can see the parts are clicking and finally we are maybe on the right track right now,î Kushchenko said. ìBecause there was so much changes, and it always takes time, always takes time to make things work. ìBut, right now, it looks like weíre on the right track.î While heís still interested in whatís going on with the Nets, Kushchenko is also spending plenty of time trying to live up to Prokhorovís equally high expectations for Russiaís biathlon teams in next monthís Olympics in their native Russia. ìWe would like to have two good gold medals,î Kushchenko, 52, said with a smile. ìWe would like to. Itís such very close to [our heart] in our country. ìThe pressure we have here in Brooklyn is nothing to the pressure on the biathlon in Sochi.î Now, in addition to trying to help Russia succeed in biathlon, it appears Prokhorov would like Kushchenko to take a more active role in reshaping the Nets into the championship team Prokhorov has insisted they will become since he bought them four years ago.",Meet the Russian whoís taking on a bigger role with Nets | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/ally-of-nets-owner-takes-a-bigger-role/
58,"MUMBAI: The rupee ended little changed on Thursday as dollar demand from importers was adequately met by dollar selling by foreign banks, likely on behalf of clients looking to invest in the domestic debt market. Bonds continued to gain for a fifth straight session with foreign funds having bought more than $2 billion worth of bonds so far in 2014. Broad strength in the dollar versus most other regional and major currencies prevented the rupee from making sharp gains while sustained selling from foreign banks limited any sharp fall, holding the pair in a tight range.

59,"NEW DELHI: Credit Suisse in its latest report has downgraded Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel, citing reports that as as many as eight operators have shown interest in bidding in the upcoming spectrum auctions. In addition to the obvious renewal incumbents (Bharti, Vodafone), this list crucially includes RIL-Jio for both 900 and 1,800 bands. Eight telecom operators, including Vodafone, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm applied for spectrum auction slated for February 3, raising hopes that the government would garner more than Rs 11,343 crore from it. The government has set a revenue target of Rs 40,874.50 crore for this fiscal year from the auction, one-time spectrum charge and annual regular licence fee. Credit Suisse is of the view that RIL-Jio's entry is against current market expectations. Unlike the low-priced voice strategy of other recent challengers, with an 1,800 Mhz plus 2,300 Mhz voice plus data strategy RIL could target the top end of incumbents' customer base without having to resort to steep price discounts. In the subsequent two auctions (November 2012 and March 2013), however, RIL belied expectations and chose not to participate in the auctions, added the report. The immediate impact is that of intense competition in auctions and the longer term impact could be increased competition and higher capex for incumbents. The brokerage firm is of the view that conditions now are even more conducive for RIL's business case than in August 2012, with 1) up to 50% cut to spectrum reserve prices after successive failed auctions, with 900 MHz now priced at roughly the same price as 1,800 MHz was priced 18 months ago; and 2) higher RPMs and industry profitability after the recent voice tariff increases. Credit Suisse downgraded Bharti Airtel to 'neutral' and Idea Cellular to 'underperform' as entry of RIL-Jio is likely to infuse intense competition in the auctions. ""We build 150-250 bps revenue market share loss for Bharti/Idea over the FY15/FY16 (along with reversal of the recent RPM increases),"" said the Credit Suisse report. The brokerage firm also builds full NPV hit from the spectrum renewals.

61,"How to invest when the market feels scary. ""We're subject to the same dynamics as fish in the ocean,"" says Andrew Lo, professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) When economist Andrew Lo, 53, was working on his Ph.D. in the mid-1980s, he had little reason to doubt the theory that stock prices can't be predicted. Then he started on a paper that he thought would show that the market's weekly ups and downs were random. ""We discovered, to our shock and amazement, that the theory failed,"" recalls Lo, sitting in his tidy MIT office overlooking the Charles River in Cambridge, Mass. He and collaborator Craig MacKinlay spent a decade confirming and trying to explain their results. The answer involved a bit of economics, a bit of psychology, and a bit of evolutionary biology. Lo, who has advised the government on how to avoid another financial crisis, calls his competing theory the ""adaptive-markets hypothesis."" He says markets are efficient at processing information into prices most of the time. But traders aren't computers: At certain moments, especially in a crisis, investors respond to physiological cues we developed when threatened in the wild by, say, being eaten or speared. ""We're a biological species,"" Lo says. ""We're subject to the same kinds of dynamics as fish in the ocean and springbok on the plains of the African savanna."" Like indexers, Lo doesn't think picking stocks per se is worthwhile. From there, however, he goes off in a totally different direction. He thinks our biological hardwiring causes other aspects of the market, like investors' appetite for risk, to follow patterns. While you are accustomed to hearing that you must ride out the market's gut-wrenching ups and downs, Lo believes this is not only unnecessary but often counterproductive. Just as trying an extreme diet can backfire with late-night junk-food binges, white-knuckling through a crash won't work if you eventually cry uncle and cash out. ""You're being unrealistic to assume that people will happily see their retirement assets drop by 30% or 40% without doing anything,"" says Lo. ""Let's create a mechanism by which you can react in a safe and orderly manner."" He's not just talking theory. In addition to his academic work, Lo co-manages mutual funds. His Natixis ASG Tactical US Market ( USMYX ) , launched in September, uses mathematical models to monitor changes in volatility. The aim is to predict when investors' biological imperatives to flee the market are about to kick in. The fund uses futures contracts to shift money in and out of equities exposure, to maximize returns in bull markets and sidestep losses amid panics. Because futures involve borrowed money, stock exposure could range anywhere from zero to 130%. 2014 economy will 'return to normal' For investors inclined to indexing, the fund throws up a lot of red flags. It charges a 1.4% expense ratio plus a sales load. The fund doesn't have a long record or hypothetical index results to evaluate. Big investment decisions hinge on complex formulas. Lo says his fund can get cheaper if assets grow, and argues that for all their seeming simplicity, index funds were once regarded as odd too. Then they worked. ""It's the natural evolution of financial products,"" he says. The takeaway for you. You can hang back from Lo's unproven fund and still learn from him. Contrary to what efficient-markets purists say, markets go through bubbles and panics. Similar assets may move together in those times, which argues for lots of diversification. And recognize that your own hard-wiring means you'll be pulled to join the fleeing herd when a bear appears. Even if you think you are risk-tolerant, build an asset allocation with enough safer assets to keep you from feeling threatened. You may not know the next turn of the market, but knowing you can survive it helps.

Theyíre supposed to be in there learning.î ìPS 106 now has books,î tweeted mom Persia Mucerino, who saw the most basic of learning tools being delivered as she picked up her daughter from kindergarten class at 3<U+2009>p.m. ìIím shocked it went on this long,î Mucerino, 27, told The Post.

They donít care about the kids in this school,î fumed Cindy Caromina, the mom of a third-grader. ìThey didnít do anything for these kids until the story in The Post came out,î added Jaron Spencer, father of third- and fourth-grade students. ìNow they are putting on a big show. But once the media goes away, theyíll go back to doing nothing for the kids.î PTA President Wendy Pratt ran the meeting ó which got heated at times ó and served as Sillsí apologist. ìI canít speak to how [Sills] dresses but no one here is perfect,î she said. ìAs far as the June dance, no one was forced to go.î PS 106 Principal Marcella Sills Photo: J.C.

63,"Top cop Bill Bratton has promised to crack down on drivers who have turned New York Cityís roadways into boulevards of death. Bratton and de Blasio met at one of the cityís most notoriously dangerous intersections at Northern Boulevard and 61st Street in Woodside ñ† where 8-year-old Noshat Nahian was killed in the crosswalk on his way to school in December ó to announce plans to prevent deadly collisions. ìA lost life is a lost life, whether to murder or a traffic accident,î Bratton said. For the first time ever, cameras installed to detect speeding on city streets, concentrated around school zones, will automatically generate tickets, beginning Thursday. Until now, they have generated only warnings. ìThis will be a top-to-bottom effort to take on dangerous streets and dangerous driving,î de Blasio said. ìWe arenít going to wait and lose a son, a daughter, a parent or a grandparent in another senseless and painful tragedy.î The mayor vowed to ìconfront this problem from every sideóand it starts today.î Traffic accidents killed 11 people in the first two weeks of the year. That rate reflects an alarming spike from 2013, when 173 pedestrians were struck and killed on New York City streets, according to preliminary figures. The top cop promised faster response times for police answering calls about serious accidents, deeper investigations and better technology and training for cops in the NYPDís Highway Division. Bratton also said heíll expand the division by 10 percent, or 60 cops, for a total of 270 officers focused on traffic and accidents, which claim about 4,000 lives each year, according to Transportation Alternatives. ìOne in three New Yorkers have been injured in traffic or know someone whoís been injured or killed on our roads,î said Paul Steely White, executive director of the advocacy group. Investigators will receive the same training as homicide detectives and department brass will continue to use TrafficStat meetings to review problem areas. Cops will be equipped with laser technology for speed detection and the city will roll out speed cameras at 50 intersections, officials said. City leaders said they plan to lobby Albany to make it a felony when someone with a suspended license seriously hurts or kills someone. When asked about the cab driver who received just a ticket for the crash that killed 9-year-old Cooper Stock on the Upper West Side last week, †de Blasio declined to comment specifically on that incident. ìMy broad view is that there are more cases that deserve those [more serious] charges,î he said. And, cops plan to crack down on drivers for failing to yield to pedestrians. Educational campaigns will target pedestrian and driver error, which accounts for most deadly pedestrian accidents. Theyíll also take aim at distracted driving, which, according to NYPD statistics, is the most common contributing factor and cause of collisions in the city. Surprisingly, most accidents caused by inattentive driving occur because of distractions other than cell phones, the department numbers show. The changes are part of de Blasioís Vision Zero, a joint effort between officials and victimsí families to completely eliminate the number of fatal accidents in the city within 10 years. ìItís time to put a stop to this epidemic,î Steely White said. ìTraffic deaths are preventable.î",Bratton vows to crack down on killer drivers | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/bratton-vows-to-crack-down-on-killer-drivers/
64,"A Brooklyn beer-garden owner won a court battle against a barmaid who had accused him of groping her ó and then had an affair with the detective working the case. Dale Hall, 46, wept into his hands as Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Robert Straus declared him not guilty Wednesday of sexual abuse, ending a nearly four-year legal nightmare in which he lost his daughter and his bar. ìIím just glad the lies are over,î said Hall, who sobbed as he left the court. Hall was accused of reaching into the panties of brunette server Saskia Hochs≠child in June 2010 at Hallís Fort Greene German beer hall, Die Stammkneipe. Hall says the waitress, 31, cooked up the sex claim in September of that year, because she was afraid of losing her job. ìI was about to fire her,î he said. ìI called her to cut her shifts down and she hung up.î Hochschild reported the alleged assault to Detective Rene Orrego, who arrested Hall two days later at Die Stammkneipe. Orrego and Hochschild started dating about a month later, although he didnít admit it to his bosses. In his testimony last week, Orrego, a 14-year NYPD veteran, said he lied in March 2011 about dating Hochschild because itís ìfrowned down upon by the department to fraternizeî with a complainant. The couple is now married, and NYPD Internal Affairs investigators are looking into their relationship. Probers have not revealed any finding, but now believe Orrego broke department rules by ìfraternizingî with Hochschild, according to documents obtained by The Post. During that trial, Orrego admitted that he brought the charges although his gal pal had been drinking the night of the alleged incident and even stayed at the beer garden for at least an hour after it had happened. Defense attorney Thomas Gass argued that the case had many problems, including a lack of physical evidence. Hall had previously declined a plea deal because he was ìaware that Detective Orregoís credibility is shot,î according to the Internal Affairs report. Reached at her Deer Park, LI, home, Hochschild declined to comment. Orrego could not be reached.",Beer garden boss cleared of groping barmaid | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/beer-garden-boss-cleared-of-groping-barmaid/

In the aftermath of the December 16 gangrape, Justice Mehra was appointed as the head of a commission set up to look into the lapses of police and suggest improvements for the security of women in the city. ìNot one suggestion in my report has been implemented,î Justice Mehra told Newsline on Wednesday. The Commission submitted its report on February 22, 2013. The 160-page report proposed a series of changes, including creating distress signal service for women; one-stop centres for rape victims; effective crime mapping and gender sensitisation. ìThey had asked me to submit the report within three months. I submitted it within half that time. But not one of my suggestions has seen the light of day,î Justice Mehra said. According to Justice Mehra, the most basic step proposed to curb sexual offences was to ìseparate the investigation wing of police from the section maintaining law and orderî. ìA police constable cannot be sent to investigate such crimes. A specialised agency is required for thisÖ the Supreme Court had mandated this in 2006Ö I specifically recommended it in the report, but nothing was done in this regard,î she said. The Mehra Commission had asked for a supervision committee to keep tabs on police probe. It had also asked for better coordination between police and the transport department. ìNone of these has come into effect. Police is as irresponsible as everÖ there is no gender sensitisationÖ people flout rules openly as usualÖ police take no action,î Justice Mehra said. In January 2013, the High Court had set up six fast-track courts (FTCs) to dispose cases of sexual assault against women. Dismissing the idea of FTCs as a ìfarceî, Justice Mehra said the six FTCs were ìhighly inadequateî to deal with the ìavalanche of such casesî. In response to the Commissionís report, the government had submitted an action-taken report on 23 of its suggestions. Of the 23 steps, 10 were directions to different departments; three were proceedings and suspensions of officers in transport and traffic departments; and, five were just remarks such as ìthe matter has been taken up with the GNCTD (Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi) and Delhi Policeî. The remark, Justice Mehra said, is synonymous with ìno action having been takenî. The commission had also recommended steps for better infrastructural support. Taking up the suggestion, the Union Home Ministry had unveiled the ìSafe City Projectî in six cities, including Delhi. The project focuses on the use of high-end technology for better crime detection. It includes installation of a CCTV camera network, creation of a database of suspects and purchase and use of superior surveillance devices.",Judge who probed Dec 16 rape says not one measure implemented | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/judge-who-probed-dec-16-rape-says-not-one-measure-implemented/

According to the prosecution, the names of these men cropped up during the interrogation of arrested accused Sayed Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal. ìThey all had a role in the conspiracy and provided help to the handlers in carrying out the terror attacks,î Nikam said. The 12 names are: Major Sameer, Nadeem Shaheed, Sajid Mir, Yakub alias Commander, Ishanullah, Saad Shabbir, Kasim, Hassan, Rasheed Abdullah, Abu Osama, Imran and Abu Shoaib. According to the prosecution, Major Sameer is the prime accused among the 12 and Ansari was in constant touch with the handlers at the time of the attack. Retired senior inspector Ramesh Mahale, who was the chief investigating officer in the case, said, ìNadeem played a key role in having Ansari join Lashkar-e-Toiba and took him to different training centres in Pakistan.

69,"Michael Starr makes the case for ëElementaryí: I was initially skeptical (so what else is new?) prior to watching ìElementaryî on CBS. A show in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyleís iconic British detective, Sherlock Holmes ó the one we all know and love ó never existed? Please. Oh, and weíre supposed to believe the Sherlock Holmes who exists in ìElementaryî (Jonny Lee Miller) is, like Conan Doyleís creation, a British-born recovering drug addict ó only here heís been transplanted to New York, where his brilliant deductive reasoning (and OCD) makes him an invaluable asset as a consultant to the NYPD? Well . . . yes. I quickly bought into the premise lock, stock and barrel ó and the series is terrific. What makes ìElementaryî so good ó at least in the context of its suspending-belief TV universe ó are the performances of its stars, both Miller and Lucy Liu, who plays Holmesí sidekick, Dr. Joan Watson. Sheís an ex-surgeon who abandoned medicine after an unfortunate incident and has morphed from Sherlockís ìsober companionî to his salaried crime-solving partner. Their on-screen chemistry (no romantic overtones ó yet) is palpable. Miller somehow imbues Holmes ó arrogant and condescending ó with just the slightest bit of vulnerability, making us like and admire him in spite of ourselves while Miller fires off his elaborate, florid dialogue effortlessly (or seemingly so). Watson herself is no shrinking violet, softening Sherlockís verbal blows with an ìare you kidding me?î stance while, in her own sly way, getting all up into her partnerís grill ó while respecting his ethereal brilliance. The show is fun and fast-paced, in spite of its over-the-top plots, and features a winning supporting cast (Aidan Quinn as world weary NYPD Capt. Tommy Gregson and Jon Michael Hill as top-notch, slightly cynical Det. Marcus Bell). Kudos to series creator Robert Doherty for adding a new wrinkle to a familiar pop-culture mainstay. Sara Stewart makes the case for ëSherlockí: I cringe at the term ìCumberbitch,î but Iím not going to lie ó the impending arrival of the third season of ìSherlockî on Sunday does make me a bit teenage-girl-shrieky inside. As the BBCís version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyleís quirky detective, Benedict Cumberbatch is so right for the part itís almost painful to watch anyone else try (apologies to RDJ and Johnny Lee Miller). Itís not (just) his aristocratic, weirdly reptilian good looks or the Alan Rickman-lite voice ó Cumberbatch just exudes effortless, amused intelligence. Heís the embodiment of the high I.Q. of the show, whose banter is so quick a non-Brit would be well advised to watch with closed captioning on (Iím still not sure I got every word from the last two seasons). In a world oversaturated with reboots, sequels and updates, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatissí creation is the rare worthwhile revisit: a contemporary rendition of the worldís greatest detective, meshing the utility of modern technology (texting often figures prominently) with a deliciously Victorian sense of leisure (Sherlock spends off hours at 221B Baker St. not on the Internet but playing the violin, doing questionable science experiments or just staring off into space). And the rest of the cast is equally impeccable. Has there ever been a part more well-suited to the twitchy, double-takey Martin Freeman? (Well, other than ìThe Officeî?) Marvel as his John Watson discovers Sherlockís back from the dead; the scene is a thing of comic beauty. Then thereís his brother Mycroft, played to simpering perfection by Gatiss himself, who very nearly walks off with Sundayís episode. Plus, you have to respect a show that so clearly adores its obsessive audience right back: Sherlockís return features not one but two fan-fictiony kisses between characters ó which Iím not going to spoil for you, donít worry. The episodeís title, ìThe Empty Hearse,î is the name of a group of Sherlock admirers (in the show) piecing together their hypotheses about how he pulled off his fake suicide, just like weíve all been doing here in the real world.

Ahead of the general elections, the state government has approved 180 proposals worth Rs 66 crore for undertaking development of basic civic infrastructure under the special funds for the city. However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is looking at this as an opportunity to save civic funds by taking up projects through state funds instead of using allocation meant for the same work in the civic budget. ìPMC has received a list of approved projects estimated at Rs 66 crore from the state government and a Government Resolution (GR) saying the special funds are meant only for taking up basic infrastructure projects in the civic jurisdiction,î said D P More, Deputy Municipal Commissioner. The state funds are apart from MLA and MP funds that are used for implementing civic infrastructure projects, he said. ìThis is the highest amount that the PMC has got so far under the special funds. The municipal commissioner has directed all civic departments to implement the projects through the special funds of state government instead of the civic funds allocated for the same work.î Since the state government list includes details of each work with funds allocated, he said the funds cannot be used elsewhere and will have to be returned if not used for the specific project. ìThere is no specific timeframe for using the funds, but the sitting legislators have been urging the civic administration to take up the projects with immediate effect,î More said. Congress legislator Vinayak Nimhan said the civic administration has to implement the work, while the district collectorate has to coordinate it but both government bodies have a lacklustre approach. ìThis is the largest amount the PMC has received so far under the special funds for civic development projects.

The Indian rupee , however, saw the largest bullish bets in one year as worries about inflation eased. Bearish bets on the Singapore dollar and the peso rose to their largest since late August, according to the bi-weekly survey of 14 analysts. The city-state's currency hit a near five-month low to the US dollar as local speculators and funds sold it on signs of a slowing economy. The peso fell to its weakest since September 2010 on stop-loss selling after breaks in chart and psychological supports and as offshore funds sold it. Sentiment on the Taiwan dollar turned bearish with its short positions at the largest level since late August. The Taiwan central bank was spotted intervening to prevent the island's currency from outperforming the South Korean won , according to local traders. Long positions in the won nearly halved to the lowest since late August, when sentiment on the won was slightly bearish. Offshore funds cut optimistic bets on the currency as the foreign exchange authorities kept warning against further appreciation in the second-best performing emerging Asian currency in 2013.

72,"NEW DELHI: After a stellar performance from Infosys last week all eyes are on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) which is scheduled to report its results for the quarter ended December 31 post market hours today. According to analysts, the company is likely to lead the sector on dollar revenue growth in notably a seasonally weak quarter due to furloughs, fewer working days and employees going on vacation. The technology major is likely to report a rise of 8.98 per cent in profit to Rs 5,124.50 crore from Rs 4,702 crore reported in the previous quarter, according to an ET Now Poll. Most brokerages are of the view that the company may report a 3.5 per cent revenue growth in dollar terms for Q3FY14 and give a positive outlook for FY15. After rallying over 70 per cent in 2013, the IT major is putting up a strong show in 2014 as well gaining nearly 10 per cent so far in the year. Historically, the stock has seen profit booking after the announcement of results and hence traders should adopt a cautious stance. The stock has already run up in anticipation of a good result and any negative surprise in the quarterly result could lead to decent profit booking. According to analysts, demand environment for IT stocks looks robust with green shoots appearing in most developed economies. Investors who own the IT stock should hold on to it as the stock is likely to move higher following earnings upgrades over the next few quarters. In 2013, TCS made low at 1,250 levels and high at 2,258. It closed the year 2013 with a 73 per cent gain. From that key moving average, TCS has been rallying smartly since the beginning of December 2013 and can be said to be in an uptrend. It has been forming higher top higher bottom on the daily chart, which is a sign of an uptrend as per Dow Theory. The company has shown consistent results in the last few quarters and has emerged as a market leader in terms of setting the trend for the entire IT sector. On yearly, monthly and weekly charts, the stock is trading in a long-term uptrend. Technical chart is also confirming TCS as a growth stock, say analysts. However, it is trading in overbought zone on monthly, weekly and daily charts and after the results it may be rangebound for some time and then may show strength in the medium to long term, with a target of Rs 2,700 and then Rs 2,900.

The stock has already run up in anticipation of a good result and any negative surprise in the quarterly result could lead to decent profit booking. The support levels on the downside are Rs 2,265 and Rs 2,100. On the upside, a move beyond 2,400 could lead to a consolidation in the range of Rs 2,300-2,600 in the next couple of months.

The nominations for the 86th Academy Awards , announced Thursday morning in Beverly Hills, Calif., were led by the 3-D space odyssey ìGravityî and the con-artist caper ìAmerican Hustle,î both with 10 nominations. The harrowing historical epic ì12 Years a Slaveî trailed closely with nine nominations. All were among the nine films nominated for best picture. The other nominees are ìCaptain Phillips,î îDallas Buyers Club,î îHer,î îNebraska,î îThe Wolf of Wall Streetî and ìPhilomena.î The most notable omission by the academy was Tom Hanks, whose lead performance in ìCaptain Phillipsî was widely considered a shoo-in. It was a particularly surprising snub since Hanks is widely beloved by the academy, having been nominated five times previously, winning for ìForest Gumpî and ìPhiladelphia.î Robert Redford, expected by many to be nominated for the shipwreck drama ìAll Is Lost,î also missed out on a best actor nod. Redford has never won an acting Oscar. With her nomination, Streep pads her record for most acting nominations. This is her 18th nod, including three wins, the last for 2011's ìThe Iron Lady.î Martin Scorseseís ìThe Wolf of Wall Streetî came into Thursday as one of the biggest question marks of an awards season that has often left many guessing. The nearly three-hour Wall Street extravaganza of money, sex and drugs became a lightning rod of debate, with many questioning whether it glamorized the infamous trader Jordan Belfort. Also doing well Thursday were Spike Jonzeís futuristic romance ìHerî (five nominations, including best original screenplay for Jonze), and Alexander Payneís black-and-white road trip ìNebraskaî (six nominations, including best director for Payne). One of the dayís biggest winners was the 27-year-old producer Megan Ellison, the daughter of billionaire Larry Ellison.

75,"MORE ON: JCPenney is shuttering 33 stores and everything must go ó including the employees. The struggling department-store chain said 2,000 workers are being fired as a result of the closings, which are slated to be completed by early May. Penney, which operates about 1,100 stores and reported 110,000 employees in November, said the downsizing will cut annual costs by $65 million. The announcement, made after the market closed on Wednesday, got jeers rather than cheers on Wall Street, as Penney shares fell 1.4 percent in after-hours trading to $6.91. ìThis does nothing to soothe the concerns about the holidays,î said one investor, referring to Penneyís vague press release last week saying it was ìpleasedî with year-end sales. ìIf the holidays went well, you donít need to close any stores, and if they didnít go well, you need to close 300 stores, not 33,î the investor added. Whatís more, hourly wages of affected workers, about 3,000, will be cut significantly, in many cases near minimum-wage levels, with no prospects of a raise in the future, according to some insiders. ìThese people are going to end up making less than they were while being forced to work harder,î according to one person close to the company. Separately, Penney confirmed itís bringing back sales commissions that had been banned by ex-CEO Ron Johnson, who believed pushy salespeople turned off shoppers. Employees selling window treatments and fine jewelry will be put on commission next month, while furniture salespeople will follow in March, JCPenney spokeswoman Kristin Hays said.

76,"The New Jersey geriatrician who admitted violating confidentiality agreements with his pharmaceutical clients still runs a clinic performing experimental drug trials on Alzheimerís patients. Dr. Joel Rossí clinic, the Memory Enhancement Center of America, in Eatontown, NJ, has eight to 10 trials going on at the moment, with big-pharmaceutical clients, he said Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, where he has testified that he gave accused inside trader Mathew Martoma illegal tips on drug trials being run by Elan and Wyeth. Ross, who has entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the government, testified that he gave confidential information to Martoma and other investors as part of his lucrative consulting business through six expert networks. Despite that admission, which first came to light last year, big pharma clients continue to do business with him. To be sure, a number of drug companies did pull their business from the clinic when Rossí role in the case was made public last summer. ìI lost a significant amount of business,î he told jurors Wednesday. A lawyer for Ross told The Post that about 40 percent of his clients ó including Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson ó dropped him. Other clinics he was involved with also shut down. Two pharma giants, Merck and Hoffman-LaRoche, clinic clients, according to its website, could be reached. Ross did not give Martoma the information that SAC allegedly used to make $276 million in profits and avert losses on Elan and Wyeth shares after getting early word on the negative drug trial results. The government alleges the key illegal tips came from Dr. Sidney Gilman ó the star witness against the former SAC portfolio manager. Ross seemed to corroborate what Gilman is expected to say.

77,"Ever since The Post first suggested in December that GWBridgegate created a rare opportunity for bold reform at the Port Authority, our case has only grown stronger. E-mails that have emerged since then show how officials manipulated the agency for rank political purposes. They highlight the dysfunction inherent in a $7 billion-a-year, 7,000-employee behemoth headed by two bosses with distinct agendas: the governor of New York and the governor of New Jersey. Surely the timeís ripe for someone ó perhaps Congress, which created the PA in 1921 ó to take a good, hard look at this agency and consider ways to pare it down and narrow its mission. Some good news: There are now signs the agency is heading in the direction we suggested in December, and aiming, at least, to scale back its sprawling portfolio. Even as the incriminating e-mails were emerging, Executive Director Pat Foye told us the agency would be ìreturning to [its] core missionî and focusing on ìtransportation infrastructure.î The new course, he said, was being taken ìas directed by both governors.î The agency is making a ìsubstantial investment in airports, bridges and tunnels, portsî and the PATH system, Foye said. Several projects are already in motion: A $1.3 billion plan to raise the roadway of the Bayonne Bridge, letting larger ships pass underneath to access local terminals. A $5.2 billion investment in upgrades at LaGuardia and JFK airports. Rehab work at the GW, including new suspender ropes, at a cost of $1.3 billion. Upgrades to Staten Islandís New York Container Terminal and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, to the tune of $250 million. The PA is also moving to privatize, with plans for a commercial developer to build and run a new Goethals Bridge, at a cost of $1.5 billion. This will be the first such arrangement with the private sector anywhere in the Northeast, the agency says. Thereís more contraction afoot, too. Indeed, the PA has already divested (or plans to soon) its stakes in a number of real-estate and other commercial or industrial enterprises, including major retail holdings at the World Trade Center, a waste-to-energy power plant in New Jersey, the Staten Island Teleport and Bathgate Industrial Park in The Bronx. These moves canít come fast enough. But itís not clear theyíll cure all the PAís structural ills: jobs based on patronage; political interference in what ought to be non-political decisions; the dual chains of command because of the two states; the inevitable inefficiencies of a large bureaucracy; and so on. The GW lane closures were a terrible breach of responsibility. Even worse would be to let this moment pass and settle for a few political scalps without addressing the underlying structural problems with the Port Authority that invited this abuse in the first place.

78,"WASHINGTON: As a young lawmaker defining himself as a presidential candidate, Barack Obama visited a center for scholars in October 2007 to give a speech on terrorism. He described a surveillance state run amok and vowed to rein it in. ""That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens,"" he declared. ""No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime."" More than six years later, the onetime constitutional lawyer is now the commander in chief presiding over a surveillance state that some of his own advisers think has once again gotten out of control. On Friday, he will give another speech, this time at the Justice Department defending government spying even as he adjusts it to address a wave of public concern over civil liberties. The journey between those two speeches reflects the transition from the backbench of the U.S. Senate to the chair behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Like other presidents before him, the idealistic candidate skeptical of government power found that the tricky trade-offs of national security issues look different to the person charged with using that power to ensure public safety. Aides said that even as a senator, Obama supported robust surveillance as long as it was legal and appropriate, and that now as president he still shares the concerns about overreach he expressed years ago. But they said his views have been shaped to a striking degree by the reality of waking up every day in the White House responsible for heading off the myriad threats he finds in his daily intelligence briefings. ""When you get the package every morning, it puts steel in your spine,"" said David Plouffe, the president's longtime adviser. ""There are people out there every day who are plotting. The notion that we would put down a tool that would protect people here in America is hard to fathom."" At the same time, aides said Obama was surprised to learn after leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, just how far the surveillance had gone. ""Things seem to have grown at the NSA,"" Plouffe said. ""I think it was disturbing to most people and I think he found it disturbing."" Yet it is hard to express indignation at actions of the government after five years of running it, and some involved in surveillance note that it was Obama who pushed national security agencies to be aggressive in hunting terrorists. ""For some, his outrage does ring a little bit hollow,"" said a former counterterrorism official. All of which leads to worries by critics of government surveillance that he will not go far enough on Friday. ""If the speech is anything like what is being reported, the president will go down in history for having retained and defended George W. Bush's surveillance programs rather than reformed them,"" said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Obama first confronted the questions of national security and privacy during his 2004 campaign for Senate, taking aim at the Patriot Act for ""violating our fundamental notions of privacy"" and declaring that ""we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries."" Once elected, Obama took an interest in curbing surveillance. ""He would ask me about various issues that relate to the topic of the day - how do you come up with policies that make sure that security and liberty are not mutually exclusive?"" recalled Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a leading critic of surveillance policies then and now. Obama co-sponsored a bill in 2005 to raise the standard required for federal agents using administrative subpoenas known as national security letters to obtain business records without court order. He joined other Democrats fighting the renewal of the Patriot Act until it was amended to address civil liberties concerns, then voted for its extension in 2006 after a compromise, breaking with Wyden who voted no. Obama's October 2007 speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars came after the revelation that President Bush had authorized warrantless surveillance in terrorism cases without permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. By then a presidential candidate, Obama criticized Bush's ""false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide."" But as a former Obama aide put it recently, ""The rhetoric was probably sharper than his votes."" By summer 2008, with the Democratic nomination secured and the White House now a real possibility, Obama voted for legislation essentially ratifying Bush's surveillance programs. Obama realized he would ""take my lumps"" from the left and said it ""was not an easy call for me"" but argued that putting the programs under the jurisdiction of the intelligence court restored accountability. As a result, after he won the election, surveillance issues were off his agenda; instead, he focused on banning interrogations techniques he deemed torture and closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""There wasn't really any serious discussion of what NSA was up to,"" said a former intelligence official, who like others did not want to be named describing internal conversations. The Guantanamo Bay prison remains open . Obama was told before his inauguration of a supposed plot by Somali extremists to attack the ceremony, what David Axelrod, his adviser, called a ""welcome-to-the-NBA moment before the first game."" Although the report proved unfounded, it reinforced to Obama the need to detect threats before they materialized. ""The whole Somali threat injected their team into the realities of national security in a tangible and complicated way,"" recalled Juan Carlos Zarate, the outgoing counterterrorism adviser to Bush who worked with the Obama team on the threat. So while instituting additional procedural changes, like more audits, Obama undertook no major overhaul of the surveillance programs he inherited. ""He's sitting on the other end of the pen now,"" said the former Obama aide. ""He has more information than he did then. And he trusts himself to use these powers more than he did the Bush administration ."" Just weeks after the inauguration, Judge Reggie B. Walton issued a secret ruling reprimanding the NSA for violating its own procedures. But when Obama was briefed, the case did not stir consternation. The president's team instructed the Justice Department to fix the problem but ""this was not a central concern and he was very quick in knowing how to deal with it,"" said a former administration official. The calculus had shifted enough that Obama began presiding over a record number of leak prosecutions. When civil liberties advocates visited to press him to do more to reverse Bush's policies, Obama pushed back. ""He reminded me that he had a different role to play, that he was commander in chief and that he needed to protect the American people,"" recalled Romero of the ACLU. That was brought home even more starkly at Christmas in 2009 when a Nigerian man tried to detonate explosives in his underwear aboard an airliner. At a meeting at the White House afterward, an agitated Obama ""was extremely firm"" with intelligence officials, saying, ""He expected us to do better,"" recalled one who was in the room. ""We hadn't had a major attack in a number of years and the fact that this guy came as close as he did - basically the detonator didn't work - and the fact that we hadn't detected it in advance really came as a shock to them,"" said John E. McLaughlin, a former deputy CIA director who participated in a review of the incident for the administration. Feeling little pressure to curb the security agencies, Obama largely left them alone until Snowden began disclosing secret programs last year. Obama was angry at the revelations, privately excoriating Snowden as a self-important narcissist who had not thought through the consequences of his actions. He was surprised at the uproar that ensued, advisers said, particularly that so many Americans did not trust him, much less trust the oversight provided by the intelligence court and Congress . As more secrets spilled out, though, aides said even Obama was chagrined. They said he was exercised to learn that the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was being tapped. Obama appointed a panel to review the programs. ""The point we made to him was, 'We're not really concerned about you, Barack, but God forbid some other guy's in the office five years from now and there's another 9/11?'"" said Richard A. Clarke, a former White House counterterrorism adviser who served on the panel. He had to ""lay down some roadblocks in addition to what we have now so that once you're gone it'll be harder"" to abuse spying capabilities. On the other hand, Obama was acutely aware of the risks of being seen as handcuffing the security agencies. ""Whatever reforms he makes, you can be sure if there's another incident - and the odds are there will be in our history - there'll be someone on CNN within seconds saying if the president hadn't hamstrung the intelligence community, this wouldn't have happened,"" Axelrod said. Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser working on Friday's speech, said Obama sees the issue as two separate questions - abuse of government power and extent of government power. With the 2008 legislation setting a new structure, the president had focused on avoiding abuse until the latest revelations. ""At this point, we're looking more systematically at these programs to ensure that we're taking into account both technological advances and also the need to inspire greater public confidence,"" said Rhodes. ""We have an ability to do essentially anything technologically. So do we have the appropriate legal and policy overlay to ensure that's focused?"" That will be the question Obama attempts to answer in the speech.",Barack Obama's path from critic to defender of spying - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/barack-obamas-path-from-critic-to-defender-of-spying/articleshow/28879693.cms

80,"MORE ON: What an astonishing situation is shaping up in the US Senate. The chamber is controlled by the Democrats, yet it looks like it is nearing a veto-proof majority for an Iran sanctions bill that amounts to, among other things, a vote of no confidence in the leader of the Democratic Party, President Obama. The billís aim is to approve in advance a return to sanctions against the Iranians if they fail to meet the agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry and the Europeans (or do I repeat myself?) just inked in Geneva. If the Iranians fail to keep their word, the bill would impose an even tougher sanctions regime. This has certainly set off the party foghorns. The Washington Post (which years ago bailed out on the Vietnam war in such a fashion that its editor, J. Russell Wiggins, left the paper, advising a colleague, ìKeep your hat handyî) says it sees the logic of the bill, which would put pressure on Iran, but still frets that it would be ìproblematic.î The Los Angeles Times is upset that the bill would express the ìsense of Congressî that America should ìstand with Israelî if it launches a military attack on Iran. The New York Times warns of ìdangerously misguided forcesî in the Senate. USAToday reckons the bill has so many sponsors that Iran will get the message without Congress actually passing the bill. (Why, then, do we need Congress to vote on anything?) The foghorns were blowing in 1938, too, after Britainís Neville Chamberlain gave Adolph Hitler everything he was asking for at the Munich conference in exchange for ìpeace in our time. In an editorial typical of the time, The Washington Post enthused, ìThe wings of death have grazed the faces of countless millions,î a fate supposedly averted by Chamberlainís appeasement of the dictator. It went on, ìIf men of every nation cannot learn from this experience, then is the common heritage of Western civilization doomed.î What seems to have startled todayís apostles of appeasement is the number of senators whoíve signed on as sponsors of the sanctions bill ó at least 58, including 15 or more members of Obamaís own party. They include New York Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer, for whom this is a critical moment. Schumer, after all, is maneuvering to be Senate majority leader. Thatís his career ambition. Harry Reid, the current leader, is carrying the presidentís water by refusing to allow a vote on this bill, which makes this an acid test of Schum≠erís ability. So far the real leadership among Democrats has come from New Jerseyís Bob Menendez. Itís hard to think of a previous situation quite like this, where a Senate controlled by the presidentís party is challenging its own president on a major foreign-policy initiative. Clearly President Obama sees this. The White House has been growing more strident by the day, questioning even the integrity of legislators backing the sanctions bill. ìIf certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American public and say so,î is how the spokesman for Obamaís National Security Council put it, claiming the Senate bill would make it ìmore likely that the United States will have to choose between military options or allowing Iranís nuclear program to proceed.î The reason the White House has gotten so strident is that it knows that what the Senate is doing amounts to a vote of no-confidence in the president himself. Itís not a matter of not trusting Iran. No one ó not even a single European ó trusts the Iranian regime. Whatís animating the Senate is a distrust of Obama. Heís been vowing to get tough with Iran his whole presidency. Heís promised, in respect of using the military, to keep all options on the table. Heís insisted heís got Israelís back. But the Iranians have spent the first three quarters of his presidency spinning their centrifuges to prepare an A-bomb, and now Obama has entered a deal that will tie our hands ó and Israelís. The thing to remember is that what Kerry is bringing back from Geneva is not a treaty ó not what the Constitution calls ìthe supreme Law of the Land,î as a treaty or the Menendez bill would be. Of course, if Kerryís deal were a treaty, requiring ratification, it wouldnít get to first base in the Senate. That in and of itself ought to be a warning.",Will Chuck Schumer stand up on Iran bill? | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/will-chuck-schumer-stand-up-on-iran-bill/
81,"MORE ON: This made my heart ache and my blood pressure spike: Actress Tamera Mowry, who is black, wept in an interview with Oprah Winfrey over the vile bigotry she has encountered because of her marriage to Fox News reporter Adam Housley, who is white. Misogynist haters called Mowry a sellout and a ìwhite manís whore.î International news outlets labeled the Internet epithets she endured ìhorrificî and ìshocking.î Horrific? Yes. Shocking? Not at all. What Mowry experienced is just a small taste of what the intolerance mob dishes out against people ìof colorî who love, think and live the ìwrongî way. Iíve grown so used to it that I often forget how hurtful it can be. Mowryís candor was moving and admirable. Itís also a valuable teachable moment about how dehumanizing it can be to work in the public eye. Have we really sunk to this? Young actresses in the 21st century forced to defend their love lives because their marital choices are politically incorrect? Weíre leaning backward in the regressive Age of Hope and Change. Letís face it: Mowryís sin, in the view of her feckless detractors, is not merely that she married outside her race. Itís also that she is so open about her love for a white man who ó gasp! ó works for reviled Fox News. Neither of them is political, but the mere association with Bad Things (Fox, conservatives, capitalism, the Tea Party, Christian activism, traditional values) is an invitation for unabashed hate. The dirty open secret is that a certain category of public figures has been routinely mocked, savaged and reviled for being partners in interracial marriages or part of loving interracial families (for a refresher, see the video clip of MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry and friends cackling at the holiday photo of Mitt Romney holding his black adopted grandson in his lap). And the dirty double standard is that selectively compassionate journalists and pundits have routinely looked the other way ó or participate directly in heaping on the hate. Have you forgotten? Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was excoriated by black liberals for being married to wife Virginia, who happens to be white. The critics werenít anonymous trolls on the Internet. They worked for major media outlets and institutions of higher learning. USA Todayís Barbara Reynolds slammed Thomas and his wife for their colorblind union: ìIt may sound bigoted; well, this is a bigoted world and why canít black people be allowed a little Archie Bunker mentality? .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. Hereís a man whoís going to decide crucial issues for the country and he has already said no to blacks; he has already said if he canít paint himself white heíll think white and marry a white woman.î Howard Universityís Afro-American Studies Chair Russell Adams accused Thomas of racism against all blacks for falling in love with someone outside his race. ìHis marrying a white woman is a sign of his rejection of the black community,î Adams told The Washington Post. ìGreat justices have had community roots that served as a basis for understanding the Constitution. Clarenceís lack of a sense of community makes his nomination troubling.î California state Senate Democrat Diane Watson taunted former University of California regent Ward Connerly after a public hearing, spitting: ìHeís married a white woman. He wants to be white. He wants a colorless society. He has no ethnic pride. He doesnít want to be black.î Mowry is not alone. The Thomases and the Connerlys are not alone. Poisonous attempts to shame are an old, endless schoolyard game played by bullies who never grow up and canít stand other peopleís happiness or success. Time doesnít lessen the vitriol or hostility. Take it from someone who knows. ìOriental Auntie-Tom,î ëëyellow woman doing the white manís job,î ëëwhite manís puppet,î ëëManila whoreî and ìSubic Bay bar girlî are just a few of the printable slurs Iíve amassed over the past quarter-century. You wouldnít believe how many Neanderthals still think they can break you by sneering ìme love you long timeî or ìholla for a dolla.î My IQ, free will, skin color, eye shape, productivity, sincerity, maiden name and integrity have all been ridiculed or questioned because I happen to be a minority conservative woman happily married to a white man and the mother of two interracial children who see Mom and Dad ó not Brown Mom and White Dad. Mowryís got the right attitude. She wiped away her tears and told Oprah that haters wouldnít drag her down. Brava. Live, laugh, think and love without regrets. Itís the best revenge and the most effective antidote to crab-in-the-bucket syndrome.",Bigots slam Tamera Mowry for marrying white | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/bigots-slam-tamera-mowry-for-marrying-white/
82,"Roger Federer embraced the Melbourne heat as he raced into the third round of the Australian Open with a 107-minute 6-2 6-1 7-6 demolition of Blaz Kavcic on Thursday. Playing under the closed roof of Hisense Arena due to the extreme heat that earlier forced the suspension of play on the outer courts, the Swiss whipped through the first two sets in less than an hour. The third set was a little closer because of a marked improvement in the Slovenianís serve but the world number 99 could not halt the inevitable as Federer ended the lesson by clinching the tie-break 7-4. ìIím happy I got through on a hot day like this because itís going to change from the next round on for us now,î Federer said of the Melbourne heatwave, which is forecast to come to an end at the weekend. ìIt was a good first two sets I thought. I played really aggressive and it worked out.î It was clear from the outset that Federerís aggressive tactics, led by his strong serve and active movement around the net, was well suited to the stifling heat. ìI think in these conditions and on the hard courts itís what we want to try to do, especially early in the tournament, without taking stupid chances,î he said. ìOf course, I was overly aggressive at times, but Iíd rather be that than overly passive. But the error counts started mounting as well. ì(But) I was in command on my serve. That was for me most important ñ there Iím rock solid.î Fitness boost. After a sub-par 2013, Federer entered the new year ranked sixth in the world but brimming with confidence over his fitness. ìI feel very healthy,î he said. ìThat clearly is a great sign, because I can really focus on how I want to play tennis, where I want to move, how I want to play the ball, not, can I get to it?î Federer, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament, will meet either 31st seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco or Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili in the third round. As indication of his slight loss of ranking status, Federer was playing on Melbourne Parkís second show court for the first time in a decade. ìItís not really different to Rod Laver Arena really,î the four-times Australian Open champion said. ìI donít feel like you need to make an adjustment. The crowds were really nice.

83,"Maria Sharapova criticised Australian Open organisers for a lack of transparency over their ëextreme heat policyí when the Russian was left toiling on court for nearly an hour after organisers had invoked an official halt on Thursday. Sharapova and her opponent Karin Knapp of Italy slugged it out in 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) heat at Rod Laver Arena for three-and-a-half hours before the Russian prevailed 6-3 4-6 10-8 in their marathon second round encounter. The pair were already struggling in the oppressive conditions but continued their arduous battle some 50 minutes after matches on outside courts were suspended at about 1:50 p.m. local time (0250 GMT). The second round match concluded about 50 minutes after play had been suspended on all of the outside courts. ìI remember being really close to passing out but Iím feeling much better now,î Sharapova said in a courtside interview about the sweltering conditions. ìI think Iím just getting numb to it. ìThe recoveryís going to be pretty important now.î The 26-year-old Italian, who had never beaten a top-10 player in her 12-year career, had looked to be in trouble early against the third seedís powerful ground strokes but gradually wore the Russian down. Players have slammed organisers for failing to call off matches earlier, with some describing the conditions as dangerous, and one Croatian player in the menís draw expressing fear for his life on Wednesday. Rather than use the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat, organisers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Global Temperature composite, which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions. Under a change to the rules for this year, the decision on whether to stop matches is now at the discretion of tournament referee Wayne McKewen. ìThere is no way getting around the fact that the conditions were extremely difficult, and have been for the last few days,î the third seed Sharapova told reporters. ìItís a tough call. I mean, I think the question I have is no one really knows what the limit is. ìNot the players (nor) the trainers themselves when you ask them when will the roof be closed. Roof open. ìNo one actually knows what that number is in comparison to humidity or the actual heat. ìSometimes you wish you knew, because itís ñ it just depends on Iím not sure who, a referee or the meteorologist, and there are just a lot of questions in the air that maybe should be solved. ìI asked the trainer the other day, ëwhat does it take for the roof to be closed or matches to be stopped?í She said, ëwe have no control over thisí.î Despite the suspension, players could only walk off court at the conclusion of the set they were playing, according to the policy. With no tiebreaks in deciding third sets for the women entrants at the Australian Open, nor for fifth sets for the men, Sharapova and Knappís battle continued well after the suspension was called, with Rod Laver Arenaís retractable roof left open. ìI think the question is from the second to the third set,î Sharapova said of the unused roof. ìThatís because everyone knows there is no tiebreaker in the third set, so once you start that set, youíre going to be out there until youíre done. Thatís the question I have. ìI would love to know a bit more detail before ñ not even before I get on the court, but just in general itís good to know. I didnít even know there was no play when I left the court. I mean, I had no idea.î Sharapova, who will meet 25th-seeded Frenchwoman Alize Cornet in the third round, joked that she was getting ìnumbî to the heat in her courtside interview but will surely look forward to far cooler temperatures forecast for the weekend. ìIím really happy to get through,î she said. ìI really am.

84,"Related. At the start of the Hero Hockey World League, Indiaís hockey skipper Sardar Singh had promised his side wouldnít just make up the numbers but would surprise their opponents. Its unlikely anyone took him very seriously at the start of the tournament. After the first couple of defeats, one would be even less inclined to think so. The draw against Germany on Monday was perhaps the first time, there appeared to be some validity to the skipperís predictions. But on Wednesday, ten minutes into their game against defending world champions Australia and with a two goal to nothing lead, it is likely even Sardar would have been surprised. The match eventually finished 7-2 to the Australians, but at least for the first quarter of the game, India looked like pulling off the biggest upset of the tournament. The match had got off to a fast start. India had put together their first good opportunity in the opening minute of the game courtesy a move by K Uthappa and Mandeep Singh. But while the chance came to nothing, the lead eventually came in the sixth minute. Dharamvir Singh found space on the right, crossed to Birendra Lakra who shot on target from a tight angle. The goalbound attempt caught an Australian stick on the way to the net, but the umpires arms were pointing to the centerline all the same. Australia had a chance to pull things back when they earned a PC in the 9th minute, but PR Sreejesh cleared the high drag attempt. Australia would have known that India would come hard at them, but they still seemed unprepared for it. They made some surpringly basic errors including in the 10th minute when they left Yuvraj Walmiki unmarked on the left flank. That meant Nikkin Thimaiah on the right turned past a defender and fired a hit at the goalkeeper, Walmiki was able to tip the ball with a single hand on the stick to make the scoreline even more improbable. But the Australians arenít World champions for no reason. Their backs to the wall, Australia slowly took back control of the game. The Indians, meanwhile, much like an inexperienced runner who goes goes hard at the start of a marathon carried by adrenaline as much as anything, hit a wall. This one was quite literal, made up of massive Kookaburra defenders, who saw nothing in getting a bit physical where they needed to. Two minutes before that, the Australians had got on the scoreboard. Affan Yousuf was dispossesed on the frontline and a PC was earned on the counter. Nicholas Budgeon made sure of the chance with a straight low drag. Losing steam. The Indian defence unable to match the sustained pace of the Australians began to open up and in the 27th minute, Jason Wilson found himself unmarked next to the goal with a cross from 25 metres available. PR Sreejesh had left the goal two early and Wilson was able to dodge past him and level things. A few seconds from half time, India lost all advantage when Glen Turner flicked in a pass from the right flag area. India were fading fast and the break did nothing to revive them. Indeed the second half saw them completely outplayed. Russell Ford extended the lead to 4-2 in the 41st minute. Simon Orchard smashed home from the top of the corner to cap off a counter four minutes later. Ford made it 6-2 when he tapped in a short backpass from Turner. In between the carnage India had a couple of chances of their own. Walmiki only had Australia keeper between him and his second goal in the 48th minute but his shot was directed straight at the rushing Bazelyís midsection. India earned a PC right after Walmikiís miss, but VR Raghunathís strike was wide. Australia rounded off the their scoreline when Joss Whedon pounced on a free hit deflection in the 65th minute. In other matches England set up a semifinal clash against Holland. England beat Belgium 1-0 while Netherlands edged a lacklustre Germany 2-1 in another quarterfinal. New Zealand recovered after captain Dean Couzins missed a penalty stroke to make the semis after beating Argentina in sudden death on penalties after their match ended 1-1.",Hockey World League: India hit Australian wall | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/hockey/india-hit-australian-wall/
85,"HONG KONG: Move over, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Step aside, Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda. When it comes to monetary stimulus, Zhou Xiaochuan, the longtime governor of the People's Bank of China, has no rivals. The latest data released by China on Wednesday shows that the country's rapid growth in money supply has continued. Zhou and his colleagues at the Chinese central bank have only begun the difficult and dangerous task of reining it in. The amount of money sloshing around China's economy, according to a broad measure that is closely watched here, has now tripled since the end of 2006. China's tidal wave of money has powered the economy to new heights but it has also helped drive asset prices through the roof. Housing prices have soared, feeding fears of a bubble while leaving many ordinary Chinese feeling poor and left out. There are big differences, of course, between China and the major Western industrial powers. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to prevent deflation and help their economies recover from the lingering consequences of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. They have little reason to fear inflation. The mechanics of China's monetary policy stimulus are also different from the Fed's quantitative easing. The Fed has been effectively creating money by buying bonds and other securities. The People's Bank of China has been creating money to a considerable extent by issuing more renminbi to bankroll its purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in currency markets to minimize the appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar and keep Chinese exports inexpensive in foreign markets. Moreover, the rapidly expanding money supply reflects a flood of loans from the banking system and the so-called shadow banking system that have kept afloat many inefficient state-owned enterprises and bankrolled the construction of huge overcapacity in the manufacturing sector. Cao Maolan, a real estate broker in Nanjing in east-central China, helped a young woman buy her first apartment seven years ago, a 650-square-foot unit for which she paid the equivalent of $60,000. The young woman sold the apartment in less than two years for a 50 percent profit, Cao said, and has traded up to a bigger apartment every year since then, now living in a 2,150-square-foot apartment for which she paid $985,000, mostly in cash with the profits from previous deals. ""Everyone who bought property has done really well,"" Cao said. But young college graduates, whose numbers have quintupled in the past decade as China's universities expand rapidly, worry that they may never be able to afford to buy a new home. Zheng Yilong, a 22-year-old college graduate in Wuhan, an industrial hub of 10 million people in central China, is paid $575 a month in a low-level banking job with limited opportunities for raises. But he has found that even a 540-square-foot apartment on the outer edge of the metropolitan area, with a long commute, costs $98,400, or 14 years' pay. ""I cannot even begin to imagine how I can earn and save enough to buy even a small unit here in Wuhan, so I don't think about it - there is no solution,"" he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. The money supply and credit data released Wednesday morning show that the central bank has begun to tackle the problem, but only slowly. The broad measure of money supply, known as M2, grew 13.6 percent last year, barely less than its increase of 13.8 percent a year earlier, the Chinese central bank said in a news release. This means the money supply is still charging well ahead of inflation-adjusted economic growth, which has been about 7.6 percent; the exact figure for the fourth quarter of last year is scheduled for release Monday. Growth in M2 almost reached 30 percent at the end of 2009, when China was using monetary policy to offset the effects of the global financial crisis. China has reduced the pace of money supply growth since then, but kept it well above the pace of economic growth throughout, which means it has done little to sop up the extra cash issued during the crisis. The question now is whether the central bank can further slow the growth of credit and the money supply without causing a slump in housing prices or a sharp slowdown in the credit-dependent corporate sector. Even the very modest slowdown in money supply growth so far has already contributed to two sharp but short-lived increases in interbank interest rates in June and December, which roiled markets in China and around the world. China's central bank ""is in a very difficult situation; it needs to tighten but the whole system is not used to tightening, they are used to money printing,"" said Shen Jianguang, a China monetary economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank. M2 encompasses money in circulation, checking accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. It is the main money supply indicator watched by the People's Bank of China in trying to balance the need for economic growth with the dangers of inflation. M2 has grown so fast in China not just because the central bank has been issuing a lot of renminbi but also because the state-owned banking system has lent and relent those renminbi with encouragement from the government, creating a multiplier effect. China has also undergone a financial liberalization in the past five years that has accelerated the pace of lending. An extensive and loosely regulated shadow banking system has emerged, partly because of the willingness of regulators to allow banks to classify loans to new financing companies not as corporate loans but as interbank loans, for which little capital needs to be reserved. The Federal Reserve pays little attention to money supply measures, because they do not provide much guidance to setting monetary policy. While the Fed's ultra-low interest rates and extra monetary stimulus have helped revive the housing market and lifted the stock market, the broadly measured money supply has increased more slowly in the United States because American banks have been much more cautious about lending money. Consumer inflation has not yet become a big problem in China: Falling commodity prices and widespread manufacturing overcapacity held down consumer inflation to 2.6 percent last year. But asset price inflation, notably the country's soaring real estate prices and corresponding decline in housing affordability, has been a constant worry for the authorities.",China dwarfs US; money sloshing around China's economy tripled since 2006 - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/china-dwarfs-us-money-sloshing-around-chinas-economy-tripled-since-2006/articleshow/28879166.cms
86,"Last June, Facebook released a tracking pixel, a snippet of code that allows advertisers to track customers who come to their websites from Facebook ads. For Amy Norman , co-chief executive officer of Little Passports, the pixel was a game-changer. Norman, whose San Francisco company sends children a monthly package to introduce them to geography and history, began testing ads on Facebook to see which ones brought in more customers. In June, Little Passports spent about $30,000 on Facebook ads and the company's revenue for the month was about $130,000. By the end of the year, the company's monthly advertising spending on Facebook had grown to as much as $150,000 and its revenue for December was $700,000. Norman acknowledged that $150,000 was a huge amount of money to spend on advertising in a month for a company with annual revenue of just under $2 million, but she said ""we also tripled our customer base in six months."" The tracking pixel is one of several changes Facebook has made to its advertising tools in recent months. Advertisers can now specify objectives like increasing traffic to a website, encouraging more ""likes"" or converting more sales. They can choose whether their ads appear in Facebook's ""news feed"" or in a column on the far right of its pages. And they can target demographics they want to reach more precisely. Facebook acknowledges it made the changes, at least in part, because while it has more than 25 million small businesses active on its site, only a million or so advertise there. By contrast, Google's AdWords program, which shows users ads related to specific searches they have entered, has become a small-business staple - although some small businesses say they have been priced out of the market. Jeff Gibbard, president of True Voice Media, an agency in Philadelphia that devises social media strategies for small and medium-size businesses, said Facebook was ""clearly trying to position this as an alternative to Google AdWords, but the difference is that activity on Facebook is very passive."" ""You're being shown ads based on things you put in your profile potentially years ago,"" he said. ""You aren't actively looking for a product or service."" For any business, of course, the objective is to sell something. Facebook now offers different routes to that objective. Josh Brown, who owns Far North Kennel in Anchorage with his wife, Theresa Sheldon, focuses on likes, and Far North now has more than 64,000. ""Most of my likes are from women that love dogs,"" said Brown, whose kennel breeds German shepherd puppies and had revenue of close to $100,000 in 2013. ""When their friends start thinking about getting a dog, these women say, 'Have you seen this Facebook page?' That's what drives sales."" In addition to sales, Mario Brown, owner of Royal Internet Marketing and co-owner of MobileBizBox, both online marketing companies based in Oceanside, Calif., focuses on lead generation. When users click on an ad, Brown said, they should be sent to a lead-capture page first and then on to the company's website. ""Get their name and email,"" he said. ""If you capture their information, you can follow up even if they don't purchase anything this time."" Facebook users spend most of their time in the site's news feed. That is where you will find promoted posts, ads that look like other posts but are labeled ""sponsored."" Gibbard of True Voice Media said that people generally recognized that these posts were ads but clicked on them anyway. ""They are in the same stream as other content, so the ads feel more native,"" he said. Little Passports has been running an ad for several months that features a photo of the company's Explorer Kit, with text that encourages readers to subscribe. Norman said the ad had attracted more than 1,500 user-generated comments - comments, she said, that were overwhelmingly positive and lent credibility to an emerging brand. The ads that run on the right side of a Facebook page are more recognizable as paid advertisements. Their click-through rates are generally lower than those for ads in the news feed, and they are not even shown to mobile users. Gibbard calls them ""completely useless."" But some businesses say the ads can be effective. Paola Bottero, chef and owner of Paola's, an Italian restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side with annual revenue of more than $5 million, used right-column ads to increase her lunch business. Bottero created ads with photos of a summer salad and the outdoor terrace dining area, and text like ""Paola's Patio now open!"" She targeted people over 35 living in 10 ZIP codes around Paola's. Over four weeks, Bottero spent just $250 to run the ads in the right column of the targeted Facebook pages, according to Wendy Weinstein Karp of W2K Consulting in Larchmont, N.Y., which handles marketing for Paola's. Karp said the ads reached more than 12,000 people, with 482 visiting the restaurant's Facebook page through the link. ""That's a 3.966 percent click-through rate,"" she said. ""In digital advertising, the average is closer to 1 percent."" For a physical business like a restaurant, it can be difficult to determine how many Facebook visitors actually become customers. But Bottero said she could tell when the restaurant, which has 80 seats, was busier than usual. Right after the campaign, she said, she saw an increase in lunch customers, and many said they had seen the ad on Facebook. Josh Brown of Far North Kennel ran an ad with a photo of puppies that asked, ""Do you love puppies?"" He ran it in both the news feed and the right column, but found the right column more effective. ""The click-through rate is higher for ads in the news feed, but the reach is smaller,"" he said, ""For that one in the news feed, it was shown to 909 people, as opposed to being shown to 640,134 for the ad on the right. I'd rather have 0.75 percent of 640,000 people click through than 1.25 percent of 900 people."" Business owners who create ads on Facebook are asked to choose an audience for their ads, based on characteristics like gender, interests, location, relationship status, education and even whether the user owns an Android device or is expecting a child. Norman, who founded Little Passports along with Stella Ma, uses a new Facebook tool, Custom Audiences, to try to reach mothers who, for example, have a specific educational background or read particular magazines. Norman also uses Facebook's Lookalike Audiences tool, which helps her find potential customers with characteristics similar to those of existing customers. She uploads an Excel file with customer emails and Facebook looks for demographic and behavioral trends within that group, then creates a new list with similar characteristics. Facebook says it protects the privacy of individual users by ""hashing"" their user IDs so that no personal customer information is revealed. Some business owners use targeting to zero in on their markets . When Tiago Forte's San Francisco startup, GSD.LAB, began offering a workflow design and productivity class on Skillshare in October, he guessed that his market would be young men interested in maximizing their productivity. He ran 16 different ads in Facebook's news feed over 24 hours, spending a total of $174 for the campaigns - and found that women were twice as likely to click on his ads as men.",Facebook revamps its advertising tools to compete with Google - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/facebook-revamps-its-advertising-tools-to-compete-with-google/articleshow/28879200.cms
87,"NEW DELHI: In a move that has been welcomed by environmental activists, the Millennium Bus Depot , constructed as a temporary structure on the Yamuna river bank during the 2010 Commonwealth Games , will be shifted out. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that the government would clear its stand on the controversial depot before the high court through an affidavit. The case will come up for a hearing on Thursday. The CM also announced that no further construction would be allowed on the river bed. Kejriwal stressed that it was not just a question of safeguarding the environment but also the important issue of ensuring that the city's natural resources are protected. ""It is a catchment area for water which cannot be meddled with,"" he said. ""We are extremely happy with this decision,"" said Manoj Mishra, convenor of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan. ""The earlier government had let us down on this issue. The new chief minister is at least serious about environmental issues and we hope that the river bed will be left in its original condition."" Sources said among the options that are being considered for relocating the depot is Millennium Park across the road. That, of course, gives rise to the question whether this beautifully landscaped park which came up on a landfill site will have to be relocated too. The announcement marks a complete departure from the stance of the Sheila Dikshit government, which had in fact gone against its own earlier recommendation and that of then LG, Tejinder Khanna, to remove the depot within two weeks of it being set up. It had insisted that it needed the land and had no intension of vacating it. In 2013, more than two years after creating the depot, Delhi Development Authority started the process of changing its land use from the existing Zone 'O' , river and water body, to transportation. This is bad news for Delhi Transport Corporation though, admitted officials. ""To build another depot with the same facilities will be difficult ,"" said an official. It is particularly hard as the DTC has not been finding it easy to get space from DDA to set up more depots. ""The fleet has increased in size but depot space remains the same. Some DTC depots are also being used by cluster buses on a temporary basis. Land is scarce in Delhi and taking away one of the best depots from DTC will prove detrimental to the corporation's functioning,"" added the official. Millennium Depot is one of the biggest depots that the DTC operates at present. Spread over 60 acres, the depot houses four units within the complex. These four depots in turn park 800 low-floor busesó the single depot to have so many low-floor buses. Said a senior DTC official : ""The low-floor buses need special sheds as the space required is more. Special workshops were constructed for this purpose within Millennium Depot."" Besides the buses, the depot also has four CNG filling stations , workshops, ETP, automated washing plants and air-inflation plants.

As the legend goes, Mossí career first began when she was scouted at JFK Airport at the wee age of 14. However, things didnít really take off until she posed for the late Corinne Day for the July 1990 issue of ìThe Faceî magazine. The raw, somewhat scandalous shots of the 16-year-old kewpie (she went topless in one photo, completely nude in another) caught the eye of Fabian Baron, art director extraordinaire and the creative force behind Calvin Klein, and the rest is fashion history. The Calvin Klein campaigns. ìShe has this childlike, womanlike thing. Itís a kind of sexiness that I think is very exciting,î Calvin Klein told People magazine in 1992. That sexiness sparked a lot of controversy when, in the spring of 1993, bare-bones images of the stick-thin siren hit magazines and billboards and incited the rise of the anti-supermodel ó featherweight beauties who looked liked emaciated versions of Amazons, such as Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista. Ads showing a topless Moss straddling a shirtless Mark Wahlberg (nÈ Marky Mark) only fueled the fuss. ìItís just because I look 12,íí Moss told People, and thus began the era of ìheroin chic.î Kate & Johnny. Moss and Depp, from left, in 1995, February 1997, and May 1997. Photo: WireImage; WireImage; AP. The í70s had Sid and Nancy, but in the í90s it was all about Johnny (Depp) and Kate. From 1994 until 1998, they were among the best-known (and outright infamous) couples in Hollywood. Rumor has it the two once filled the tub of a London hotel with champagne for a dip. But glamorous gossip aside, the pairing yielded very real photo moments ó including a famed 1994 photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz ó that will live forever in our style-obsessed hearts (and even longer on Tumblr). A career comeback. In 2005, Moss faced a p.r. nightmare when she was caught on camera allegedly using cocaine. One particularly damning photo ran on the cover of the Daily Mirror, and Moss was dropped by high-profile brands like Burberry, Chanel and H&M almost immediately. Sad times. Fortunately, Mossís longtime agent Sarah Doukas (the one who discovered her at JFK) stepped in and did some major damage control. ìI basically just spent a lot of time on the phone trying to reassure her big clients that you canít believe everything you read,î Doukas told Radio 4ís Desert Island Discs. ìAnd, unfortunately, all press actually is good press in this world we live in. So keep calm, donít have a knee-jerk reaction.î The sweet talk worked, apparently, since she not only got those clients back , but doubled her earnings. As of last year, Moss is the fourth highest paid model in the world. Bam! McQueen makes Kate a hologram. At the end of his fall/winter 2006 Paris show, amid Mossí drug scandal, Alexander McQueen staged a technical feat that saw the model projected as a hologram inside a glass pyramid. As Sarah Mower wrote for Style.com, ìHer blonde hair and pale arms trailing in a dream-like apparition of fragility and beauty that danced for a few seconds, then shrank and dematerialized into the ether.î McQueen then took his bow wearing a T-shirt decorated with the slogan ìWe Love You, Kate!î Visually exquisite and emotionally compelling, the showís moment is arguably the best seen from both Moss and the late great designer himself.

British contemporary artist Marc Quinn turned Moss into an icon quite literally in 2006 when he revealed ìSphinx,î a bronze sculpture of Moss contorted into a complicated yoga position. According to Quinn, the representation is meant to convey ìa mirror of ourselves, a knotted Venus of our age,î and since then the artist has made numerous studies of Moss, which are housed in museums and galleries across the globe.

The modelís nighttime antics are legendary, but her finest came in 2007 at the V&A Golden Age of Couture gala. Moss arrived at the London event in a 1940s Christian Dior dress .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. and stumbled out of the fÍte in one of her own design . The floor-length vintage gown, which had torn at some point during the night, got expertly tied into a bow and made into a mini dress. It looked even better than it did before, and embodied perfectly Mossí uncanny mix of ingenuity, irreverence and style. Holy smokes! Speaking of irreverence, how about the time Moss smoked a cig on the runway? Yep, that happened. After a three-year break from modeling, the model made a surprise appearance for her friend Marc Jacobs and walked in his Louis Vuitton fall/winter 2011 Paris show. Though the casting included all-stars like Naomi Campbell, Amber Valletta and Carolyn Murphy, it was Kate who stole the show ó her bad habit paired with hot pants and bondage-style boots .

The chiffon number was simple, sophisticated, and a perfect emblem for the ceremony at large, which was held at the Moss homestead in the Cotswolds, England. ìI wanted it to be kind of dreamy and 1920s, when everything is soft-focus,î Moss told Vogue.

89,"Michael Dell spent much of the last year fighting a highly public and nasty battle with the likes of activist investor Cark Icahn , to take the company he founded private. Having achieved that goal in a landmark $24.9-billion transaction with the help of private equity firm Silver Lake and a bunch of investors, the entrepreneur is now busy transforming Dell Inc into an one stop shop for enterprises. The 48-year old, who founded the firm in a college dorm nearly three decades ago, spoke with ET on the privatisation process, Dell's transformation and his increased focus on India. Excerpts: How did the idea of privatisation take shape? An executive from Silver Lake approached me and said ""hey, I think you should consider taking the company private"". It was not the first time I had thought about that idea. But I listened carefully, asked a bunch of questions. Later, I asked an executive from another private equity firm if they thought it would be possible to take Dell private and he said ""yes, and in fact we would like to talk to you about it"". I said ""well, I better stop and call my lawyer , because this is a very complicated thing and has to be controlled by the independent board"". Then very quickly I informed the board of my interest and asked them for permission to explore this. What was the logic behind taking Dell private? Privatisation will allow us to be bold, we can think about our business in a different way, we can build this 100% on our customers, and we can do this long term. That is pretty different from a public company. It has unleashed an enormous amount of excitement with our teams and partners as well. Customer interest has been strong and we have had great growth in our business since announcing the completion of the privatisation. We are doing everything we said we would do so that is good for the long term. Emerging markets are a big priority because that is where the next billion users will come from. What about the huge debt on the balance sheet on account of privatisation and the accompanying risks? You know, I generally believe that we did not really take on any new risks. Our capital structure is better as a private company than what it was as a public company. It costs us less. We spent between $1.7 billion and $2 billion a year with share repurchases, dividends and interest as a public company. We spend quite a bit less as a private company. We are aggressively paying down our debts so our capital structure is preferred. We have flexibility and the interest rate environment is very favourable. We can invest for the long term, which is a real privilege that most companies do not have. Our competitors are all beholden to the short term demands from shareholders. Listen in on the conference calls of our competitors and you hear shareholders ask ""what about earnings this quarter?"". I did that for 25 years. All done with that, thank you very much. I will pay not to have to do that. Privatisation just gives us an enormous amount of freedom to execute in the way we believe is the right way and that is for me incredibly energizing.",Privatisation allows us to be bold: Michael Dell - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/privatisation-allows-us-to-be-bold-michael-dell/articleshow/28859482.cms
90,"NEW DELHI: An investigation of sexual harassment charges levelled by an intern against Justice Swatanter Kumar , now the National Green Tribunal chief, will be on hold for now, till the top court figures out a mechanism to deal with such complaints against judicial officers, whether sitting or retired. At the outset, the court questioned the intern's delay in filing the complaint. The alleged instances of harassment date back to May, 2011. Chief Justice P Sathasivam sought to know the reasons for the delay in filing the complaint in view of the fact that the ""intern was a law graduate and reported the incidents to her parents and teachers the same day"". ""What is the explanation for the delay,"" he asked the intern's lawyer Harish N Salve . Responding, Salve pointed out that there was no ""institutional mechanism"" to deal with such complaints. The CJI then raised a practical problem in dealing with belated complaints. ""Our grievance is why she waited to file her complaint. There are so many retired judges. If you complain after 20 years can we call a judge at 80, 85 (years) and question him?"" Salve, however, defended the delay on the ground that there was no mechanism under which she could have complained. There could be a period within which a person could complain or forever hold her silence, he said. In the interest of the institution, Salve said, it would have to be a system based on ""secrecy"" which would make any breach of such secrecy ""actionable"". The CJI, sitting alongside Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Shiva Kirti Singh , agreed to examine these issues and issued notices to Justice Kumar, the Centre and the Attorney General. He also appointed senior members of the bar, senior advocates Fali S Nariman and PP Rao, to help the court come up with a mechanism that would cover all judicial officers, whether holding such office or retired. The court gave all parties to submit their formal views to the court on this aspect within four weeks. The case will now come up for further hearing on Feb 17, 2014. The intern had alleged that Justice Kumar had harassed her prompting her to leave her internship within days. However, her complaint was rejected by the Chief Justice, citing a full court decision (all judges sting together) in the Justice A.K. Ganguly case not to deal with more complaints against retired judges. Justice Ganguly had to step down as West Bengal Human Rights Commission chairman after similar allegations were made against him by another intern. A panel of three top court judges which examined the charges found a prima facie case against him but did not go further citing lack of jurisdiction over retired judges. But the renewed furore caused by the second intern's allegations and her decision to challenge the Dec 5, 2013, full court decision, forced he court order, however, made it clear that it was not going into the merits of her complaint against Justice Swatanter Kumar, effectively giving him a breather of sorts till a complaint redressal mechanism was in place while deflecting any criticism of inaction on this front. The NGT chief would also have an additional safeguard -- his complaint might be heard in-camera, with no fear of any leaks, unless of course, the intern was unhappy with the action and decided to further challenge its findings.",Supreme Court puts intern sexual harassment probe on hold - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/supreme-court-puts-intern-sexual-harassment-probe-on-hold/articleshow/28867261.cms
91,"KOLKATA: Little did Chennai-based engineer Priyanka Sachdev realise that after spending a shade below 25,000 for a five-star rated refrigerator - the most energy efficient - last Diwali, it would turn out to be a not-so-energy efficient model this year. She was not told by the salesman that energy efficiency rating norms would be revised from 2014, turning a five-star refrigerator into a three-star one from January. Sachdev is among millions of consumers who suffer a notional loss after paying a premium to buy an energy-efficient appliance, with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) upgrading the standards every two years. BEE is the nodal body under the Union power ministry that implements energy rating norms. This increases the obsolescence rate and drives prices up by 10-15%, companies said. For instance, Sachdev's refrigerator became obsolete in three months. In effect, it has become an unending chase for consumers to save more on power consumption by purchasing energy-efficient models. This may soon change with India's appliance and consumer electronic energy rating system set to become more consumer-friendly. BEE plans to replace the present system of biennial changes in rating standards with one that lasts longer to reduce the rate of obsolescence for an energy-efficient model. The agency also plans to include televisions and geysers from this year under mandatory energy ratings, which now includes only frost-free refrigerators, air-conditioners and tube lights. ""The present system of upgrading energy rating norms every two years was prevalent till the latest change effective this calendar year as per what we had decided six years ago and hence will now be evaluated,"" said BEE director general Ajay Mathur . ""Now that Indian energy rating norms are at par with global standards and consumers value energy-efficient products, we can continue with the rating standards for a longer period such as four years,"" he said. BEE will soon start consultations with manufacturers, testing labs and consumer rights groups to decide the road map for white goods energy rating norms. Mathur said the agency had initially decided on a gradual increase of rating norms every two years since a severe tightening would have increased product prices significantly, which would have been a burden for consumers.",BEE plans to revise energy rating norms at longer intervals for electronic goods - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/cons-products/electronics/bee-plans-to-revise-energy-rating-norms-at-longer-intervals-for-electronic-goods/articleshow/28857617.cms
92,"A place setting and menus are seen at a table in the Nitehawk Cinema in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, where a meal is served as the film is projected. Photo: Getty Images. Coming soon to an NYC neighborhood near you is a new kind of movie theater. Specifically, one that serves booze and gourmet food. Movie houses with drinking and dining options, including the Florida-based iPic, the Texas-based Alamo Drafthouse and Williamsburgís Nitehawk, are gearing up to expand throughout the city. ìOur research showed 78 percent of people eat before or after going to the movies,î said iPic president and CEO Hamid Hashemi. The idea of combining dining, drinking and cinema options is yet another way to lure movie-goers away from their Netflix accounts. Late last year it was announced that iPic, a luxe movie chain with eight theaters across the country, was opening a 46,000-square-foot, eight-screen auditorium at 11 Fulton St. at the South Street Seaport in 2015. The theater promises waiter service (at iPic the waiters are called ìninjasî who stealthily leave your food and drink orders during the show), as well as leather chairs, some of which fully recline and come with blankets. The seating area of the iPic theater complex planned for South Street Seaport. Photo: iPic. But, it turns out, this downtown theater is the tip of the iceberg as far as iPicís New York designs go. Faith Hope Consolo of Douglas Elliman noted that iPic is looking to expand throughout the city: ìTheyíre looking in Long Island City where thereís [few movie options]; theyíre looking in Downtown Brooklyn; theyíre looking in [other parts of] Queens and Upper Manhattan. Manhattan proper has a lot of theaters, but upper Manhattan does not. It would be a great addition to the Harlem landscape.î According to Hashemi, ìThere are three other sites in New York that weíre working on.î Already scheduled for 2015 is a 541-seat iPic theater in Fort Lee, NJ. And if iPic lands a spot in Brooklyn, theyíre going to find competition from Alamo Drafthouse. Alamo, which also serves a full menu of food and beverage, inked a deal to open in City Point, the 1 million-square-foot retail outlet thatís debuting sometime next year in Downtown Brooklyn. ìWeíre going to be on the top floor,î said Tim League, founder and CEO of Alamo. ìItíll be 800 seats.î The new iPic theater complex planned for South Street Seaport. Photo: iPic. And Alamo has already struck the New York market with a six-screen, 550-seat theater that they opened last August in Yonkers. ìThe neighborhood has been reacting well,î said League. ìThereís always challenges, but so far so good. We had a really nice holiday season and attendance has been up.î League says that heís currently on the lookout for more Alamo spots in Manhattan ó although one deal that Alamo had in the works to take over the Metro theater on the Upper West Side fell through. The pioneer of this movie/dining/drinking trend in NYC was the Nitehawk Cinema, which opened in 2011. It offered atypical cinema fare (fried calamari, meatballs), as well as handcrafted cocktails. (Many of the dishes and cocktails complement the movies being screened ó like blue cheese fondue and Blue Point winter ale to go with a screening of ìBlue is the Warmest Color.î) The Nitehawk helped rewrite the laws that had been on the books forbidding alcohol in movie theaters. The seating area of the Nitehawk Cinema in Williamsburg. Photo: Zandy Mangold. ìWe met a lobbyist who thought it was a good idea,î said Matthew Viragh, the founder, executive director of the Nitehawk. ìHe drummed up a lot of support, and they were able to change the law. In August of 2011 Governor Cuomo signed it.î The change might help explain why there is a sudden explosion in these sorts of venues. Nitehawk is also ó surprise, surprise! ó on the lookout for new venues. ìWeíre very interested in other neighborhoods in New York,î said Viragh. ìOur goal for the next year or two is to identify areas of expansion .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. we are actively searching in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens ó all over.î Certainly, this is a happy turn of events for moviegoers. ìRevenue has been droppingî industry-wide, said iPicís Hashemi. ìWe have to come up with new ways of getting people to the theater.î ìAs people get more and more access to movies at home, the response to that is to make the movies more like home ó with things like better food,î said Viragh. ìThe idea of adding food and drink makes for an efficient night out,î added League. ìAt a higher level, it makes the experience really fun ó it becomes a celebration of movies.î",Movie theaters with dining options on the rise in NYC | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/movie-theaters-with-dining-options-on-the-rise-in-the-city/
93,"From craft beer to cranberry bitters, pickled scapes to truffled mayo ó if itís a fancy foodstuff, itís probably being made in Brooklyn. Now hopping on the boroughís artisanal bandwagon are small-batch distillers, who are producing local whiskey, rum and other spirits all along the East River. Daric Schlesselman, owner of the Van Brunt Stillhouse, in front of drums used to age whiskey at his factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Photo: Lorenzo Ciniglio. Itís a rapidly growing industry with around a dozen distillers setting up shop in Kings County over the past two years ó thanks to the efforts of then governor Eliot Spitzer, who lifted certain restrictions on manufacturing alcohol in 2007, and is continuing with current Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has allotted millions to promote state-produced spirits. One of the biggest clusters of distilleries is in Red Hook, a gentrifying neighborhood that still retains industrial zones allowing for light manufacturing. Itís where Van Brunt Stillhouse owner Daric Schlesselman and his wife and business partner, Sarah Ludington, both live and work. ìWe moved to Red Hook 10 years ago, and when we decided to start the business, we wanted to have it near to where we live,î said Schlesselman, whose distillery produces whiskey, rum and grappa. ìAnd secondly, we wanted to be part of the larger community.î That community includes fellow distillers Cacao Prieto (rum and liqueur) and Jack From Brooklyn (a hibiscus liqueur called Sorel), along with Sixpoint Brewery. It didnít hurt that when Schlesselman signed the lease on the 6,000-square-foot Bay Street space in summer 2011, ìthere was a lull in commercial real estate,î he said. ìI was able to backload my lease with a rate of $12 per foot.î Thatís a bargain, considering that rents for industrial space in Red Hook have skyrocketed. ìThe average is now $15 to $20 per foot for industrial space in Red Hook,î said Christopher Havens, commercial director of Aptsandlofts.com. ìAnd for the kind of space distillers need ó small-industrial, ground-floor ó itís really hard to find. Iíve never seen the market this tight.î In nearby Gowanus, prices for such spaces are even greater: ìIíve seen it go as high as $22 per foot,î said Havens. For that reason, many distillers have chosen to head farther south, to Sunset Park ó like the young team behind Industry Standard vodka. They decided to locate in Industry City ó part of the gigantic Bush Terminal industrial park that stretches along the waterfront between 39th and 53rd Streets. ìWe were looking at a number of spaces ó in Gowanus, Bushwick, Greenpoint ó expensive spaces in ugly warehouse buildings with no windows,î recalled Peter Simon, head of sales and outreach of the company, which includes distiller Dave Kyrejko and machinist Zachary Bruner. ìThen we went to take a look at Industry City, with its huge windows, beautiful views and the express subway stop at 36th Street and we were like, ëWow, where do we sign?í î Distiller and co-owners of Industry City Distillery, from left, Peter Simon, Zac Bruner and David Kyrejko in front of the Bio Reactor used for Fermentation.

The company started with 6,000 square feet at around $7.50 to $9 a foot in September of 2011 and recently doubled their amount of space. ìThere are huge advantages to being [in Industry City],î said Simon. ìThe new management offers a variety of different spaces. There are lots of young, innovative businesses here. I see a long-term future in this building . . . I just could never imagine leaving Brooklyn.î Brad Estabrooke, the founder and owner of Breuckelen Distilling, now in its fourth year of making whiskey and gin, also set up shop in Sunset Park. Back in 2009, when Estabrooke first toured the 2,250-square-foot space ó in an industrial area wedged between the BQE and the Gowanus Canal ó he knew it was perfect. ìThe space was beautiful, amazing light, with the high [16-foot] ceilings we needed for a distillery,î he said. ìIt was also the cheapest space I had seen, so it was an easy choice.î Estabrooke signed the lease in August of that year ó and just renewed it for another five years at $14.50 a foot. ìI chose to do this in Brooklyn because I like all the independent, craft businesses that are here,î he said. ìAnd I want to be someplace where people support urban producers.î Yet the size of the space did become an issue. ìIt takes many years and a lot of space to age whiskey,î explained Estabrooke, who will produce about 2,000 cases this year. ìI needed 1,000 square feet [for storage], and I didnít want to pay more than $15,000 a month.î He searched for two years ó and even considered storing it upstate ó before finding affordable warehouse space in East New York. ìUpstate, the product would have been out of reach,î Estabrooke said. ìThis way I can keep everything in Brooklyn.î",South Brooklyn distilleries produce with local passion | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/south-brooklyn-distilleries-brew-with-local-passion/
94,"Related. Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko scored twice each as Premier League high-fliers Manchester City comprehensively quashed second tier Blackburn Roversí hopes of causing an FA Cup shock with an emphatic 5-0 third-round replay win on Wednesday. After being held to a surprising draw 11 days ago, City proved far too strong for Blackburn with Negredo bagging his 20th and 21st goals of the season in two minutes either side of halftime before strike partner Edin Dzeko got in on the act. His two goals came either side of one from Sergio Aguero, who netted a minute after coming on for his first appearance following a month-long injury absence. Last seasonís beaten finalists City will face Watford at home in the fourth round. ìI donít think it was easy,î Dzeko told ITV. ìEspecially, in the first half. ìThe first goal was very important for us as well as the goal at the start of the second half. And as usual we then scored some more.î City fans who expected another goal-scoring procession would have been disappointed by a largely unexciting first half in which Blackburn dug in, with little ambition to break. The hosts made eight changes to their side and while the five-times Cup winners still fielded a stellar cast, without the injured Samir Nasri, string-puller David Silva and powerhouse Yaya Toure they lacked creativity in midfield. Cityís passing and decision-making were sub-standard and chances were scarce before the hosts broke the deadlock in first-half stoppage time. Negredo had been a willing runner up front and was rewarded with his 20th goal of the season, a towering header on the run after Fernandinho had whipped and excellent cross to the far post in a rare moment of quality. The strikerís 21st of the season arrived two minutes after the break, a neat finish from halftime substitute Aleksandar Kolarovís fantastic crossfield pass, with Negredo flicking the ball over Blackburnís advancing keeper with the outside of his left boot. Dzekoís first goal on 67 minutes made the game safe and was an equally stylish finish with the Bosnia striker swivelling in the area to rifle Jesus Navasís near post cross into the top corner. City are not in need of striking reinforcements, but Aguero came off the bench to bolster the attacking options and found the net immediately with a low finish before Dzeko added the final flourish with another near-post effort 10 minutes from time. City, who took their goalscoring tally to 99 for the season, are still competing on four fronts and Dzeko feels they are stronger than when they won the Premier League title in 2012. ìWe have a few more world-class players, like Fernandinho, (Jesus) Navas and Negredo. Of course that is why we are better,î he said. ìWe are still there for four trophies but our target is just to win the next game.î",Five-star Manchester City crush hapless Blackburn Rovers in FA Cup | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/five-star-manchester-city-crush-hapless-blackburn-rovers-in-fa-cup/
95,"Brookfield Properties is investing $4.5 billion in the massive Manhattan West above the Amtrak railyards; it will be a mixed-used project combining office space, residential and retail. Developers can relax ó Mayor Bill de Blasio wonít turn New York City into a communistic realm where no one can build a candy store without including ìaffordableî apartments.

A rendering of the Manhattan West project by Brookfield Properties. Photo: Brookfield Properties. Rose Associates wonít stop its $550 million conversion of 70 Pine St., the former AIG tower, to luxury rental apartments because the new mayor wants to build 100,000 more affordable units citywide. Nor is it likely the new administration will tinker with plans the city previously green-lighted for ambitious projects yet to break ground ó such as the humanely scaled, mixed-use Essex Crossing, between Delancey and Broome Streets. It doesnít mean the cityís new leadership doesnít spell a change in the development climate ó of course it does. But contrary to fears, it may be more incremental than revolutionary. Less jittery dealmakers can take comfort in the fact that as a city council member and as public advocate, de Blasio was no knee-jerk anti-development advocate, but more of a pragmatist. He voted for Forest City Ratnerís Atlantic Yards proposal and for several major up-zonings. His decision to keep Bloombergís Economic Development Corp. president Kyle Kimball is a welcome sign of continuity. There are enough fully entitled, publicly approved mega-projects underway to keep the tower cranes busy for four more years ó no matter what policies City Hall adopts ó and to advance the Bloomberg-era vision far into the future. Among them: the World Trade Center, Hudson Yards, Atlantic Yards, the Cornell-Technion biotech campus on Roosevelt Island and the Empire Outlets on Staten Island. The plan for the $850 million, mixed-use Flushing Commons complex in Queens was approved by the city nearly four years ago. It, too, is untouchable now that the developers closed in December on the site purchase. Large projects such as Silverstein Propertiesí 82-story, 30 Park Place hotel/condo tower and Durst Fetnerís ìpyramidî on West 57th Street similarly can continue to go up on schedule. Brookfieldís $4.5 billion Manhattan West office/residential/retail plan atop the Amtrak rail yards between Ninth and 10th Avenues has yet to sign up tenants but also has necessary approvals in place, and construction of a deck over the yard is well underway. But it could be another story for jumbo enterprises, which have only begun to pass through the cityís Uniform Land Use Review Procedure ó notably Two Trees Managementís $1.5 billion mixed-use complex planned at the former Domino Sugar plant site in Brooklyn. And although tax breaks have been approved for the first phase of the $3 billion Willets Point project in Queens, its developers will still need help from City Hall to see it through. The days are likely past, however, for the kind of big-ticket, Bloomberg-era initiatives ó such as city funding for the No. 7 subway extension to Hudson Yards. But de Blasio says he recognizes the need to rezone East Midtown to allow larger new office towers, albeit on different terms than those proposed under Bloomberg ó whose failure to push the measure through before he left office left some ambitious plans in limbo. Developers might also have to work harder with the city to negotiate variances from as-of-right regulations at specific sites. While de Blasio has pledged to ìdemandî that developers create low-cost housing, he has no way to require them to do so in projects requiring no zoning changes, tax incentives or other municipal favors. But he could require more affordable units at sites where developers receive tax-exempt bond financing than those needed under the current 80-20 program. Developers might have to crunch the numbers to see if, say, 75-25 works for them. The prospect of even incremental new rules can be daunting given the number of things that can go wrong ó such as last weekís court ruling to block for now a major part of NYUís expansion. Yet, the overwhelming majority of new projects are built as-of-right. Real Estate Board of New York president Steven Spinola said, ìWe believe fewer than 10 percent have to go through ULURP.î Major AOR projects in recent years include 730 Lexington Ave. ó home to Bloomberg LP, luxury condos, stores and restaurants ó and Boston Propertiesí new office tower at 250 W. 55th St. They include, as well, most of the super-luxury condo towers deplored by Bloombergís critics ó including CIM/Harry Mackloweís fast-rising 432 Park Ave. and Extellís planned 1,424-foot-tall 217 W. 57th St. Some fear that even without statutory changes, ìprogressiveî rhetoric from a mayor more passionate about income inequality than about the cityís world-capital status will have a discouraging effect ó and that de Blasioís words alone could stifle development momentum more than 9/11 and the crash of 2009 temporarily did. But the cityís underlying strengths remain. New Yorkís enduring magnetism continues to attract global wealth and commerce. Massey Knakal chairman Robert Knakal predicted in the Commercial Observer that 2014 will be a banner year for investment-sale volume and prices, topping the record $62 billion worth of properties sold in 2007. Manhattan office availability dipped to a major market low of 10.8 percent, according to Cassidy Turleyís report on a ìmonumentalî fourth quarter. That was despite the completion of 4.1 million square feet of new inventory. The firm also reported Midtown Class-A asking rents topped $80 per square foot for the first time in five years. Numbers like those speak louder than rhetoric. But if de Blasio is as much of a realist as his prior record suggests, developers can look forward to a highly profitable future, even if they sweat a bit for it.",NYC development surge to continue under de Blasio | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/nyc-development-surge-to-continue-under-de-blasio/
96,"When Eric Benaim began brokering apartments in Long Island City, back in 2006, convincing people to move there required imagination. ìI had to paint a picture of what this neighborhood would eventually be like,î he says, recalling how desolate it looked. ìI donít have to do that anymore,î he adds. Today, the East River waterfront brims with sleek high-rises, some of which rival those of Manhattan in grandeur. ìBuildings here have so many amenities, theyíre almost like cruise ships,î says Benaim, founder of the LIC-based brokerage Modern Spaces. Indeed, with everything from screening rooms and roof decks to indoor pools, spas, barbecue pits, outdoor fireplaces and even dog runs, LICís high-end buildings are almost like self-contained cities.

A rental unit inside Gantry Park Landing, a waterfront building packed with amenities including a yoga studio, roof deck and game room with a ping-pong table and Wii. Photo: Travis Dubreuil. ìIn 2005 or 2006, when these buildings first came online, developers had to make their buildings amenity-rich because there was nothing to do in the neighborhood,î says Benaim, who bought his own LIC apartment in 2006. ìNow you still need those amenities just to be competitive here ó even though there are things to do outside of the building.î Whatís most unusual about the neighborhood, however, is that unlike in Manhattan ó or even Brooklyn ó the choicest amenities go to renters rather than buyers. In fact, according to Benaim, 90 percent of the new luxury housing stock in LIC is comprised of rental units. Gantry Park Landing, which opened 18 months ago, is a typically amenity-laden LIC waterfront rental, with a gaming lounge with ping-pong table and Wii-equipped TVs, yoga studio and roof deck. Units at The Maximilian start at $2,180 a month. Studios go for $2,400, one-bedrooms for $3,300 and two-bedrooms fetch $4,100 ó and theyíve rented quickly, appealing to New Yorkers seeking luxury digs without having to pay the prices of prime Brooklyn or Manhattan. ìA couple of weeks ago, we had a dinner to celebrate our Gantry Park Landing being 90 percent full,î says Mitchell Hochberg, president of Manhattan-based Lightstone Group, for which the 199-unit Gantry was their first Long Island City project but not the last, as two more rental buildings are on the way. ìWe went to Alobar restaurant right in the neighborhood, and I felt like I was in Williamsburg.î Theyíre hardly the only big buildings with tricked out amenities: at 4705 Center Blvd. (where rents start at $2,425 according to Streeteasy) the tower has a rooftop pool and massage room. Nearby, another recently launched luxe rental is TF Cornerstoneís 4545 Center Boulevard, which features beach volleyball and tennis courts. The building houses 820 apartments ó of which just 27 units remain; one-bedrooms are priced at $2,800 and three-bedrooms go for $5,300. Demand is so high that many, many more luxury rentals are planned. This year will see another 2,000 freshly built apartments hitting the LIC market, including TF Cornerstoneís 585-unit 4610 Center Boulevard, situated along the river, with an exterior that cantilevers above the Pepsi sign. John McMillan, director of planning for TF Cornerstone, describes it as ìFlorida glass and curving balconies whipping around the corners.î Units are expected to run slightly higher than at 4545 Center Boulevard. Pals over at the house? Stick it to ëem inside the billiards room at amenity-heavy rental 4705 Center Boulevard. Smaller buildings like the 188-unit Maximilian have rents starting at $2,180 have seen prospective tenants filling the showrooms on the weekend. Just off the waterfront, in the rapidly developing ó yet slightly grittier Court Square neighborhood ó is the newly opened Linc, a soaring, 42-story, 709-unit building at 4310 Crescent St. One of several Rockrose developments in LIC, Linc features studios from $2,150, one-bedrooms for $2,600, two-bedrooms for $3,500 and three-bedrooms for $4,800; the jewel of the building, a 1,400-square-foot three-bedroom, with 11-foot ceilings and a wraparound terrace, will hit the market this spring at $5,700. At the moment, five months after the first tenants moved in, 350 apartments remain vacant at Linc. The gigantic Linc building, which sports a wraparound terrace, also has a tenants lounge. Rockrose also owns the nearby building housing the destination cocktail spot Dutch Kills. In an area of burgeoning hipness, a craft drinks joint is a treasure: ìThey help the neighborhood and theyíre good tenants,î says Justin Elghanayan, a partner at Rockrose. When asked if there are plans to upgrade the property, he says, ìWhy would I want them to go?î Along those same lines, when Sarah Obraitis and her French Canadian husband Hugo Dufour lost their lease on M. Wells Diner in Hunters Point in 2011, Elghanayan intended to do everything in his power to keep them in LIC. Understanding the importance of having a destination restaurant in the neighborhood, he even offered a piece of vacant lot where they could plant a food truck. Ultimately, Elghanayan offered the couple a fair, long-term lease in a former auto body shop which they transformed into the buzzy, red-walled M. Wells Steakhouse ó directly across the street from Linc. There are 709 units inside the 42-story Linc residence at 4310 Crescent St. Photo: Brian Zak. Obraitis says that she and her husband were inundated with opportunities to open up in Manhattan or Brooklyn. But they enjoy living in Long Island City and like working close to home. ìWhen you get beyond the high-rises here, the low-scale vibe reminds Hugo of some quarters in Montreal,î says Obraitis, a Queens native. ìOther parts of New York were already being well-served by restaurants. Here, the doors were opening. Rockrose came to us and so did PS 1 [MOMAís LIC satellite where M. Wells maintains a cafÈ]. Long Island City is having its time. The area is ready to seize the moment and seize tenants like us.î In order to keep those tenants, though, Long Island City must deal with its shortage of condos. Indeed, apartments available for purchase currently represent less than 10 percent of the recently constructed stock. But that will soon change. Encouraged by rising condo prices ó in the 48-unit Vista, at 4415 Purves St., square-foot prices jumped from $680 to more than $1,000 this summer ó independent developers are stepping into the condo breach. Indeed, while the TFs and Rockroses of the world stick mostly with rentals ó preferring to realize profits as the neighborhood evolves ó lesser-known developers are taking advantage of LICís condo dearth. Companies like JMJ Contracting and Ascent Development are building on a smaller scale. Construction just began on the so-called Finger Building, a lean 15-unit project at 4277 Hunter St., which is expected to be completed in 2016. Sales commence on Saturday for Ivy28, a Queens Plaza project with 28 units that start at $860 per square foot. By June, LIV@MurrayPark will bring 38 more units, selling for $850 to $900 per square foot. Over the next three years, Benaim expects to see 400 condo units hitting the LIC market. ìWith so many rentals out there and those prices leveling off, more people are doing condos,î he says. ìI see that as the next trend. Thereís currently a lack of condos, thereís demand for them and prices have risen to a point where theyíve never been.î",Long Island City is a rising star in real estate | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/long-island-city-is-a-rising-pop-star/

98,"In 1919, the Montagu Chelmsford reforms introduced dyarchy under which the British Crown retained important subjects like defence, communications, foreign affairs, finance, justice and police, but transferred subjects like sanitation, libraries, veterinary, fisheries, agriculture, weights and measures and forests to elected Indian ministers. After Independence, the delicate balance between state and central governments struck by the Constitution was disrupted by Indira Gandhi - she used Article 356 to dismiss state governments 41 times - and believed that ""strong states would create a weak nation"". So today, only 10% of central assistance to state plans gives them room to evolve their own schemes, instead of the 85% envisaged by the 1969 resolution of the National Development Council. So, almost two-thirds of IAS officers in Delhi work in central ministries on state subjects like agriculture, rural development, panchayati raj, social justice, health and education. Getting skills and jobs for the 10 lakh kids who will join the labour force every month for the next 20 years needs moving labour laws from the concurrent list to the state list of the Constitution. For employment, 28 chief ministers matter more than one prime minister. India's labour laws have toxic consequences. An employment contract that is the equivalent of marriage without divorce means that 100% of net job creation since 1991 has happened in informal jobs and 28% of our labour force is on contract: the global average is 5%. Most of our employers are dwarfs rather than babies: they are small and will stay small. Only 12% of our people work in manufacturing, and our successes are in skill- and capital-intensive sectors, rather than in labour-intensive, garments and electronics assembly. Legally Breaking Labour Law. These laws confiscate 48% of a low-wage worker's salary in poor value-for-money benefits - most people cannot live on half their salary and work informally. Trade union legislation that enables outsiders to drive the agenda is dangerous because of the criminalisation of politics and the politicisation of unions. And, trying to enforce the unenforceable breeds corruption: you can't follow 100% of India's labour laws without violating 10% of them! The emerging policy consensus - recently echoed by Rahul Gandhi - that our labour laws choose the old over the young, must recognise that a national employment or education agenda for reform does too much averaging - all politics and labour markets are local. There is no such thing as India's or Karnataka's labour market; the dynamics of matching, repairing and preparing are different for Bangalore, Mysore, Gulbarga, Hassan and Hospet. There are many reasons for making labour laws a state subject. It will create accountability; Socrates said a slave who has three masters is free. It will allow nuancing and sequencing between employment contracts that balance leverage between employers and employees and definitions, benefits and so on. It will allow for an integrated education, employment and employability strategy that focuses on detail, because states already control most delivery systems like schools, colleges, employment exchanges and ITIs. Bold, brave and brainy chief ministers will shame the laggards because of the demonstration effect under which a positive spiral is created when the behaviour of individuals exposed to the actions of others creates unhappiness with what was previously acceptable. The Chinese Example. China has interesting lessons. Till the early 1990s, local governments collected all of China's tax and passed a portion to the central government in Beijing. But in 1994, Beijing reasserted tax supremacy, and this meant that provinces had to build infrastructure and provide public services with only a fraction of earlier resources. Provinces filled the gap partly by borrowing, but mostly by brutally competing for investors on infrastructure, skills, tax incentives and labour laws, and creating 500 million jobs. When the US was growing at its fastest, it doubled living standards every 30 years. China has doubled its living standards every 10 years for the last 30 years.",India's job emergency needs a solution: Make labour laws a state subject & let CMs compete - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/comments-analysis/indias-job-emergency-needs-a-solution-make-labour-laws-a-state-subject-let-cms-compete/articleshow/28855846.cms
99,"Last week in an upmarket part of Delhi, where apartments sell for crores of rupees, I came across a household where both the poorly paid staff and the owner had voted for Arvind Kejriwal , the engineer-turnedpolitician who has become the new chief minister of Delhi ó India's most urbanised state. This was not an unusual sample by any means. The urban poor toiling at the lowest levels of Delhi's economy preferred Kejriwal, as did the affluent class that longs for a technocratic government and a smoother integration into the global economy. It does indeed seem that a fresh episode in Indian ó and Asian ó politics began with Kejriwal's victory. Rising on a wave of disaffection with the corruption and inefficiency of established political parties, his Aam Aadmi Party adds an Indian dimension to a worldwide phenomenon: the emergence of external challengers ó ranging from Beppe Grillo, a comedian, in Italy to Imran Khan, a sportsman, in Pakistan ó to entrenched political elites. Kejriwal sometimes evokes the chief executives of large cities ó such as Boris Johnson in London ó that stand aloof from their socially and economically backward hinterlands. Presently calculating his chances in the forthcoming national elections, Kejriwal may well follow the example of Turkey's PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, previously mayor of Istanbul, and leapfrog into national politics. The Man in Jakarta But Kejriwal confronts many challenges as an aspiring national politician in a substantially rural country undergoing an extensive and risky urbanisation ó urbanisation that as yet holds little prospect of development or prosperity for a majority of the urbanised. In that sense, his true model is not Johnson, but another Asian politician from nowhere who also sings the glories of decentralisation and advocates ""bottom-up"" governance: Joko Widodo , Jakarta's governor . Widodo, better known as Jokowi, came to politics after a successful career as a businessman, and is his country's most preferred candidate in this year's presidential elections. Along with Surabaya's mayor, Tri Rismaharini, he is a product of the kind of decentralised governance that India is lurching toward and Indonesia has already embraced. Pitted against a heavily centralised state and elite domination of the economy, both Jokowi and Kejriwal are working against the old top-down model of economic growth that opens up massive disparities between the centre and the periphery and rural and urban areas. Many of their supporters belong to the ""floating mass"" of workers from villages. From Thailand to Turkey, liberalised and globalised economies have created new urban middle classes, which in classical modernisation theory have been expected to democratise their countries. But we have yet to take on board the impact of a bigger, much less understood and politically more significant demographic: urban migrants connected to their homes in the hinterland through the flow of remittances, investment, culture and ideas, and steadily politicised with the help of print literacy, electronic media, job mobility and mobile phones. In the metropolis, these first-generation migrants lack the political networks or sturdy ideological loyalties that determine their votes at home; they can be persuaded to vote for anyone who seems to promise relief from corruption and injustice. In many cases ó such as the Anatolian entrepreneurs in Istanbul or rural magnates from Karnataka in Bangalore ó they have accumulated enough power to shape domestic politics, with important continuing effects. The most famous and significant Asian representative of this demographic is, of course, Thaksin Shinawatra . His peculiar ó some might say, malevolent ó political genius was to forge an alliance between the rural and urban poor, who had long been ignored by traditional ruling elites, thus clearing a new space in Thai politics. With its superior voter base in rural northern Thailand, Thaksin's party has, since 2006, routinely provoked an anti-democratic backlash among Bangkok's middle class and royalists. India has quietly undergone an even greater demographic shift than Thailand's: the population census of 2011 revealed a faster rate of urbanisation than any of the previous decades. To take one example: mobile phone subscribers grew from 45 million in 2002 to almost a billion in 2012. The rural can no longer be seen in isolation from the urban, except in very remote areas. It is in this fast-altering landscape that Kejriwal's party has arrived. But Kejriwal's advent is one sign among many that, contrary to received wisdoms of the 20th century, the urbanised villager may turn out to define the future of Asia.","Asiaís other Kejriwals: Thaksin Shinawatra, Joko Widodo's rise to power - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/asias-other-kejriwals-thaksin-shinawatra-joko-widodos-rise-to-power/articleshow/28863155.cms

101,"Aby Rosenís $30 million ìrepositioningî of 757 Third Ave. did the trick. A bunch of new leases have brought the 500,000 square-foot office tower at East 47th Street to 95 percent occupancy less than two years after former main tenant KPMG moved out. In the largest of several recent deals totaling 167,000 square feet, audit, tax and advisory firm Grant Thornton just signed for 130,357 square feet. The 15-year lease moves the firm to RFRís 757 Third Ave. from 666 Third Ave. and expands its Manhattan presence by 20,000 square feet. In addition, Berkley Insurance Co. took 37,453 square feet at 757 Third, which locked in new leases and renewals for nearly 400,000 square feet in the past 24 months. Mitch Konsker, who with Alexander Chudnoff led the Jones Lang LaSalle team representing RFR, said Grant Thornton had seemed likely to renew at 666 Third or move to another location close by. ìThey originally didnít want to go north of 45th Street,î Konsker said. But Konsker credits JLLís Dan Turkewitz for proactively reaching out to Grant Thornton and making sure it took a good look at 757 Third first. The JLL team also included Matt Polhemus and Diana Biasotti. Once they had the firmís attention, ìwe created an unbelievable branding package for them,î Konsker said, including signage over the entrance and their own security desk in the lobby. Popkin worked closely with JLL. ìWhat Iíve found in this market, coming out of a recession, is that large-tenancy deals require a personal touch,î he said. ìThis tenant in particular really wanted to know they would be embraced [by the landlord], since theyíd had other experiences where promises werenít kept. ìWe felt that by attending all the sessions, we were able to put a better face forward ó that this is an RFR building and there really is a difference,î Popkin said. RFRís upgrades to the 1962-vintage tower include modernized, energy-efficient systems and a new lobby. ìWe basically created a brand-new building,î Rosen told us recently. A large corner retail space with 200 feet of frontage is being marketed by NGKFís Jeffrey Roseman. Sen. Chuck Schumer gave a timely nudge to help Larry Silverstein finish building 3 World Trade Center this week. The $2 billion project at 3 WTC was approved in 2009 for $338 million in tax-exempt federal bonds as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ó but the bonds technically expired in 2010. Silverstein couldnít build at the time because the recession had stifled large-scale commercial leasing. Although the matter is complicated, Schumer appealed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to make the IRS agree that the bonds could still be used for 3 WTC. Otherwise, it would have taken time-consuming legislation to free them up for Silverstein. The need for them became urgent when GroupM last month signed a 516,000 square-foot lease to be the 80-story towerís anchor tenant. ìThis is the best news out of downtown in a long time,î Schumer told us Monday. Silverstein also has $1.3 billion in Liberty Bonds for the project, so heíll have a total $1.64 billion in tax-free financing. Heís spent $500 million in insurance proceeds to build the towerís podium. The tower is to open in 2017. As Kingsbridge Armory in The Bronx finally appears close to turning the lights back on after standing vacant for 20 years, itís worth marking a milestone for another huge, one-time military landmark ó the Fort Washington Avenue Armory in Upper Manhattan. Last week, the uptown armory celebrated 100 years as a mecca for track and field events ó most famously as home to Februaryís Millrose Games, which moved there from Madison Square Garden in 2012. The mammoth building was exclusively a homeless shelter in the 1990s. Dr. Norb Sander, a marathon runner and a practicing physician, led the campaign to rescue the classical-revival structure from ruin. Backed by then-mayor David Dinkins, he took it over in 1993 and today is chairman of the Armory Foundation, which operates it as a nonprofit under an agreement with the city. The armory is home to the New Balance Track and Field Center and the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, which draw visitors as well as athletes to the neighborhood. The Kingsbridge Armory might soon be relaunched as an ice-skating arena, but previous attempts to revive it ran afoul of politics. It needed a savior like Sanderís foundation, which has enjoyed close cooperation with the city under several mayors ó but the Bronx has a way of snuffing out dreams prematurely.",757 Third Ave. is roaring back | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/13/757-third-ave-is-roaring-back/
102,"The cityís skyline is becoming a rainbow of dancing colors as more tall towers add programmable LEDs to their tops and antennas. What was once stagnant and mostly white or a primary color is now alive with tint and effect heretofore only seen on the Broadway stage. Soon the nightly dance led by the Empire State Building will include the top of One World Trade Center, where the hues and swirling lights may be coordinated with those enlivening 4 Times Square and One Bryant Park ó all owned in full or in part by the Durst Organization. A spokesman for Durst declined to discuss their plans for turning on the spire lights at 1 WTC, but the company and co-owner, the Port Authority, have been testing them in the middle of some nights. The Durst building LEDs are being programmed by Douglas Durstís son-in-law Mark Domino, and can be controlled from his Android phone. ìIím very pleased with the spires on 4 Times Square and One Bryant Park,î said Durst last year. Once 1 WTCís 1,776-foot-high spire lights are added to the skyline, its nighttime silhouette will appear even taller than during the day, just as the Empire State Buildingís full antenna lights make a dramatic difference, showing off its full height of 1,454 feet. It wasnít so long ago that the Empireís three tiers of lights were changed by ìa bunch of men changing gels,î and if a bulb burned out, there was a black void on the side of the building. When owner Anthony Malkin, Chairman and CEO of the Empire State Realty Trust, traveled to Hong Kong and Shanghai nearly a decade ago, he recalled the ìlights were truly amazingî even though he felt the skyline itself was not distinctive. It took several years for the science to catch up with what Malkin had in mind for the Empire, which has been also going through an approximately $500 million energy-saving modernization program. ìIt was time really to raise our game and get things more exciting,î Malkin recalled. ìWe not only bought the lights, we bought the front end,î which is a lighting board similar to one used at concerts for stage lights. Photo: Angel Chevrestt. Not one to fool around, Malkin called concert promoter Ron Delsener, who in turn recommended Marc Brickman, known for his edgy lighting of the younger Bruce Springsteen. Back in 1981, Brickman told a reporter he was schlepping one of the first personal computers to the Bossí shows, because ìif you can figure out a way to program Bruceís show, you can figure a way to make it work for anything.î That ìanythingî is now the Empire State Building. Brickman was first enlisted to create a simple program for Election Night in conjunction with CNN. The Empireís top changed towards more blue or red depending on the vote tallies for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. ìPeople loved it,î Malkin said. The next stop was New Yearís Eve 2013 when Brickman created a spectacular firework-like LED show set to Alicia Keysí singing ìEmpire State of Mind,î which includes the chorus, ìBright lights will inspire you.î The music was coordinated with the lights and played simultaneously on iHeartRadio while the star made an appearance at the top of the building. (A YouTube video made from someoneís window in Hoboken went viral and has over 800,000 hits.) ìWe do a dazzle effect for New Yearís Eve that is quite amazing,î Malkin said of what is becoming an annual skyline event. Brickman has since programmed both a half-hour Halloween spooktacular with music synchronized on Clear Channelís Z100 (100.3 FM) and KTU (103.5 FM) as well as four shorter light programs to Christmas music. The antenna top was a flickering flame over a blue and white candle during Hanukkah, and it was turned into a swirling red and white candy cane for most of Christmas week. ìI was walking down the street on one of the nights before Christmas,î Malkin recalled. ìThe people in the street were cheering at something, and I turned and looked, and it was at my building. And they werenít even listening to the music.î Nevertheless, Malkin considers having the lights synched to music on the Clear Channel stations as ìcrucial.î Malkin also confided the Empire State Building will have a ìstar roleî during Super Bowl week next month, but declined to share more. ìI love working with Marc; he is so smart and fun,î Malkin added. ìThe shows are getting better and we are getting better and better at doing them.

Dubai-based Etisalat was allowed to invest in Balwa's company and Balwa's connection to Dawood Ibrahim is known to everyone in Mumbai due to his real estate dealings. I am not surprised that Shinde protected and supported him because I find that in many other matters connected with Dawood, the home ministry has been very weak, for instance the Jet-Etihad deal,"" he said. R K Singh had alleged that there were instructions from the home minister not to interrogate Balwa in the IPL-fixing case. ""Even the 2G probe on Balwa took a long time because he was protected by the government. The home minister's link has become evident because of the former home secretary's allegations. The home ministry has taken no steps to catch Dawood, who lives in Pakistan. He celebrates with Bollywood actors in Dubai. Why doesn't India take action then? Why don't they tell the UAE government that we will close down all their commercial enterprises unless they hand him over? He is after all declared an international terrorist. He has an Interpol notice, yet not a single step has been taken to extradite him,"" said the BJP leader. Swamy asked the home minster to come clean about the issue and that he would go to court if need be. ""I am not like Kejriwal who shoots and scoots.

105,"WASHINGTON: After years of recession , financial crisis , fiscal wars and a patchwork recovery, there are relatively few dark clouds on the horizon for the global economy. That is the conclusion of the World Bank's latest global growth forecast, released Tuesday. The bank's economists expect growth overall to increase from 2.4 per cent last year to 3.2 per cent in 2014, and to maintain that level for the next two years. ""The performance of advanced economies is gaining momentum, and this should support stronger growth in developing countries,"" Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank , said in a statement. Indeed, in the latest sign that even battered Europe is on the mend, Eurostat reported on Tuesday that factories in the eurozone ramped up output in November after two months of decline. Industrial production rose 1.8 per cent from October, which itself was revised upward to show a smaller monthly drop. Still, it is not necessarily all clear sailing ahead. The Federal Reserve's slow retrenchment of its economic stimulus campaign - which served to push down interest rates the world over - poses one of the most significant risks for the global economy this year, the bank said. Some lower-income economies may suffer from reduced inflows of investment if interest rates rise, the bank warned, as it has for months. That could lead to defaults and economic turbulence. Even so, the bank's economists do not see the Fed's so-called tapering as pushing global growth off its path. ""Whatever negative effect the taper might have, that's going to be offset by the stronger growth in high-income countries,"" Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said in an interview. ""It's not a doom-and-gloom scenario."" He noted that markets responded calmly when the Fed announced its decision late last year to begin cutting its asset purchases, by an increment of $10 billion, from $85 billion a month. The bank expects that developing economies will grow in 2014 by what would be a relatively moderate pace for them of 5.3 per cent. That would be significantly slower than in the boom years that preceded the global recession. But the bank's economists said they believed that slower growth might. be healthier and more stable, driven by improving economic fundamentals rather than cheap money and financial bubbles. The emerging-market giants China and India should see stronger growth this year, the bank said. But concerns remain: India has struggled with inflation and currency depreciation , and China with a vulnerable banking sector and overinvestment. ""It is important to avoid policy stasis so that the green shoots don't turn into brown stubble,"" said Kaushik Basu, the bank's chief economist. This year, global momentum should benefit from a growing United States, a bottomed-out Europe and a revitalized Japan, the report said. The beleaguered euro area seems to have turned a corner, the report said, and policy and financial uncertainty in the region has significantly eased. Ireland, Portugal and Spain have started growing again, and the pace of contraction seems to have slowed in Greece and Italy. The monthly Eurostat report showed that Ireland, which has just exited its bailout program, led all EU nations, with a sharp 11.7 per cent gain in industrial production in November, bouncing back from a 6.3 decline in the previous month. Germany, the largest European economy, reported a rise of 2.4 per cent, while France managed a gain of 1.4 per cent. The entire European Union, which includes 11 countries beyond the 17 nations that shared the euro last year, reported a 1.5 per cent increase in industrial output in November, putting it 3 per cent ahead of the same month a year earlier. In the United States, federal budget cuts should have a smaller effect on growth in the future, the bank said. And uncertainty stemming from Washington, capped last fall when the federal government shut down over a budget impasse, should pose less of a problem, too. The bank expects growth in the United States of about 2.8 per cent in 2014, up from 1.8 per cent last year. And even Japan has been jolted out of its long slump by aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus in Japan - often called ""Abenomics,"" after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - that is helping bring more balance to the global economy. ""The high-income countries are growing,"" Burns said. ""For the first time in five years, we have two engines at the head of the train of global growth.""","After years of recession, World Bank expecting widespread growth for 2014 - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/after-years-of-recession-world-bank-expecting-widespread-growth-for-2014/articleshow/28826100.cms
106,"MUMBAI: Nikhil Zaveri has been missing for more than a month. In a country where thousands of people fall through the cracks every year, this isn't remarkable in itself. Said to be in his 50s, Zaveri has Huntington's disease ó a hereditary nerve disorder that can lead to progressive deterioration in cognitive functions and other psychiatric issues. Twice-divorced and living with his sister after having had to leave his own house because of debts, relatives said the police have been unable to pick up any trace of the man. But what makes the case significant is that Zaveri owns a piece of land on Mumbai's Nepean Sea Road that could be worth as much as Rs 1,300 crore. The plot is home to the now-defunct Palm Beach School , a once-prestigious institution where south Mumbai's wealthy businessmen vied to get admission for their children. Before his disappearance, Zaveri had plans to revive the school, which closed in 2007, and develop part of the plot as a real estate project. ""Zaveri came to me to seek our help in getting documents in order so that he can build an international high school on that site,"" said Vikram Trivedi , managing partner of Mumbai-based law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal & Co. ""We are working on it. However, he went missing soon afterwards."" Given the potential of the land, Zaveri used to be hounded by developers and brokers with business proposal While some of these did proceed beyond initial discussions, the two sides could never reach an agreement on commercial terms. The family, however, isn't ready to name any particular developer or broker Zaveri may have negotiated with. A picture of Zaveri shows a slight man with gray, wispy hair smiling uncertainly at the camera. From all accounts, he was alone and ailing and finding it difficult to manage, debilitated by illness, while living at the Nepean Sea Road address. It was when he found himself unable to cope with creditors that Zaveri went to live with his sister and her family in Kandivali, a north Mumbai suburb. ""It was very difficult for him and then due to some old dues he had to vacate his home overnight,"" said a family member. ""We are very concerned for his well-being since it's over a month,"" said the family member, who has filed a missing person's complaint at the Samta Nagar police station in Kandivali. The police said they are looking into all possible angles, including trying to trace Zaveri's contacts by phone or otherwise. ""Due to his health, he himself might not be able to locate where he is and further we are concerned because he is the owner of a property, which might be valued high due to its privileged location,"" said one of the police officials, who didn't want to be named. Zaveri had gone missing a few times earlier but was soon discovered at the old school building. ""Nikhil was a chain smoker and used to go to the shop to buy cigarettes,"" said one of his relatives. ""We thought he would return soon but when he didn't turn up the whole night, we started worrying about him. Due to his physical and mental condition, he was not keeping his cell phone with him.""","Nikhil Zaveri, owner of Rs 1,300-cr plot in Mumbai, is missing - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/real-estate/news/nikhil-zaveri-owner-of-rs-1300-cr-plot-in-mumbai-is-missing/articleshow/28809253.cms

109,"MORE ON: AOL is handing majority ownership of Patch, a money-losing network of local news websites, to New York investment firm and turnaround specialist Hale Global in a joint venture announced by the companies on Wednesday. AOL will transfer Patch to a new limited-liability company run by Hale Global. AOL will retain a minority interest. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Hale Global is a 13-year-old firm that specializes in turning around online media, mobile and advertising companies. The partnership is the latest chapter in the history of Patch, a network of more than 900 websites covering events and news in communities such as Montclair, NJ, and Malibu, Calif., that AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong helped start. Investors and analysts have long urged AOL to stop pouring funds ó so far totaling hundreds of millions of dollars ó into Patch with little return. The costly project was one reason that activist hedge fund Starboard Value took a position in AOL and tried to win seats on the board in an ultimately unsuccessful proxy battle. ìAOL has delivered on our commitment to our investors and put Patch in a position to be successful,î Armstrong wrote in a memo to employees. Armstrong had promised that it would become profitable in 2013. To reach that goal, Patch slashed the staff of 1,000 by half late last summer and launched a search for either a partner or a buyer.

At the time it signed a five-year lease to stay in the building. That lease expires Dec. 31. Still, leaving the Big Apple for New Jersey is a shocker as Forbes has been based here for 97 years.

112,"BANGALORE: It took a score of rejection slips for author Amish Tripathi to go direct to his reader. Chancing his luck, the former banker published The Immortals of Meluha on his own - it went on to sell 40,000 copies. Four years on, the best-selling author of the Shiva trilogy is the mascot for India's self-publishing industry, where aspiring writers rely on a network of young companies to ease the process of turning ideas into books. These ventures offer a range of services - from editing and copyright registration to cover design and distribution - making them necessary cogs in the growing wheel of self-publishing. ""Authors such as Tripathi have become superstars through self-publishing and that has increased interest among those who want to publish their work,"" said Naveen Valsakumar, 27, who co-founded NotionPress, which has built an online platform that allows authors to write, format and design a book for free. The Chennai-based company also offers paid packages, where it edits the manuscript, designs the book and even creates promotional posters according to the author's specifications. The two-year-old company charges between 25,000 and 55,000 and has published about 2,500 books so far. ""By end of 2014, we hope to publish books by about 1 lakh authors, of whom at least 30% will use the paid service,"" said Valsakumar, who teamed up with co-founders Bhargava A and Janardhanan Pillay to set up the firm in 2012. NotionPress is one of about half-adozen such ventures, including Cinnamon Teal, Pothi and Zorba Publishers, that cater to those who want to become published authors but are unable to attract the attention of traditional publishers such as Penguin and Random House. ""Self-publishing is freedom of expression,"" said Tripathi, 39, who last year bagged a $1-million (about Rs 6-crore) book deal from Westland Press, which publishes his books that have now sold over 2 million copies. ""Earlier, it was difficult for a middle-class person to get a book published without the backing of a publisher. Now, with companies providing turnkey services it has become a lot easier."" Also, self-published authors get up to 70% of the royalty while in traditional publishing new authors get less than 10%. ""Many authors do not even get a response from publishers,"" said Shalini Gupta, 49, founder of Zorba Publishers. The company started out as a traditional publisher about three years ago, but became a self-publishing platform in 2012, offering services such as editing and design for a fee that ranges from Rs 10,000 to over Rs 35,000. The company aims to earn revenue of Rs 50 lakh next year. Leonard Fernandes, co-founder of Goa-based publishing service provider Cinnamon Teal, said demand has doubled since a year ago. The firm, one of the first to offer such services to authors in India, was set up in 2007. ""Earlier people did not understand the concept. Now there is a certain sure-footedness in self-publishing,"" said Fernandes, who founded the company with his wife Queenie. The company, which charges about Rs 15,000 for end-to-end services, expects to earn Rs 1 crore in the next two years. While multiple rejections are the primary reason for most authors deciding to publish on their own, others do so to have greater control over the process. ""The level of involvement an author can have in the process from the presentation to design cannot be matched in mainstream publishing,"" said Sumana Khan, author of supernatural thriller 'The Revenge of Kaivalya'. The former information technology professional published the book with the help of Cinnamon Teal in 2010. The book was backed by Tripathi's publisher Westland Press in 2013. Like Westland Press, others are looking at self-published works with keen interest. ""We have many self-published books,"" said Kapish Mehra, managing director of Rupa Publications, which brought out the five-part 'Horn OK Please' series by Karthik Iyengar. ""As a business, I feel it (self-publishing) is a very interesting proposition."" There are, however, a number of challenges. Jaya Jha, co-founder of Bangalore-based Pothi, said authors sometimes do not realise that self-publishing companies are not another kind of publisher. ""When going with a self-publishing company the author is the publisher. And the most important responsibility of a publisher is marketing, which in case of self-publishing, falls on the authors' shoulders,"" said Jha, 31, an IIT-Kanpur and IIM-Lucknow alumnus. The firm, which declined to reveal revenue, has published over 4,000 print titles and over 2,500 ebooks. Distribution is another challenge. Neither the authors nor entrepreneurs have the kind of networks that publishers such as Penguin have with distributors to push their books onto the shelves of hundreds of bookstores. However, online sites such as Flipkart and Amazon are levelling the playing field. ""We list the books on these sites and print the book only when an order is placed,"" said Cinnamon Teal's Fernandes. Ebooks are also helping ease the distribution bottleneck. In the past six months, Fernandes said, every second book ordered from Cinnamon Teal was an ebook. ""Once ebooks become more popular, the distribution problem will be solved,"" said Tripathi. ""Then self-publishing can be as successful as mainline publishing in India. ET View: Why Self Publishing is a Good Idea Indeed. Among the unexpected benefits of the spread and ubiquity of the internet and improvements in printing technology, is the emergence of selfpublishing. As several bestsellers show, it is no longer restricted to vanity publishing. Selfpublishing once seemed to threaten the old network of agents, publishers and publicists who dominated the industry. But it forced publishers to adapt to a new model of doing business: today, if self-published books become a success, publishers are saved the job of scouting new talent and adopt the writers immediately.","Self-Publishing: How startups like NotionPress, Cinnamon Teal are changing the way books are created - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/emerging-businesses/startups/self-publishing-how-startups-like-notionpress-cinnamon-teal-are-changing-the-way-books-are-created/articleshow/28808906.cms
113,"NEW DELHI: BJP's prime ministerial candidate and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi could find himself in a tight spot explaining the sharp fall of his home state in the latest Education Development Index by nine places to the 18th rank among 35 states and union territories. The annual index, brought out by the National University Education Planning and Administration, is a composite of 24 indicators of elementary education clubbed into five indices óaccess, infrastructure, teachers and outcomes. Gujarat's impressive economic performance - the gross state domestic product increased from 8% in 2004-05 to 9.8% in 2011-12 ó is not matched by its performance in the elementary education sector. In the latest rankings, for 2012-13, Gujarat's slide is most evident at the primary (classes 1-5) level, where the state ranked 28th compared with 12th in the previous year. At the upper primary (classes 6-8) level, the state fell six spots to 14th from 8th. Gujarat is among the worst performers, at rank 34, on the crucial parameter of access to elementary education. Access takes into account density of schools per 10 square km, availability of schools for every 1000 children, ratio of primary and upper schools. In 2011-12, the state was ranked 33rd. On the parameter of teachers, the state has fallen to the 13th place from 10th in a year. This component comprises percentage of schools with female teachers, pupil teacher ratio as laid out in the Right to Education, percentage of single teacher schools and teachers without professional qualification. Gujarat's downward spiral has been marked in the outcome index as it has plunged from 12th place in 2011-12 to 29th in 2012-13. This index takes into account average number of instructional days, average working hours for teachers, percentage change in enrolment in government schools, gross enrolment ratio, par ticipation of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Muslim children as well as the ratio of boys to girls in enrolment, drop-out and transition rates. Experts point to the fact that Gujarat has done well or shown improvement on some indicators. For instance, the Scheduled Castes comprise 6.7% of the state's popula-tion and their enrolment has held steady between 7.70 (2010-11) and 7.59 (2012-13). Enrolment among Muslims, who comprise 9.06% of the state's population, has been on the rise - 8.41% in 2011-12 to 8.59% in 2012-13. For its part, the Gujarat government has been working towards improving school enrollments though programmes like Shala Praveshotsav and Kanya Kelavani, which are focused on rural areas particularly girls. On a positive note, the state has shown improvement in terms of infrastructure, moving up three places to 12th from 15th according to the latest rankings. This rubric takes into account percentage of schools with the pupilteacher ratio set out by the Right to Education, percentage of schools with toilet facilities for girls and boys, drinking water, ramp for children with special needs and schools with kitchen sheds. improvements in infrastructure will have an impact on the other parameters in the coming years.""",Gujarat drops in annual educational development index - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/gujarat-drops-in-annual-educational-development-index/articleshow/28809650.cms

Researchers found that it is not that younger people are able to remember more than older people but their memories seem better because they retrieve them in higher definition. Philip Ko of Vanderbilt University in the US, led the research team which focused on visual working memory, a personís ability to briefly retain a limited amount of visual information in the absence of visual stimuli. The teamís examination of why this function is reduced during the course of healthy aging took the multiple stages of encoding, maintenance, and the retrieval of memorised information into account. They ran 11 older adults of around 67 years of age and 13 younger adults of approximately 23 years of age through a task called ëvisual change detectioní. This task consisted of viewing two, three or four coloured dots and memorising their appearance. These dots disappeared, and then after a few seconds the participants were presented with a single dot appearing in one of the memorised colours or a new colour. The accuracy of their response (ësameí or ëdifferentí) was considered to reflect how well they memorised the colours. This accuracy of response is referred to as ëbehavioural measureí. Electroencephalographic data was also collected from the participants as they performed the task for a neural measure of their memory capacity. Ko found that while behavioural measures indicated a lower capacity in older adults than younger adults to memorise items, the neural measure of memory capacity was very similar in both groups. In other words, during the maintenance stage, both groups stored the same number of items. The researchers suggest that older adults store the items at a lower resolution than younger adults, resulting in impaired recollection. Unlike older adults, younger adults may be able to use perceptual implicit memory, a different kind of visual memory, to give them a ëboostí when they are trying to retrieve the stored information. ìWe donít know why older adults perform poorly when their neural activity suggests their memory capacity is intact, but we have two leads,î Ko said. ìFirst, further analysis of this current dataset and other studies from our laboratory suggest that older adults retrieve memories differently than younger adults. ìSecond, there is emerging. evidence from other labs suggesting that the quality of older adultsí memories is poorer than younger adults. ìIn other words, while older adults might store the same number of items, their memory of each item is ëfuzzierí than that of younger adults,î Ko said. The study appears in the journal Attention, Perception & Psychophysics, published by Springer.","Younger people have ëhigh definitioní memories, can retrieve them better than the aged | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/younger-people-have-high-definition-memories-can-retrieve-them-better-than-the-aged/

116,"Summary. The path to inebriation in Delhi is often potholed with expense, loud music and a host of other deterrents. And then thereís Harryís. Newly opened in Saketís Select City Walk, Harryís is the first Delhi outpost of the Singapore-based sports bar chain. This one had us from the entrance. As laidback as a lounge chair, the bar is panelled in wood and stone bricks with red couches to sink into and bar stools to perch on. Given that itís a sports bar, three walls have TV screens dedicated to sports channels. The music is pure comfort rock, both soft and hard, with everything from Coldplay to Tom Petty. The poster menus are done in pop colours and comprise typical bar food accented with Singapore street food, a medley of Malay, Chinese, Thai and Indian dishes. So you have burgers jostling for space with Indonesian stay, paratha rolls, Thai curries and sizzlers. The drinks menu is as eye-catching, a host of spirits, shots, a large selection of beers and wines and cocktails priced so reasonably one canít but help look around to check if youíre still in Select City Walk. For instance, their signature cocktails are priced between Rs 179 and 329 while the wines are Rs 279 a glass. The food is as economical with dishes not exceeding Rs 400. We decide to go local and order the signature ó Singapore Sling (gin, cherry brandy, pineapple and lime) and the Dirty Harry (mint vodka with demerara and lychee). Both the drinks are balanced like trapeze artists, boozy but sweet without becoming cloying. To fortify our tissues (and so that we remember our way out) we order the Crispy Potato Chilli (straw potatoes with devil chilli, green onion and dark soy), Harryís Keema Chilli Con Carne Nachos and the Maple Pork Spare Ribs. The nachos come piled high with corn chips, refried beans, chopped tomatoes and jalapenos, salsa, sour cream, cheese sauce and of course the chilli, pretty much a meal in itself. But its the ribs that are truly decadent, layered with enough fat to keep a botox clinic running indefinitely and bursting with maple goodness.We just found our weekend adda.",Chamber of Spirits | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/chamber-of-spirits/
117,"Related. It was the evening before Christmas Eve and not a mouse was stirring. At least in Zerruco by Zilli at The Ashok, New Delhi. What was stirring was some wild mushroom risotto, in a saucepan, in the hands of Aldo Zilli. Despite hosting a brunch to launch his debut venture in the country the previous day, which seemingly catered to a large crowd (and here brunch is a bit of a misnomer, given that the meal stretched on well into the night, exhausting the stewards, chefs and nearly all the ingredients in the kitchen), the man continues to cook. Zerruco by Zilli is his first eatery in the country and 19th around the world, the majority of which are centred around Londonís Soho area, Zilliís first home in the UK. ìMy first intimation to cooking was through my mother. I was the youngest of nine siblings and so helped out with the cooking a lot. Then, at 16, I spent a year at a catering college, before knocking around Europe, learning and cooking in a bunch of places before I ended up in the UK when I was around 20,î he says, in an accent flavoured with both the Adriatic dialect of native Italy and the cockney of adopted London. ìFrance was both the best and the hardest place. The French laid the foundation of modern cuisine, but their chefs are the hardest taskmasters,î he says. In í70s England, Zilli found a thorough lack of authentic Italian cuisine and decided to do something about it. ìThere wasnít any real Italian in the Italian food there. I was one of the first chefs there to bring in Italian ingredients like balsamic vinegar, Parmigiano Reggiano and use stuff like rocket leaves,î he says. Zilliís take on Italian food found him many new friends in London, including a galaxy of stars. Celebrities flocked to Zilliís restaurants, which began to mushroom all over London. He was also the first Italian chef to cook on a British channel. ìI think India is where London was in the í80s, in terms of Italian food. Everyone was going gaga over it. This is my first visit to the country and itís amazing to see how knowledgeable people are about the cuisine and how excited they get about food in general,î he says. Though on his maiden Indian voyage, Zilli is no stranger to Indian food. ìWe eat Indian food both at home and restaurants. In fact, this expansion to India is the result of a conversation I had with a friend of a friend. He said ëIndia is mad about Italian food, you have to come out hereí, and well, here I am,î he says. His friend? Atul Kochhar, the Michelin-starred Indian chef, who runs Benares, the celebrated eatery in Mayfair, London. Zerruco by Zilli, the first of ìthree restaurants in three yearsî, plans to serve rustic Italian fare, including antipasti, wood fired pizza, pasta and desserts, apart from a large wine selection. ìWe flew in a team of Italian chefs to train the staff here, and I will be coming back every three months to supervise the changing of the menu because I like to keep my f.",A to Z(illi) | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/a-to-zilli/
118,"Related. While the matter is easier to settle on a daily basis, the real trouble occurs when we step out of home and are away from our carefully-constructed dietary plans. The problem is compounded in a country like ours, where cuisine is as diverse as culture. Dietary guidelines do vary, of course, depending on health conditions, nature of travel and other criteria. But consult any nutritionist, dietary expert or doctor, and the advice you will get ó adequate hydration and snacking healthy. Swati Kumar Dwivedi, a senior dietician at Max Hospital, Saket, Delhi said, ìKeeping oneself adequately hydrated is of utmost importance, but not with beverages or aerated drinks. Stick to water as much as possible. Coconut water is a good alternative. Even juices are not recommended.î The other benefit of keeping oneself hydrated, according to Dr Ruchi Verma, in-charge of preventive health care programme at Max Hospital, is that it creates a feeling of fullness and helps us avoid junk food. When it comes to snacking, several recent studies have been found to be leaning towards nuts. A New York Times article titled ëSnacking your way to better healthí, dated December 9, quoted several recent studies that found nuts (all kinds) to be one of the healthiest snacks. The article said those who ate nuts regularly tended to be leaner, simply because nuts were replacing other high-calorie snacks such as chips, cookies and candy. Another snack option is dry fruits. Carrying small pouches of dry fruits, possibly mixed with nuts, is highly recommended. If the trip is short, or if you have a portable cooler, experts suggest carrying fresh fruits and vegetables. Homemade sandwiches with whole grain bread and peanut butter are an equally good option. Once your snacks are taken care of, monitoring the rest of the meals is pretty easy. Grilled over fried, baked over grilled, salads over burgers, whole wheat bread over white bread, oats over muffins, boiled eggs over omelette is common knowledge. Fortunately, the hospitality and travel industries too have evolved with peopleís increasing awareness regarding health. As a result, there is always a healthier, low-calorie option available. Arijit Basu, chief general manager (Delhi), State Bank of India, agrees. He travels for work at least six or seven times a month, most of them being two-day trips. ìWherever I travel, meals are usually laid out in a buffet. And there, one always has the option to pick a soup or a salad over the high-calorie options. So if you are eating unhealthy, it is not because you donít have an option,î he says. Most airlines too have begun to offer a variety of menu options catering to specific needs of fliers. Jet Airways, which is one of the few airlines in the country that still has an in-house catering department, offers at least 20 varieties of ëspecialí meals, which cater to the different medical and religious requirements of passengers. The medical ëspecial mealsí include low-fat, low-salt, low-calorie, low-purine, non-lacto and gluten-free meals. ìOur research has shown that first-time passengers and those who travel occasionally want to enjoy every aspect of the flight, especially the food served. Alternatively, the profiles of frequent travellers, such as senior corporate executives and entrepreneurs, are more health conscious, often pre-ordering a healthy or low-calorie option. Our pre-ordered meals also include fresh fruits, whole wheat breads, cereals and yogurt,î the spokesperson said. The thumb-rule is to pick complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates. This is because complex carbs are rich in nutrients, as opposed to the simple carbs which are essentially refined sugars with very little nutritional value. Also the complex carbs take some time to digest, thus ensuring that they donít raise sugar levels in the body as quickly as simple carbs do.",Munch on the go: Dietary guide for jet-setters | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/munch-on-the-go-dietary-guide-for-jet-setters/
119,"Summary. Related. Back in 2010, HTC was one of the top smartphone makers in the world, accounting for one in every ten smartphones sold. After years of strong market performance, the Taiwanese phone maker is in a tight spot, facing stiff competition from Apple, Samsung and other handset makers. Last week, it reported worse-than-expected results for Q4FY13. Though the sale of its remaining 25% stake in Beats Electronics for $265 million helped the company avoid its second-consecutive quarterly loss, it appears that despite aggressive cost-cutting measuresóbuying chips from cheaper vendors, outsourcing production etcóthe handset makerís troubles are far from over. The companyís global share of the smartphone market has declined to 2.2% in the third quarter of 2013, from a peak of 10.3% only two years ago. Competition woes aside, HTC continues to amaze us with their devicesí stunning looks. In a deft strategy designed for high growth markets such as India, HTC has decided to introduce competitively priced models. Recently, it launched two new snappy and smooth phonesóHTC Desire 501 and Desire 601. Both the devices are stylish in looks, have a judicious mix of hardware and software, and offer good web surfing experience. Will they connect with the customer? Let us find out. HTC Desire 501. The original HTC Desire, released in 2010 was a hit among people with its attractive looks, sturdy build, a fairly good camera and plethora of apps. HTC has now debuted its mid-range smartphone, the 4.3-inch HTC Desire 501. It is a dual SIM and an affordable Android with a price tag of Rs 18,290. The phone has a reasonable display with its WVGA, super LCD 2 screen. The screen features decent brightness and colour balance, and offer users fairly reasonable viewing angles. The 501 is powered by a dual-core 1.15 GHz processor, backed by 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage; thereís also a microSD slot for memory expansion. This specification is standard for the price and the minimum that we can expect on an Android handset. On the camera front, we are looking at a familiar 8-megapixel snapper with auto focus. Externally, the 501 is a good-looking phone with bevelled edges and a slightly raised screen, which together give it a chiselled, defined look. Our test unit was a Blue model, but whichever colour you choose, youíll have a phone which is both slimmer and more stylish than pretty much any budget handset out there. In terms of real-world performance, the 501 is fairly good. It is fast, loads web pages quickly and is generally easy to navigate. It is also good at taking photos. Compared to HTC One and One Mini, the Desire 601 sports a much affordable tag of Rs 27,990. Out of the box, it becomes evident that the phone has a stylish design. It comes in three coloursówhite, black and red. The phone has a plastic body with a removable rear battery. Thereís a 4.5 inch qHD display which is much larger than the 501. Underneath, youíll find a 1.4 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor (decent enough to make the Android run smoothly), 8 GB of internal memory which is just adequate for storing reasonable amount of music, video and photos. Like every Desire phone, this one too runs Android. It features the latest version of HTC Sense, incorporating the Blinkfeed home screen. The speakers are similar to those of the HTC One, which give a decent stereo effect. The HTC Desire 601 has a 8-megapixel sensor with an LED flash. It has an interesting piece of software, the Zoe mode software that grabs video at the same time as stills to animate your phone camera gallery. It shoots a burst of stills rather than a single one. In terms of performance, the Desire 601 is a smooth and fast phone with good build quality. In my usage, the phone came across as a fast device with no observable screen lagging. Movies and videos can be played in good quality with its sharp high definition display. If you havenít got much money to buy the latest high-end phone in the market, then the Desire 601 is the one to get.",Review: HTC Desire 501 & Desire 601 | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/review-htc-desire-501-desire-601/

The global leader in audio technologies has announced that televisions running its new Dolby Vision technology will become available in certain markets by the end of this year. So what is Dolby Vision? ìTodayís television images have limitations imposed through legacy. The brightness of the content has been substantially reduced to deliver it on the traditional CRT TVs. The maximum brightness a TV can show you is 100 nits, while the eye is capable viewing of much brighter images,î explains Mathias Bendull, Senior Director, Broadcast Business, Dolby Laboratories . While the latest televisions† Even the new televisions are capable of up to 1000 nits, but Bendull says since the content is also constrained they just upscale what is available. ìWe think this is the wrong way and are working with the industry bodies to change the standard to 10,000 nits. We are also working with everyone one in the value chain to enable this content,î he adds. ìThe brightness gives the director a totally different way to tell the story. For instance, from a colour perspective blues are very weak now an they have the lowest colour allocation. This information is there in the original master, but is dropped in the BluRay or broadcast as TVs are not capable of showing it,î he adds. While the Dolby Vision televisions from Sharp, TCL and Vizio will be available in certain markets by the end of this year, the company has tied up with Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft for content delivery. ìWe get everybody to see the value in the product before launching anything. So soon you will have directors also shooting in this technology,î he says, adding that digital cameras donít need any upgradation for Dolby Vision quality images. The Dolby Vision content will mean 25 per cent more info, so a 8MB stream will need to be 10MB with the new stream. Dolby will encode the normal image and add an enhancement layer for the additional nits. So even TVs without the Dolby Vision capabilities will be able to play the information, though it will not be as good. However, donít expect Dolby Vision to come on regular TVs for some time to come. The technology is being packaged as complementary to Ultra HD or 4K and will be a premium solution for sometime to come. ìWe are not competing with Ultra HD. In fact, a combination of the two That will be the big differentiator for people to buy a new television with Dolby Vision,î Bendull added. Smaller and cheaper screens are on the way, but it will take time. In the future, you could see the same Dolby Vision logos on anything from smartphones to tablets and laptops.","Yes, you heard it right.

121,"Contently, a New York tech outfit that is emerging as a leader in the native advertising world, just landed $9 million in new funding from two venture capital firms ó San Francisco-based Sigma West and Boston-based Sigma Prime Ventures, Media Ink has learned. ìContent marketing has proven to be a powerful approach for companies of all sizes, building their brands and awareness,î said Sigma Primeís Paul Flanagan . Among Contentlyís clients are General Electric, American Express, Pepsi and, on the media side, Forbes and Gawker. Shane Snow, chief creative officer of Contently, said his company ìis a mix between two business models, a software technology company and a talent management company.î Snow, along with CEO Joe Coleman, a boyhood friend from Idaho, and Chief Technology Officer Dave Goldberg, founded the company in 2010. About 80 percent of its revenue is derived from software and the other 20 percent comes from managing an extensive stable of writers ó matching their editorial skills to advertisers looking to get a message across. Snow uses a network of more than 28,000 journalists to develop content. Of that number, he said, ìabout 5,000î are A-listers ó drawn from top media companies which have been downsized or are simply looking to moonlight and earn extra income. Snow matches writers with brands and extracts a 15 percent fee. Generally writers are getting paid at the rate of around $1 a word. The company wonít disclose its 2013 revenues, but Snow said they grew by 400 percent last year and he hopes to see them cross the $20 million barrier in 2014. Snow said that until recently, most of the expenditures for native advertising were coming out of public relations budgets, but more recently he noticed more of the funding coming out of traditional ad agency creative and marketing budgets. ìThere is going to be a lot of market share stolen from banner ads,î he predicts. Native advertising is contracted content written and designed not to look like the advertising it really is. The larger debate that will undoubtedly play out across the media world this year is whether branded advertising threatens or helps traditional media ó magazines, newspapers, TV and radio networks. ìRight now this looks like a way for traditional publishers to make a premium on their page real estate,î said Snow.",Contently lands $9M in venture funding | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/contently-lands-9m-in-venture-funding/

It looks exactly the sameóbrushed metal finish, aluminium unibody with rounded edges and that familiar Apple logo on top. Premium components mean that the lid is easy to open/shut and stays firm, without any wobble. Screen: Some people might find the 1366◊768 pixels resolution of the 11-inch screen to be low, but really, that resolution is fine for this size. Iíve tried 11<U+2033> laptops with 1920◊1080 pixels and rather than clarity, everything gets miniaturized. The one thing that is an issue, though, is that the screen is not matte. For a notebook that stresses on its portability, it would have been nice to be able to use it anywhere without screen glare. Itís not as bad as the Macbook Pro, but it could have been better. Performance: The new Mac Air is powered by Intelís Haswell processor and HD5000 graphics. And the performance shows. You can edit videos and images just as easily and smoothly as you can play games like Bioshock Infinite. Memory: The notebook ships with a 128GB SSD, so you wonít have much trouble with storage. But if you need more, unfortunately, the 11-inch model does not a memory card slot. It would have been a nice addition. Software: The new model ships with the latest Mac OS X Mavericks, and the good news is that Apple is now giving its iWork suite free with that. Just head to the Mac App Store and download itóthatís a great bonus! Keyboard: The Macbook Air has one of the best keyboards on any laptop in the worldóin fact, the best one, in my opinion. As someone who writes for a living, I havenít used anything which compares to the Macbook keyboard for the past few years, and the new model keeps that up, complete with the ability to work at night with backlighting. Battery: Man, if you were impressed with the battery life of previous generations of Airs, youíll love this one. The new Macbook Air has the best battery Iíve seen on any notebook. It lasts for over 10 hours of normal usage; over 5 hours of continuous video playback of a 1080p video; and over 7 hours of continuous internet browsing. Wow. Verdict: If you are looking for a laptop that combines performance, battery and portability, the Macbook Air is the best purchase right now. As we noted, even at its price of Rs. 61,990, it is a cheaper deal than any comparative Windows laptop, even if you were to go on hardware alone.

126,"Related. CES is an open house these days. While most of the media attention is on announcements from major brands in the industry such as Samsung Electronics, LG, and Sony, of late smaller companies and new startup have been shaking things up. CES 2014 was the show it promised to be with hundreds of new devices and technologies on show. We pick 10 of the best, maybe not the ones that have got a lot of attention. 10. 3Doodler. The Kickstarter darling made its big public appearance at CES 2014 and the result was quite exciting. This 3D printing pen takes all of the modeling out of 3D printing and opens up creating objects to pretty much everyoneóincluding kids. While you might not be able to do quite as much as you could with an actual 3D printer, it is a lot of fun to play with for only $99 (Rs 6,090). 9. Mophie Space Pack There are always an insane amount of smartphone accessory companies at CES, but few of them manage to capture the attention of audiences. Then there was a Mophie Space pack. This iPhone 5/5s case not only charges your phone with additional battery, it also adds 32GB of storage to your device. The Mophie lets you drop your videos, pictures, and documents straight into its storage and even lets you play videos right from it. Not only that, the Space Pack is designed beautifully and surprisingly doesnít add a lot of heft to the phone. 8. Steam Machines The desire to break into the home console market has been growing among both consumers and companies for years now, whether itís from independent Android consoles like the Ouya or big rumored living room takeovers from the likes of Valve or Apple. At CES, Valve CEO Gabe Newell finally lifted the lid off of the first generation of Steam Machines. The amount of computers on display was a bit shockingóas was the announcement that the consoles would range from anywhere between $500 (Rs 30,760) and $6000 (3,69,120). While many of these models still feel like prototypes in many ways, there is no longer any question regarding whether or not Valve is actually serious about the living room market. They areóand Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have reason to be paying attention. 7. LGís Curved TV The whole curved screen has quickly become the great gimmick of 2014óthat is, until LG showed off its 105î OLED 4k TV that just happened to have a nice flexible display on it. The curvature to this massive, gorgeous television feels just rightóand unlike the curved displays on their smartphones, actually enhances the experience. This might be another product that wonít be hitting dealer shelves anytime soon, but that doesnít take anything from the fact that LG has made an immersive and interesting television. 6. Pebble Steel Smartwatch The Pebble Smartwatch was on the top of our best mobile gadgets of 2013, and for good reason. It was the firstóand perhaps the onlyósmartwatch that made sense for the average person that doesnít want strangers staring at their wrist while walking down the street. The Steel isnít just a 2014 update to the original modelóit is Pebbleís next step toward reaching the mainstream market. Both the leather and aluminum straps look and feel fantasticóand while theyíre no Rolex, the update might be enough for those who donít currently wear a watch every day. 5. Playstation Now Playstation Now isnít exactly a gadgetóbut for gamers, this online game streaming service was the most important announcement at CES this year. Sony had purchased the cloud gaming service Gaikai in 2012, but it wasnít until this year at CES that we knew what for. Not only does Playstation Now effortlessly solve the backwards compatibility problem, but now Sony just may have the Playstation 4ís killer appóthe thing that will make gamers want to reserve space for it under their TV. 4. Alcatel OneTouch Idol X+ Alcatelís entry into the high-end smartphone market is good news cause it will ultimately make these devices more affordable. The prices of the best smartphones were skyrocketing with each consecutive generation costing more than its predecessor. Sure enough, inflation has something to do with it, but not everything. Major handset makers are using the power of their brands to feed their greed. With the likes of Alcatel emerging, the West might see a cut in prices. We in India are lucky to have Micromax and other local phone makers. 3. Asus Transformer Book Duet Multi-platform devices are coming. The Asus Transformer Book Duet is not the first such device by any stretch of imagination, but it is getting us closer to that [multi-platform] dream. This laptop is made for heavy usage, boasting top-notch specs while allowing folks to use it both for business and leisure. Itís likely many other OEMs will follow-up with similar devices that merge Windows 8 and Android into a single device. 2. Samsung Galaxy Note Pro The massive 12.2î tablet is Samsungís answer to both the iPad Air and the Surface 2. Samsung has taken Android and placed what they call the Magazine UX on top of it. While we are not so certain the new homescreen interface is necessarily the best for ëprofessionalsí, it takes the best parts of Windows 8ís live tiles and is a big improvement over most of Samsungís typical TouchWiz Android skins. The Note Pro also includes the Note 3ís excellent stylus to make for a big tablet that is fun to interact with and write on. 1. Sony Xperia Z1 Compact Smartphones arenít really much of a thing at CES anymore because most of the big manufacturers now save the unveiling of their flagship devices for their individual conferences and press events. However, Sony quietly brought what might be their best smartphone in years to the show: the Xperia Z1 Compact.

127,"Summary. Related. Traditionally, buying a Macbook has always meant that you shell out more than what you would for a Windows laptop with equivalent hardware. But with the 2013 Macbook Air models, things have changed. Thereís no longer a ìMac Premiumî or an ìApple Taxî as going with a Windows machine would mean spending the same amount. In fact, the Macbook is cheaper! I was in the market for a new laptop. Iím not a Mac guy ó I still use a PC dual ó booting between Linux and Windows and wanted a notebook PC that gives me the same setup. But there were a few requirements: Fantastic battery life: Even ìvery goodî would not do, I needed a minimum of a full work day without charging, which is 8-9 hours for me. Lightweight & portable: I needed to be able to take this notebook with me anywhere I go without thinking twice about the weight I have to carry around. This also meant a smaller screen, preferably 11 inches, but 13 inches would do as well. Powerful: I test software, I edit images, I usually have at least 15 tabs open in Chromeóthis could not be a machine that would buckle under that pressure. Itís good if it ran on Intelís new Haswell processors because of the graphics chipset boost, but obviously, a dedicated graphics card was better. And yeah, an SSD was a must. So I started searching for something which would do what I wanted. I have always eschewed buying a Macbook because it was usually more expensive than a Windows laptop with equivalent hardware. But surfing through all the options in India, I got a surprising result: the new Macbook Air is actually cheaper than any 11-inch or 13-inch high-end Windows ultrabook. The closest competitor is the Sony Vaio Pro, which has the same inner hardware, but boasts an 11-inch touchscreen with a FullHD 1920◊1080 pixels resolution. In our review, it clocks a little over 6 hours of battery life. The Macbook Air costs Rs. 61,990 in stores, and you can get a further Rs 5,000 discount or buy an Apple product of that price (depending on where you purchase the device). The 11<U+2033> Sony Vaio Pro costs Rs 69,990 and discounts are in the range of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000.

128,"Not at a janta†durbar. The scenes at the janta durbar of people who had reached the Delhi secretariat to get their complaints heard bore testimony to the fact that a centralised mechanism cannot be expected to succeed in resolving peoplesí complaints. C R SASIKUMAR. Summary. A grievance redress system must provide a decentralised system for receiving and dealing with complaints. The wake-up call from the AAP that halted the BJP in its tracks in Delhi appears to have finally awakened the Sangh Parivar. Anjali Bhardwaj†and†Amrita Johri. A grievance redress system must provide a decentralised system for receiving and dealing with complaints. A malaise that afflicts every citizen of the country is the lack of an effective mechanism in the government to deal with everyday grievances of people ó non-receipt of pensions, poor delivery of ration, broken roads, poor sanitation and drainage. It is therefore not surprising that the recent janta durbar initiative launched by the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi crumbled under the overwhelming number of complainants who turned up. A centralised grievance redress mechanism, wherein complainants need to get an audience with ministers to have their complaints heard, will inevitably be fraught with problems. Even for complaints that ministers are able to hear personally, the standard response would be to forward them to the concerned departments. The departments would accord them priority as they are accompanied by a communication from the minister, but there will be no system for follow-up or for filing an appeal unless an appropriate and comprehensive grievance redress (GR) mechanism is put in place. There are existing supervisory structures and GR systems in every government department. In addition, in Delhi, several vigilance committees, such as the district grievance redress committee, thana committee, ration vigilance committee and Rogi Kalyan Samiti, have also been set up to address peopleís complaints. The ineffectiveness of these mechanisms might make it tempting to demand the dissolution of existing systems and setting up new, parallel structures. But unless the problems that plague these systems are understood and fixed properly, the new mechanism would soon be affected by the same glitches. Supervisors in our bureaucracy are to ensure delivery but have escaped real accountability. An effective GR mechanism should hold both the implementing functionary and the supervisory structure accountable. It should provide every person the right to make a complaint and create an architecture for complainants to receive time-bound redress. Failure to do so should attract a penalty to be paid from the concerned officerís pocket. There are some critical provisions that must be included in a GR mechanism to ensure it has the institutional capacity to effectively receive, inquire into and redress complaints.†In a country like India, it is critical that a GR mechanism provide a decentralised system for receiving and dealing with complaints close to peopleís place of residence. A janta durbar goes against the basic grain of decentralisation by requiring people to converge at one central place to register all manner of complaints. It places an immense burden on the already aggrieved complainants of having to travel long distances to register their complaints. The scenes at the janta durbar of thousands of people who had reached the Delhi secretariat to get their complaints heard bore testimony to the fact that a centralised mechanism cannot be expected to succeed in resolving peoplesí complaints. In order to facilitate registration, follow-up and tracking of grievances, the GR mechanism must provide for facilitation centres at the most decentralised level. Citizens should have the right to file a complaint in multiple ways ó on paper, through email, text message, website and telephonically. Every government office should have a supervisor designated as a grievance redress officer (GRO) at the municipal ward level for receiving and disposing of complaints within a stipulated timeframe. The GRO should have adequate authority and power to ensure that the deficiency is redressed in the stipulated timeframe and responsibility fixed. The supervisory structure, the fulcrum for the redress of grievances, must be held accountable by holding supervisors (GROs and heads of departments) answerable for not sorting out peopleís complaints. It is essential that a GR mechanism provide for an independent authority at the district level to take action against GROs who do not resolve complaints properly. Further, appeals against the decision of the district level authority must lie with a state-level grievance redress commission. Delhi already has a Delhi Public Grievance Commission (PGC), which should be given powers to penalise erring officials and, where necessary, provide compensation to complainants. Also, grievances are often symptomatic of larger problems and therefore must be inquired into properly, to not just redress individual complaints but also fix systemic problems. The PGC should therefore have powers to give directions, where appropriate, about systemic changes that may have to be made to prevent the recurrence of grievances. The GR mechanism must provide for the imposition of mandatory penalties on GROs and other erring officials, unless the officers can show that they made all possible efforts to redress the grievance. These penalties must be deducted from the salaries of the concerned officials. There must be provisions for compensating complainants for the loss and detriment suffered as a result of non-redress of grievances. An effective GR mechanism has the potential to transform the relationship between an ordinary citizen and the bureaucracy. One hopes that the current dispensation in Delhi will put in place a proper system for redressing peopleís complaints and not allow it to be reduced to an arbitrary, populist measure. The latest reported proposal of the AAP government to include grievance redress in the ìDelhi Jan Lokpalî, which is meant to look into cases of corruption, will also run into problems. While it is true that some complaints of non-delivery of essential services arise out of corruption, an even larger number of complaints arise due to problems like inefficiencies in government, lack of resources ó human or material ó or due to the policies of the administration. To term all complaints as cases of corruption would be a falsehood. Further, a high-powered institution like a lokpal or lokayukta, set up to investigate and prosecute complex cases of corruption, would be rendered ineffective if it were also mandated to look into everyday grievances of people, given the volume of such complaints.",Not at a janta durbar | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/not-at-a-janta-durbar/
129,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. Arvind Virmani. Vote share of a ruling party varies with its economic performance. In 2004, the BJP lost the general election, despite its belief that the Indian economyís performance had been outstanding and voters would reward it for this performance. Many analysts and most opposition parties accepted the contention that the economy was performing very well, but the fruits of this growth had not reached the ìaam aadmiî who voted against the BJP. As a contrarian, I argued that the economic performance had been, in fact, worse than during the previous regime and voters had punished the government for poor economic outcomes. Earlier this month, the prime minister gave a press conference to assert that the economic performance of his government had been outstanding and the Congress party was therefore likely to win the elections again. Unfortunately, he is making a mistake very similar to the one made by the BJP. The actual performance, which matters to the aam aadmi voter, is much worse than the performance benchmark (as per the model developed by me). The outcome is therefore likely to be equally disappointing for the Congress party. Under normal circumstances, elections are held every five years. At the end of the five years, the simplest way for the aam aadmi to judge a governmentís performance is to see how he and his family, his friends, neighbours and acquaintances have done during those five years and compare this with what happened during the previous five years (with an earlier government). If the performance is better/ worse than in the benchmark years there would be an increased/ reduced likelihood of him voting for the party in power. Pared down to the barest essentials, there are three economic indicators that, in our view, matter to the independent, swing or marginal voter. These are economic growth, public goods and services (popularly referred to as ìbijli, paani, sadakî) and transfers or subsidies net of taxes. The growth of per capita income determines not only the change in the living standards of the average voter but also the employment opportunities (in jobs or self-employment) created and available to her. Public goods include a range of local or municipal services such as roads, drinking water, sewage, sanitation, drainage, public health and basic education. An improvement (or worsening) in the quality and/ or volume of such services would tend to have a positive (or negative) impact on the voter and thus tend to increase (or reduce) the ruling partyís vote share. A change in net transfers or subsidy-taxes would similarly be associated with a change in vote share. The quality of governance and the degree of corruption are as, if not more, important than the paper or budgetary expenditures (actual delivery/ outcomes matter) and notional tax collection (harassment and under-the-table costs matter).†Here, we focus on the growth of per capita GDP as an indicator of the improvement or worsening of the lot of the average marginal voter. Thus, if the rate of growth of per capita income has increased or decreased, the vote share of the ruling party is likely to show a corresponding increase or decline. Given this hypothesis, let us look briefly at the past two elections. The NDA government had been in power from 1999-2000 to 2004-5 when the general elections were held. During its tenure, the average per capita GDP at factor cost grew at 4.1 per cent per annum, compared to an average of 4.5 per cent per annum in the previous five years. Thus, average per capita growth was 0.4 percentage points (9 per cent) lower than during the previous five years, making a reduction in the BJP-NDAís vote share highly likely. It appears that the ìIndia Shiningî campaign may have jarred with the reality seen by the more aware or better informed urban voters, and thus exaggerated the relatively small decline in per capita growth. The Congress party consequently came into power in 2004-5 and ran the government as part of the UPA till 2008-9. During this period, the growth of per capita GDP accelerated by an incredible 2.7 percentage points (69 per cent) to 6.8 per cent per annum. As predicted by our model, this 69 per cent acceleration in the rate of growth of per capita income led to a dramatic increase in the vote share of the Congress party, leading to a sweeping victory in the 2009 general election. The scale of the victory surprised both partisan politicians and objective analysts, but it is completely consistent with our model. What does the model say about the forthcoming general election? During the tenure of the current government, UPA 2, which spans from 2009-10 to 2013-14, per capita GDP growth is likely to average about 5.4 per cent per annum. This is a decline of 1.4 percentage points or 21 per cent from the growth rate during the previous five years. Thus, ipso facto, the fall in the Congress vote share in the 2014 general election is likely to be greater than that of the BJP in the 2004 election but less than the gains of the Congress in the same election. The issues of corruption and governance will also affect voter behaviour as they are directly related to the quality and volume of public goods and services supplied by the government as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of welfare transfers. Both of these will have a further adverse effect on Congress partyís vote share.

""Producing power beyond $8.4 per mmbtu is possible but it will never get sold. So you are producing a product the market wont buy,"" Scindia said. Cabinet Committee on Investment last year approved the doubling of natural gas prices to $8.4 from April 1, 2014. The move is expected to result in higher power tariff, urea cost and CNG prices. Scindia said: ""My rationale is very simple power and fertiliser are are both regulated industries in terms of their output and therefore it is extremely important to look at logical pricing with regard to input."" He added that some sort of mechanism has to be put in place for both power and fertiliser sectors to ensure that it is viable. ""I am not saying subsidy or special dispensation, but something."" Describing gas-based power generation as one of the many vexatious issues that he has had to deal with, the minister wished he could have done more on the subject. ""Scarcity of gas is an issue and imported RLNG (Regassified Liquid Natural Gas) is an expensive proposition, so you are caught between rock and a hard place. Its almost a very critical problem to solve and I have tried to do what I could do. I wish I could have done some more.""

133,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. Shibani Ghosh. Environmental regulator envisaged by SC has structural flaws that must be fixed. The recent order of the Supreme Court, directing the Union of India to establish an environmental regulator by March 31, 2014, may appear to some to be a case of judicial overreach ó the court telling the executive how to do its job. To others, it is the latest in a series of Supreme Court judgments in the environmental sphere where the prolonged inaction of the government has forced the court into crisis management mode. Most would agree, however, that the courtís order underscores the urgent need for systemic reform in environmental governance in India, particularly in the context of the environmental clearance process. The Supreme Courtís order was issued to enforce a 2011 judgment of the court, in a case concerning limestone mining in Meghalaya by Lafarge Umiam. There, it was alleged that mining was being undertaken in forest land without regulatory approvals, and that false information had been submitted by the project proponent. In a judgment delivered by then Chief Justice Kapadia, the court permitted mining but highlighted several deficiencies in the environmental and forest clearance processes. To improve these processes, it laid down certain guidelines for the Centre to follow. It also determined that it was ìincumbentî on the Central government to exercise its powers under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, in order to constitute a national regulator for ìappraising projects, enforcing environmental conditions for approvals and to impose penalties on pollutersî. The shortcomings identified by the court in the Lafarge judgment and reiterated now have been repeatedly highlighted by activists and civil society groups over the years ó the lack of accurate data on the status of the environment and baseline figures, excessive reliance by decision makers on the data provided by project proponents, the absence of credible and independent impact assessment, and poor appraisal of the environmental impact of proposed projects. And these are merely illustrative of a larger set of problematic issues in the environmental clearance process. Numerous recommendations have been made in the past regarding possible avenues for institutional reform to address these problems. In 2001, a high powered committee constituted by the Supreme Court had recommended the setting up of a National Environment Protection Agency as a technical arm of the ministry of environment and forests and the Supreme Court in 2003 directed the Central government to take this recommendation ìwith all seriousnessî. The Planning Commissionís steering committee on the environment and forests in 2007 recommended the setting up of national and state environmental clearance authorities as statutory bodies independent of the government. The UPA government itself has initiated efforts aimed at institutional restructuring. Therefore, the position taken by the Centre before the court (contesting the need for a national regulator) is somewhat surprising. In 2009, the National Conference of Ministers of Environment and Forests supported the creation of ìan autonomous, professional and science-based bodyî. This was followed by three proposals in 2009-2010 by the MoEF ó led at the time by Jairam Ramesh ó proposing alternative institutional models, but all with the stated objective of improving the environmental clearance process. The most recent of these proposals called for the setting up of a National Environment Assessment and Monitoring Authority (NEAMA) that would primarily perform the functions of appraisal and monitoring in the environmental clearance process ó very similar to what has been directed by the Supreme Court. The NEAMA model was publicly endorsed by the prime minister in 2011. While the government has undoubtedly dragged its feet on introducing far-reaching reform and the court has served yet another wake-up call, the possible ramifications of the courtís order, even setting aside concerns about the separation of powers, are troubling. With the general elections around the corner, the Centre is unlikely to expend much time or effort in implementing the courtís order in any real manner. The regulator envisaged by the court is similar to the NEAMA and, given the short deadline, the Centre may be inclined to adopt that model. This is problematic because the NEAMA model was critiqued when it was first proposed as being inadequate, and for eschewing significant changes to the regulatory process. In that model, state-level institutions were left untouched. Concerns regarding the new institutionís autonomy, accountability, interaction with existing institutions and staffing requirements were raised. It was hoped then that the ministry would take note of the critical feedback and go back to the drawing board. The regulatory structure envisaged by the court has the Centre retaining the final word, an issue that in itself merits further debate. But that apart, appraisal and monitoring functions must be given a more meaningful role in decision-making through careful design and empowerment of the new institution. If the Centre hastens into constituting a new body, whether along the lines of NEAMA or not, to mechanically and half-heartedly follow the courtís order, it risks worsening an already feeble governance mechanism. Issuing a notification to set up a new institution without adequate staff, resources and infrastructure would be a token gesture, violating both letter and spirit of the courtís order.

134,"Would your life insurance policy really take care of the financial needs of your dependents as insurers promise to do after your death? Don't take them for granted. Insurance regulator IRDA's annual reports for 2012-13 reveal that of the total 23 private life insurers, only five have a claim-settlement ratio of over 90% (in terms of number of policies), despite many of them having completed 10 years of operations. The figure tells you that many insurers are tight-fisted when it comes to passing on the benefits to nominees. According to financial advisors , it's time insurance buyers, especially those considering pure protection-term covers, take their eyes off the claims of lowest premium and highest benefits, and pay a more attention to the claim settlement record of the insurance company. ""Claims settlement ratio, along with related data, is the only objective yardstick for the consumer to determine which insurance company is preferable and more reliable,"" says consumer activist Jehangir Gai . IRDA's data reveals LIC had the best claim settlement ratio of 97.73% among life insurers in the country. Private life insurers' average settlement record was at 88.65%. Of the 23 private life insurers, only five ó ICICI Prudential Life, SBI Life, HDFC Life , Max Life and Kotak Life ó have a claim settlement record of over 90%. Shriram Life, Aegon Religare, Edelweiss Tokio and DLF Pramerica Life are at the bottom of the list. Insurers say wrong information provided by policyholders in the proposal form or non-disclosure of facts are the key reasons for rejection of claims. Often, they claim, this is because many policyholders leave the paperwork to agents. So, apart from completing the form yourself when you have zeroed in on an insurance product, next time ask your insurance advisor for the claim settlement record of the insurer. Even before asking him for details, you can visit the website of the insurance regulator and go through the industry data to ensure the advisor doesn't take you for a ride. ""Customers should exercise caution while buying a policy. They should select a company which has a claims settlement ratio of above 95%,"" says Kalpana Sampat , chief of branch operations (underwriting and claims), ICICI Prudential Life. However, please note the distinction: new companies typically tend to have a high claim-rejection ratio. As older companies see more of non-early claims, their overall rejection ratio seems lower. Insurers are not allowed to reject claims citing non-disclosure of facts, if the policy has been in force for more than two years. For a newer company, which is bound to have more early claims, the overall repudia-tion ratio seems higher as most claims are likely to be early claims, requiring investigation. However, do not stop at just examining the claim-settlement record. Claimpending ratio would help you in ascertaining the time taken by insurer to settle claims. According to the IRDA annual report, private insurers' claim-pending ratio stood at 7.68% (pending for 3-6 months). LIC's ratio was higher at 15.47%. A high claimpending ratio usually points to the company's inefficiency in processing claims, particularly, if the proportion of claims pending for more than six months is higher. ""While considering claims-pending ratio, ageing of claims pending should be considered. There are three bands ó within three months, three to six months and greater than six months. As per policyholder protection guidelines, all claims should be decided within six months. There should not be too many claims pending for more than three months,"" says P Ravi Kutumbarao, head-technical, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance. Turnaround time for claim settlement is crucial as wel. You will get an indication of the time taken by a company to settle claims. While choosing an insurer, check whether a huge proportion of claims has been settled after a delay of more than 180 days.","Donít be lured by low premium, check coís settlement record too - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/personal-finance/insurance/insurance-news/dont-be-lured-by-low-premium-check-cos-settlement-record-too/articleshow/28867527.cms
135,"Six mutual fund houses ó Axis , HDFC , ICICI Prudential , SBI , Kotak and Union KBC ó have launched closed-ended debt-oriented hybrid funds investing in a mix of fixed income instruments and stocks in January. These closed-ended hybrid funds invest approximately 80% of the money in high quality bonds, which over a three-year period, ensure return of capital. The remaining 20% of the money is invested in stocks, which offer extra kicker to the returns. Some products come with a five-year term, too. Most market participants look at these products as means to generate a bit higher post-tax returns than fixed deposits. ""Closed-ended hybrid funds are good investment option for investors who need conservative exposure to equities and do not need liquidity,"" says Jignesh Harshadrai Shah, investment advisor of Capital Advisors. Though units of such schemes are listed on the stock exchange, they are rarely traded on the bourse. Investors typically get to exit at a steep discount to the prevailing net asset value of the scheme. In short, investors should be prepared to hold on to investments till the maturity of the scheme. Industry participants attribute the surge of such new fund offers to change in investors' preference and the current market scenario. ""Retail investors are demanding safer mutual fund products,"" says G Pradeepkumar, chief executive officer of Union KBC Asset Management Company. Investors are more comfortable with these hybrid funds because they offer protection against any huge downside at the end of the tenure of the scheme and a little exposure to equity would provide extra returns, he adds. ""Higher interest rates hovering in the range of 8-9% on three-year paper give scope for relatively higher exposure to equity of 20% in the current scenario in such funds,"" says Surajit Mishra,national head ó mutual funds, Bajaj Capital . ""Such products in the past have generated post-tax returns of 6.1-12% in the past,"" he adds. However, the ""returns"" depend on the extent of exposure to equity and how equities perform during the period. ""Three years ago, the interest rates were lower than what they are today. That is why hybrid funds launched in those days are delivering low returns,"" says Mishra of Bajaj Capital. Low interest rate means that the fund manager has to put more money in fixed income instruments to ensure return of capital, leaving less allocation to equity. Also, the equity markets have not done well in the past three years. For example, CNX Nifty , the market bellwether index, delivered 2.31% in the three-year ended January 10. In fact, mutual funds are targeting investors who are keen to invest in equities but are afraid of losing money in the stock markets. However, everybody is not in favour of investing in hybrid funds. ""Many hybrid funds have not lived up to the returns expectations of the investors. Investors are better off building such a structure for themselves,"" says Abhinav Angirish, managing director of investonline. in ó an online mutual fund distribution entity. He asks investors to invest in a good debt fund and diversified equity fund with a good long-term performance record in the ratio of 80:20 with a three-year time frame. Many experts also believe that closed-ended hybrid funds are not tax-efficient. Capital gains of these schemes are taxed as a debt fund ó lower of 20.6% with indexation and 10.3% without indexation. If an investor invests in a combination of debt and equity schemes, only the debt fund is taxed and equity fund returns are tax free after one year.",Risk averse investors can check out debt-oriented hybrid funds - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mutual-funds/mf-news/risk-averse-investors-can-check-out-debt-oriented-hybrid-funds/articleshow/28811206.cms
136,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. On FDI in retail, its government shows a lack of understanding of what benefits aam aadmi the most. The AAP government in Delhi has decided to block the entry of foreign multibrand retailing, on the grounds that this would induce job loss. The argument underlying this decision is flawed. First, modern multibrand retailing actually generates more jobs for the working class than conventional Indian mom-and-pop retailing, under which family members of the owner work in the shop. With modern retailing, on the other hand, the shareholders could be located anywhere, and the stores would hire workers in Delhi. Then, typically, modern stores work two or three shifts a day, and thus generate much more employment per store when compared with family-run shops. Further, employment in modern retailing is generally more meritocratic in nature: the persons employed in the store do not have to be relatives of its owners. Second, the AAPís decision does not kill modern retailing in Delhi, it only restricts it to Indian companies. It is not clear why the shareholders of Indian retail firms should be favoured over those of global retailing firms, particularly when the latter possess a superior technology that is good for consumers and workers. The AAP may also have failed to gauge the real impact of modern multibrand retailing on voters. A more sophisticated understanding of politics would focus on voters at large and not obsess about the interests of either owners or workers. The real impact of organised retailing is on consumers. And here, the international evidence shows, for instance, that the poor are the biggest gainers from Walmart. Walmartís remarkable global optimisation of production, inventory and transportation yields low prices for mass produced products that matter the most to the poor. Indeed, the elites in the US look down upon shopping at Walmart. If the AAP government truly aims to cater to the interests of the aam aadmi of Delhi, it would lay out the red carpet for Walmart and its ilk. The AAPís decision on multibrand retailing may be seen as yet another illustration of the gap between the politics of protest that has brought the party into prominence and the complex business of running a government which calls for the capacity to balance the specific interests with the general, the short term concerns with those that are likely to endure in the longer run. The decision may also have an unfortunate cascading effect. Gujarat chief minister and the BJPís prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, has already said that he opposes FDI in multibrand retail. It would be unfortunate if other parties also take their cue from these populist stances.",AAPís misjudgement | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aaps-misjudgement/
137,"NEW DELHI: After years in the shadows as a reluctant heir-apparent, Rahul Gandhi is set for his own tryst with destiny, to lead the Congress party in elections due by May that it has only a slim chance of winning. Congress, in power for the last decade, is struggling in opinion polls with a string of corruption scandals and a reputation for poor governance engulfing its administration. BJP, a resurgent opposition & AAP, an anti-corruption party appear to have a stranglehold on public opinion. Congress's response is likely to be to bring the 43-year-old heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to the forefront, in the hope that the charisma of the family can still bring in votes. Congress will hold a meeting on Friday where delegates are likely to formally choose Gandhi to lead the party in the election, although Sonia Gandhi, is expected to remain the Congress chief. Gandhi has much to prove but aides say he has thrust himself into the centre of the campaign, launching a series of moves to clean up the 128-year-old Congress party and stem the slide in its fortunes. They say he has asked for the right to name at least 100 of the party candidates to the 543-member parliament and that he will ditch many of the old guard powerbrokers who have given Congress a bad reputation. ""There are certain changes Mr Gandhi has been wanting to do, they may come through. Changes whether dramatic or subtle, I don't know what you would call them, (but) they will be substantial,"" Sachin Pilot, corporate affairs minister and one of the stars in Gandhi's political team, told Reuters. Critics say Gandhi has depended on his family name for power, that he is too lightweight and has barely registered his presence in parliament although he has been a member for the last decade. ""In a structured party, Mr Rahul Gandhi would still have been struggling to get his first assignment as an office-bearer in the party structure or in a legislative body,"" said Arun Jaitley , a senior leader of BJP. ""It is only in a personality and family-dominated set-up like the Congress that he can be nominated as the unquestioned supremo."" The tryst. For decades after Jawaharlal Nehru , Rahul's great-grandfather, delivered his stirring ""tryst with destiny"" speech on the eve of independence from Britain 67 years ago, the Gandhi family has dominated politics in the world's biggest democracy. Rahul Gandhi, is a vice-president of Congress and was in charge of the party's campaign in state elections in 2013, in which it fared disastrously. BJP won three of five state assembly contests and its flag-bearer, Narendra Modi , remains the front-runner by a distance, campaigning on a platform of decisive leadership to revive economic growth that under the Congress fell to its slowest pace in a decade. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh conceded that the government had failed to generate employment in manufacturing, to control inflation and combat corruption. He said he would not be a candidate to retain his post after the election and strongly suggested that the reins be handed over to Gandhi. ""Rahul Gandhi has outstanding credentials to be nominated as the ... candidate and I hope our party will take that decision at an appropriate time,"" Singh said.",Rahul Gandhi faces his own tryst with destiny - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rahul-gandhi-faces-his-own-tryst-with-destiny/articleshow/28881303.cms

The decision was taken by the Congress Working Committee on the eve of the AICC session on Friday. Senior Congress general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi said all members of the CWC wanted Rahul be declared as the PM candidate. ìBut as the discussion progressed, Congress president Sonia Gandhi intervened and said the Congress does not have such a tradition. If anybody has declared their PM candidate, that does not make it necessary for us to follow suit,î Dwivedi quoted Sonia as having told the meeting. ìShe also said that Rahul will lead the election campaign, which in a way makes it clear that the future leadership is with him,î Dwivedi said. The decision will be reflected in the resolution the AICC will adopt on Friday. ìThis meeting of the AICC declares that the 2014 election campaign will be led by Rahul Gandhi,î it will say.

140,"NEW DELHI: The government today unveiled new policy guidelines for major ports, aimed at helping them leverage their land resources for commercial advantage. Twelve major ports in India have between them 2.64 lakh acres of land, which is a major resource. ""So far, the land utilisation has not been optimum and often yielded lesser returns. The thrust of the new policy has been on linking the value of land with prevailing market rates,"" an official statement said. The statement said Shipping Secretary Vishwapati Trivedi while participating in the 'Ports in India' annual conference in Mumbai said the new guidelines provide necessary regulatory framework for land allotment by major ports. These guidelines have been drawn to help the ports to carry out leasing and licencing of port land in a transparent manner, the statement quoted Trivedi as saying. Discretionary powers have been reduced and tender-cum-auction has been prescribed as most preferred method of allotment, he added. Under the new policy guidelines, land can be allotted only through licensing in custom bond areas by inviting competitive bidding, while land outside custom bond areas can be leased through tender-cum-auction. There is also a provision to license land outside custom bond areas, but it should be only for port related activities. ""The Boards of respective ports can approve leasing of land for a period up to 30 years. For leasing of land beyond 30 years and up to 99 years, approval of the Government has to be obtained through the mechanism of Empowered Committee,"" the statement said. All the 12 major ports of the country are required to draw land use plan covering all land owned or managed by them. The new guidelines are applicable to all major ports in India except for the land relating to township areas in Mumbai, Kolkata and Kandla, it added. The new policy guidelines for land management are part of the on going process of port reforms and liberalisation. While major ports, owned by the Centre operate in a comparatively more regulated environment, the non-major ports, comprising state ports and private ports enjoy substantial degree of flexibility. The statement said the government has been working towards creating a level playing field for major and non-major ports. Earlier, in 2013, as a part of reform process in the Ports sector tariff setting in major ports was liberalised and indexed to inflation and minimum efficiency standards were prescribed for cargo terminals. During 2013-14, it is planned to augment port capacity by 220 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) through 30 port projects. Out of these 20 port projects, with a capacity of 100 MTPA have already been approved.

The court, however, made it clear the injunction will apply only until it hears the matter fully from February 24. Justice Manmohan Singh also held that the observations made in the order were ìprima facie in natureî and would not stop the media from reporting court cases and events as facts covered under the ambit of fair reporting ìon the basis of true, correct and verified informationî. The 42-page order of the court came in response to an application by Kumar, presently the chief of the National Green Tribunal, to restrain the media from reporting the allegations against him by a† former law intern. Kumar had also filed a defamation case against The Indian Express, a senior reporter of the paper, Times Now, CNN-IBN and the former intern. The court also issued a temporary injunction on all media organizations, restricting them from publishing photographs of the retired judge ìwhich may suggest connection of the plaintiff with the said allegationsî. Taking note of the articles published in The Indian Express and the debates on the two TV channels between January 11 and 13, the court held that the media was restrained from publishing any article or write-up or telecasting programmes that highlight the allegations against Kumar in the form of headlines connecting or associating him with those allegations, particularly without disclosing in the headline that they are mere allegations against him, or any other similar articles or TV programmes. The court also observed that news reports in multiple newspapers and TV channels ìmake out a strong prima facie caseî for granting the injunction sought by the former judge, and directed the media organizations to ìdelete the offending contentî on the internet or other electronic media ìwithin 24 hoursî. The court accepted Kumarís argument that the allegations against him were as yet not verified and he had not been investigated or tried in any manner. ìI find that the plaintiff has been able to make out a strong prima facie case on the basis of the disclosure of the material available on recordÖand the CDs. which clearly show that the defendants have published the write-ups and telecasted by highlighting the allegations on the front page in order to create sensation amongst public and made it apparent by creating the impression that the plaintiff in all probability is involved in such incident,î the court said. ìPrima facie, I find that the publicationsÖconnect the plaintiff with such allegations in the manner which creates a trial by media kind of situation by creating a sensation amongst the public by highlighting and underscoring mere allegations on the front pages of daily routine news and thus the same or similar nature of publications are required to be postponed,î the court held. Cautioning the media against what it said was ìexcessive adverse publicityî, the court has also held that such publication could be curtailed by the courts ìeven if some kind of fairness is ascribed to the publicationî because it would hamper a fair trial. ìIt may also result in creating an atmosphere in the form of public opinion wherein a person may not be able to put forward his defence properly and his likelihood of getting fair trial would be seriously impaired,î it said.

Nine pacts in wide-ranging fields including cyber space cooperation were inked after the talks between Singh and South Korean President Park Geun-hye during which both leaders discussed ways to promote bilateral relations and exchanged views on a number of regional and international issues. After the talks, Singh said negotiations for revision of the existing Double Taxation Avoidance Convention have concluded. ""We have just concluded wide-ranging discussion on matters of bilateral interest and regional and global importance. This has enabled us to impart further substance, greater content and new momentum to the Strategic Partnership between our two countries,"" Singh said at a joint media event with Park. He said both the leaders have decided to establish an annual interaction between the ""national security structures"" of the two countries besides agreeing to launch a Cyber Affairs Dialogue. ""I am happy that the large-scale POSCO steel project in Odisha is set to be operational in the coming weeks, following the revalidation of its environmental clearance. Grant of mining concession for the project is also at an advanced stage of processing. I conveyed to President Park our hope that this project will confirm that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand,"" Singh said. During the talks, both the sides recognised the possibility of defence trade and joint production of military equipment by further promoting collaboration between our defence research organisations.

""Sluggish economic growth and high interest rates are being touted as primary drivers for rising bad loans and if the economic scenario continues there is no doubt that asset quality would suffer further,"" said the study. Other factors like delays in obtaining statutory and other approvals as well as lax credit appraisal and complacency in monitoring by banks are also responsible for deteriorating asset quality. The asset quality of banks has deteriorated in the aftermath global economic crisis of 2008.

However, they have shown an upward trend since March 2008, Assocham said. Besides, the ratio of gross NPA to advances for banks increased significantly, from 2.36 per cent in March 2011 to 3.92 per cent in June 2013, it added.

153,"NEW DELHI: The country is likely to soon permit more wheat exports as the world's second-biggest producer of the grain looks set to harvest a record crop this year, government sources said, swelling stockpiles in an oversupplied world market . The country is extremely cautious about allowing exports of wheat, a staple for its 1.2 billion population, and lifted a four-year-old ban on shipments in 2011 by allowing only private traders to sell on the world market. But a succession of bumper crops and poor storage conditions that have led to substantial wastage have prompted a rethink on exports. Since last fiscal year India has exported nearly 4.5 million tonnes of wheat from state warehouses, and state-backed traders are now selling another 2 million tonnes via tenders. Any extra supplies from India, though, could dampen Chicago prices which have fallen around 9 per cent in the past month due to rising global supplies. Leading producer Ukraine has already raised its 2013 grains output forecast to a record. ""In all likelihood, the crop is going to be an all-time high so more exports are almost certain now,"" said an Indian government source directly involved in the decision-making process. ""But we are yet to take a call on the quantity to be shipped out."" Of the 2 million tonnes of wheat currently allowed for exports from government warehouses, state-run traders have already sold almost a million tonnes. Three government-backed traders - State Trading Corp. , MMTC Ltd and PEC - are getting good response in their tenders after the government in October cut the floor price for exports to $260 a tonne to boost shipments. Any decision on additional exports could come in March. ""Most likely a formal decision for more exports will come when another one million tonnes will be sold out. By then, we will also get a clear idea about the crop size,"" said another government source who is also a decision-making authority. Farmers grow only one wheat crop in a year, with planting in October-September and harvests from March. This spring farmers would harvest more than 100 million tonnes, Farm Minister Sharad Pawar said on Wednesday, the seventh consecutive wheat crop to exceed demand. In 2013, India produced 94.88 million tonnes. A jump in the area planted with wheat and favourable weather conditions are the main reasons behind expectations of a record crop in the country which needs 76-77 million tonnes of wheat a year to feed its population. Farmers have planted wheat on a record 31.14 million hectares, up from 29.65 million hectares in the previous year, said Indu Sharma, chief of the state-run Directorate of Wheat Research in Haryana, a major wheat growing state. ""Crop condition is excellent. Colour is good. There are signs that the crop will be more than 100 million tonnes,"" Sharma said. The government buys grains from local farmers at fixed prices to protect them from any distress sale and build stockpiles to sell subsidised food to the poor. Bumper harvests mean more stocks at government warehouses. On Jan. 1, wheat stocks at state-run warehouses were 28.0 million tonnes, substantially higher than a target of 8.2 million tonnes.",Government likely to allow more wheat exports soon as record crop eyed - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/government-likely-to-allow-more-wheat-exports-soon-as-record-crop-eyed/articleshow/28891659.cms
154,"The wake-up call from the AAP that halted the BJP in its tracks in Delhi appears to have finally awakened the Sangh Parivar. The story of the relationship between state and private enterprise needs a rewrite. Our contemporary moment seems fraught with both possibility and anxiety. A new social contract will be institutionalised in the next couple of years. But we donít know the shape of this contract. Learning by doing, compromising to get a workable consensus are, to some extent, inevitable. But we are in the midst of defining new relationships between public and private that will require us to return to a new framework. In 1991, a simple framework became a guiding template for a renegotiation between the public and the private sector. The private sector was to be freed, its productive and competitive energies were to be unleashed. The gains from the resulting growth would not just trickle down, they would also provide resources for the state to help citizens who could not, in their current circumstances, participate in the gains of growth. The basic idea, only imperfectly realised, was not on the wrong track. But it turned out to be a limiting template in several ways. First, our understanding of the relationship between the state and private enterprise turned out to be too simplistic. This was partly because the fascination with the private sector did not come from a story about its virtues; it came as a negative reaction to state failure. Since the public sector was full of vice, as it were, the opposite, namely the private sector, must be full of virtue. This sensibility underwrote the great reforms of the period: ending the licence permit raj, greater integration with the global economy. But it neglected key issues in the relationship between public and private. First, there was the question of an appropriate regulatory structure. As the recent Delhi High Court judgment allowing for government audit of private telecom companies has reminded us, the issue of an interface between the state and private companies is more complex than a pure ownership story would suggest. In the United States, these kinds of audits of private utility companies, for instance, are routine and far more invasive than in India. Much of the debate over public and private in India is based on a simplistic conception of ownership: private, therefore exempt; public, therefore accountable. Yet the issue of accountability is now based not on ownership, but function. If you are a private monopoly in utilities, the fact that you are private is neither here nor there: your costing will have to be audited. Public-private partnerships have been a success in areas like infrastructure; they have been oversold in other areas, like education. But if 50 per cent of government expenditure is routed through these partnerships, it will be hard to make the argument that this expenditure should be exempt from public accountability. The public-private debate will now have to move to a whole new level of sophistication. To use a phrase central to the reforms process, instead of a pitched battle between public and private, both will have to be ìunbundledî. Rather than thinking of the private as always a default substitute for public failure, we will have to carefully think about what institutional form is likely to succeed under what conditions. As the Delhi High Court noted, the real issue is going to be whether both sides learn sensible norms appropriate to this regulation, or whether this ends in a combat of mutual suspicion. The danger is that much of the rhetoric, from both companies and political parties, increases risks of the latter. The second aspect of the liberalisation story was that we ignored the costing of negative externalities that impinge on the public-private relationship. The environment is a classic case, where we are producing a near irretrievable disaster. Unfortunately, this message is still not getting through. So you have both spectacles in progress. On one hand, there is the government, trying to speed up clearances. On the other hand, the regulatory framework is multiplying, with the Supreme Court mandating the creation of state-level environmental regulators just last week. Again, will we get a new social contract or the logjams of mutual suspicion? You can run a similar story across every sector. Our laws on social regulation bear the marks of mutual suspicion rather than reasonable agreement. Our debate on taxation is taking a similar turn. There are two issues. The first is the institutional architecture, centred on simplicity and ease of enforcement. As the fiscal deficit got worse, the tax authorities got even more licence to be arbitrary, leading to the same argument: is taxation about reasonably justified mutual obligations or is it doomed to be an extreme contest between arbitrariness on one hand and evasion on the other? But most fundamentally, the issue of fairness has come up again. Whining about tax burdens is inevitable. Unfortunately, the debate has got complicated because we do not have a clear public-private framework. So, on one hand, there are several irrational subsidies. On the other hand, the things most capitalist states provide ó health, education, water, in many cases, transport and even security ó are available through private provision. What is the public-private interface in these sectors? In education, we ended up with a regime that neither rejuvenated public institutions, nor unleashed the full advantages of the private. Accountability in healthcare will be the next frontier issue in politics. But a deeper issue is this. While we need to strengthen the state in so many ways, there is no short cut around it. At the same time, the cost of an extraordinary privatisation of services may be undermining the willingness to support the state. It is one thing for the state to have a taxation debate in a context where it could assure the middle classes that there is a reasonably priced, good quality university they could access. It is another to do it in a context where anxiety over how much you will have to pay for health or education wrecks the system. A similar argument could be made for another place where we have got the public-private mix wrong. Labour regulation, in some areas, impeded formalisation and job creation. Yet it would be easier to argue for different labour laws if there was some other, effective social protection. We grasped correctly that corruption had stripped away trust across the board. It corroded the legitimacy of every institution, making solutions harder. Both growth and justice were casualties. But are we ready for a more sophisticated negotiation on the balance between public and private? To paraphrase Vivekanada, we have arisen, we are awake. But we still need to decide whether this revolution will get the public-private relationship right.

Preventing other countries from intervening in its disputes with Pakistan has long been a major objective of Indiaís foreign policy. New Delhi goes to great lengths to make sure third parties are either neutral or tilt in Indiaís favour. Any sense of empathy for Pakistan, real or perceived, on the question of Indiaís territorial sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir, for example, has often complicated Indiaís relations with China, the United States, Britain, western Europe and the Muslim world in general. As it receives the president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, this week and hosts Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, as an honoured guest during the Republic Day celebrations later this month, Delhi has a different problem. It is about responding to mounting territorial tensions among Indiaís East Asian neighbours. One set of disputes involves Chinaís expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea against many of its Southeast Asian neighbours. This conflict is expressing itself most visibly in the current military tension between China on the one hand, and Vietnam and the Philippines on the other. It has escalated another notch in the new year with the Chinese demand that all ìforeignî fishing operations in the South China Sea must get explicit permission from Beijing. China and Japan are locked in another dispute in the East China Sea. Their contest over tiny islands, called Senkaku in Tokyo and Diaoyu in Beijing, has brought the militaries of the two nations face to face on a routine basis. Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea are squabbling over small islets in the Sea of Japan, also called the East Sea. The rocks are called Dokdo in Seoul and Takeshima in Tokyo. Further up north, a fourth dispute involves Japan and Russia over an island chain called Kuriles in Moscow and the Northern Territories in Tokyo. DELHI MUTED. As in South Asia, where political emotions rise at the very mention of Kashmir, maritime territorial disputes have now fanned the flames of nationalism in East Asia. Unlike in the subcontinent, the East Asian neighbours donít even agree on the names of the disputed island territories. All countries marshal impressive historical and legal arguments to justify their claims. Their leaders say there is no domestic political room at all for compromise. As all these disputes acquire a new intensity, Chinaís neighbours, increasingly worried about Beijingís assertiveness, are seeking strong support from third parties, including India. Some would think this is hardly a problem. Given Indiaís own territorial disputes with China and Beijingís support to Pakistan on Kashmir, Delhi, it would seem, should be backing its friends in Tokyo, Hanoi and Manila. And where a dispute involves two of its friends, for example, Japan and South Korea or Moscow and Tokyo, Delhi must encourage political accommodation.

156,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. The RBIís mandate-driven approach has constricted financial inclusion. A Reserve Bank of India panel has submitted a report on financial inclusion. It proposes that priority sector lending by banks be raised and that banks be mandated to open accounts for every adult Indian by January 2016. The recommendations do not challenge the RBIís basic approach to financial inclusion. This approach, which has been to mandate banks to undertake financial inclusion, might have spread public sector bank branches in rural areas for some years, helped open bank accounts and directed credit, but it has stopped yielding results. What India needs is a new approach, which encourages competition and innovation, rather than more mandates. Indiaís approach to financial inclusion has been bank-centric. So far, it has focused on bank nationalisation, continued with government ownership of banks and their recapitalisation. The way to ensure inclusion has been priority sector lending, which mandates that 40 per cent of each bankís lending be to weaker sectors ó small-scale industries, agriculture and exports ó to which the bank might not have lent otherwise. The RBI panel now recommends raising this share to 50 per cent. The panelís recommendations are in sync with the RBIís recent guidelines for the grant of licences to new banks. These require that the bank have a plan for financial inclusion and that it open 25 per cent of its branches in unbanked rural areas. This approach is similar to the one that required PSU banks to open rural branches. By once again mandating financial inclusion, this time for private sector licence applications, instead of focusing on competition and innovation, the RBI is essentially doing more of the same. Financial inclusion may be defined as access to a range of financial services in a convenient, flexible, reliable and continuous manner from formal, regulated financial institutions. Even though access can be ensured by mandates, the quality parameters of access may be compromised in the process. This is seen in the low usage of accounts and the poor asset quality of priority sector portfolios. Such inclusion confuses ends with means. A bank account is meant to fulfil certain functions ó simply opening an account is not enough. The panel proposes to make it mandatory for every Indian over the age of 18 to have a bank account. An often overlooked consequence of the mandate-driven approach to inclusion, as pursued by the RBI, is that the costs of this inclusion are levied on the investors and consumers of banks. The losses from unused bank accounts and poorly performing priority sector assets are eventually borne by the investors and consumers. If the political objective of opening bank accounts is to be met, or lending to certain sectors ensured, it should be transparent as a line item on the governmentís budget. Instead, it is done through a cross-subsidy that effectively makes other customers pay for the political goals of a government pushing its agenda through banks. This approach has been accompanied by a neglect of the other drivers of inclusion ó competition and innovation. In the last 11 years, the Indian economy has grown rapidly, but no banking licences have been given in this time. The trend has been that once a decade, the RBI decides to give a few licences, but there is no window to get licences during this period. The incumbent banks feel little or no pressure to reach out to unbanked areas and people with their services. This, in turn, necessitates a mandate-driven approach to financial inclusion. Despite decades of RBI mandates, rural customers turn to informal channels and unregulated financial firms. As part of the RBIís bank-centric approach, there are regulatory and entry barriers to prevent bank-like institutional mechanisms from competing with banks. For example, money market mutual funds, a viable alternative to bank deposits and popular in countries such as the US, are not allowed to issue cheques by the RBI, which also regulates the payments system. This reduces competition to banking. These barriers help generate complacency among banks and curb the extent to which new business models emerge. The mandate-driven approach to financial inclusion has also been a key hindrance to innovation. The RBI has emphasised specific quantitative targets, such as priority sector lending or opening bank accounts. Lately, appointing customer service providers has been added. A consequence of these mandates is that the rural business departments of banks are too busy trying to meet the targets to spend time and effort in actual innovation that serves the consumers. A comprehensive change in regulatory philosophy is required to bring about meaningful financial inclusion in India. This would entail a shift from the present bank-centric, mandate-driven approach to an emphasis on competition, innovation and consumer protection as the pillars of regulatory philosophy. The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission has recommended an approach to financial regulation that is based on these three pillars. To encourage competition, the RBI should not decide the optimal number of banks for the country. Bank licences should be available on tap, based on reasonable eligibility criteria. The RBI should also permit the emergence of new business models in banking, non-bank lending and payments. An increase in competition should encourage existing banks and newcomers to explore opportunities beyond the markets that have already been served. The second pillar is allowing innovation to happen. The RBIís present approach prohibits innovation until it is expressly permitted. This approach has led to delayed innovation across all products and processes. For example, the business correspondent model, which enables the delivery of banking services through low cost agents, was introduced more than a decade after it made headway in comparable emerging markets. The RBI must shift to an approach that allows innovation to happen and then responds with proportionate regulations. Increased competition and innovation must be accompanied by consumer protection, acknowledging the imperfections in financial markets. The idea of financial inclusion must not be limited to getting access. This access must help consumers use finance in beneficial ways, with the regulator protecting them from unfair contracts and terms. Consumer protection also translates into proportionate regulation to maintain the safety and soundness of financial service providers. A bank or an insurance company must be managed prudently enough to minimise the probability of failure. The failure probability need not be zero, for that would lead to excessive conservatism. Once in a while, when a financial firm fails, it should be resolved in a manner that entails the least pain for the consumers. India needs a new approach to financial innovation and it is time the RBI realised that more of its mandate-driven approach is not the solution. The writer, RBI Chair.

157,"The politics of†Manmohanomics. Figures show that more than 20 years of economic reforms, initiated by Singh but pursued by all governments, in spite of corrective mechanisms such as the MGNREGA, have resulted in greater inequality. IE. Summary. The middle class that has benefited the most is also Singhís biggest critic. Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. The middle class that has benefited the most is also Singhís biggest critic. In his latest press conference, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that ìhistory will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in Parliamentî. He is probably right, not only because he is the first PM since Jawaharlal Nehru to complete two five-year terms in a row, but also because Singh has had a huge impact on Indian society by orchestrating major economic reforms from 1991 onwards. The man is also refreshingly modest. But itís time to take stock not only of the achievements, but also the limitations of almost 23 years of ìManmohanomicsî. One of the basic assumptions during the dismantling of the licence/ permit raj era in the 1990s, when the state-owned economic model had clearly exhausted its potential, harked back to the trickle-down theory. This theory holds that once liberalisation measures re-energise private sector entrepreneurship, a rise in the growth rate also benefits the bottom of the pyramid. The question is how much the bottom benefits. In his first speech after taking over as president, Pranab Mukherjee declared in July 2012 that ìtrickle-down theories do not address the legitimate aspirations of the poorî. What kind of indicators can we use to substantiate this claim ó or its opposite? The controversy around the poverty line suggests that a simple evaluation based on the numbers of absolute poor may not be the most suitable. It is also not the most relevant measure of inequality, which is key to test the validity of the trickle-down theory. Certainly, the percentage of Indians below the poverty line declined from 37 per cent in 2004-05 to 29.8 per cent in 2009-10. But has the gap between rich and poor narrowed? How much wealth has really percolated down? To answer such questions, it is preferable to rely on National Sample Survey Organisation data and more specifically, to its calculation of monthly per capita expenditures (MPCE). This indicator offers an instrument by which to measure the evolution of the standard of living and of inequality. In 1993-94, the average MPCE was Rs 281 in rural India and Rs 458 in urban India. They rose, respectively, to Rs 772 (+174 per cent) and Rs 1,472 (+221 per cent) in 2007-08, which means that the gap between urban and rural areas has jumped from 63 to 91 per cent.The gap diminished somewhat between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with rural MPCE reaching Rs 1,430 (+85 per cent) and urban MPCE rising to Rs 2,630 (+79 per cent), but it remained more than 20 percentage points higher than what it was in 1993-94, at 84 per cent. The gap between rural and urban areas has become particularly pronounced in states where cities have boomed, like Karnataka, with the Bangalore phenomenon, and where, the gap between rural and urban MPCE has increased from 57 to 93.5 per cent. But we must look beyond the urban/ rural divide and examine the increasingly alarming difference that exists among villages state-wise. If we concentrate on the 15 largest states of India, we see that in 1993-94, the rural MPCE of those above average (Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Kerala), all located in the south and west, was Rs 345, when the rural MPCE of the states below average (Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Assam and Bihar), was Rs 255. Almost 20 years later, in 2011-12, the rural MPCE of the above average states (the same as in 1993-94, plus Karnataka and Maharashtra, which have improved) jumped to Rs 1,883, while that of the others (the same as in 1993-94, including the newly created Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh) was only Rs 1,122. This means that the gap between villages in the richest parts of rural India and those in the poorest parts of rural India has jumped from 35 to 68 per cent. The situation has not changed so dramatically in urban India, but the trend is the same. In 1993-94, the MPCE of the above average states (Haryana, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Assam, Punjab and Kerala) was Rs 490, whereas in those below average (Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Bihar), it was Rs 360. In 2011-12, the urban MPCE of the above average states (the same as in 1993-94, plus Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and minus Assam and West Bengal) was Rs 3,153, whereas in those below average, it was Rs 2,170. This means that the gap between citizens in the richest parts of urban India and those in the poorest parts of urban India has increased from 36 to 45 per cent. These figures show that more than 20 years of economic reforms, initiated by Singh but pursued by all governments, in spite of corrective mechanisms such as the MGNREGA, have resulted in greater inequality. This trend is in contrast to the decade between 1983 and 1993-94, when the percentage of those below the poverty line declined by 9.8 percentage points, while it was reduced by only 8.3 percentage points over the following 10 years. This is quite understandable. First, rural residents were bound to lag behind given the slow growth of agriculture. Over the years 2005-06 and 2011-12, the average annual growth rate of industry at 2004-05 prices has been 7.5 per cent, while services grew at an ever-quicker pace ó 9.95 per cent. Agriculture lagged behind at 3.8 per cent. These figures reflect the governmentís lack of interest in agriculture, which has resulted in declining investment (in irrigation, for instance) and diminishing subsidies (for instance, for fertilisers). Second, liberalisation allows those who have some capital ó be it in terms of education, land or money ó to invest and flourish while others have to wait for the trickle-down effect. Now, this percolation is only possible in geographical terms when the rich can invest where the poor live. Logically, they should be incentivised to do so the moment the cost of labour rises in the most developed parts of the country, but infrastructure (electricity, roads) is often lacking elsewhere. Instead, the poor go to the richest areas, as migration flows show. The rise of inequality in India may not be what Singh will be remembered for in history, but it has probably been the most striking consequence of the trickle-down theory. After two decades of liberalisation, investment in agriculture and infrastructure is key. Only the state can undertake such investment. The fiscal reform that would make it possible may well be the need of the day to create jobs, not only in the cities where industry needs to grow, but also in villages. Ironically, the very same middle class that has benefited most from Manmohanomics, as evident from the social inequalities described above, is the most critical of Singh.

158,"NEW YORK: A federal judge on Thursday rejected Apple's request for more time to comply with a ruling on e-book price-fixing , while chastising the company for failing to cooperate with a court-appointed monitor. US District Judge Denise Cote denied Apple's request to delay enforcement of the order that stems from a ruling in July that Apple illegally colluded with book publishers to fix prices. She gave Apple only until Monday to accept compliance, but said it could get an extension from an appellate court if it files a request by Saturday. An Apple attorney, Theodore Boutrous, said an appeal would be filed. The judge's 64-page order harshly criticized Apple for failing to work with the court-appointed monitor, former prosecutor Michael Bromwich, and said she appointed him only after Apple made it clear it would not reform its practices on its own. ""The court created breathing room for Apple to unilaterally revise and improve its compliance program, even after Apple had failed to take the opportunities which were given to it this past summer to show that it would do so without the imposition of a monitor,"" Cote wrote. ""That said, the monitor has important work to do, and where that work properly includes interviews of board members or executives, then the monitor must be permitted to conduct those interviews."" The judge said Apple failed to show it would be ""irreparably harmed"" by complying with the court order or with the monitor. She said that since the monitor began work three months ago, Apple has permitted only 13 hours of interviews, and that seven of the 11 people interviewed were attorneys. ""A monitorship would be of little use at all if a monitor were only permitted to receive, review and opine on company-vetted documents,"" the judge said. ""Apple cites to no case holding that a monitor may never conduct interviews and there are many examples to the contrary."" The Northern California-based maker of iPads, iPods, iPhones and Macintosh computers has a had a strained relationship with Bromwich since he was appointed. The company protested Bromwich's intent to question chief executive Tim Cook , lead designer Jony Ive, board member Al Gore and other top executives who aren't involved in day-to-day operations. Apple also objected to the $1,100 hourly rate for himself and the $1,025 rate for his legal support team. Judge Cote said Apple must raise any objections with Bromwich himself or the Department of Justice, and if they cannot resolve the matter, by petitioning the court. ""The deterioration of the relationship between Apple and the monitor is unfortunate and disappointing,"" she said. ""Hopefully, that relationship can be 'reset' and placed on a productive course. But it is strongly in the public's interest for the monitor to remain in place."" The trial focused on a six-week period in late 2009 and early 2010 during which Apple negotiated contracts with publishers ahead of its iPad launch and effectively reshaped the market for electronic books with a new pricing scheme.",Judge chides Apple for blocking e-book monitor - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/judge-chides-apple-for-blocking-e-book-monitor/articleshow/28906000.cms
159,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. Three individuals will set the agenda for the general elections. In Indian mythology, the Trimurti referred to the three gods of Hinduism; Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Sustainer, and Shiva the Destroyer. Hereís a thought. The triad and their titles, in many ways, have a connect to the three leaders who will set the agenda for the Lok Sabha elections next summer. Narendra Modi, recently charged by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with being a destroyer, Arvind Kejriwal, who has created a potentially gamechanging political force out of nothing, and Rahul Gandhi, who, of late, has started to establish a more substantial, sustainable image by taking a clearer stand on issues that matter to the voting public, and not just sections of it. The fact that the triumvirate who will dominate the coming polls are so different from the choices we have had in all previous elections, makes it not just a tantalising prospec but also a huge leap in terms of its potential for positive change. Kejriwal stormed Delhiís citadels with just one key weapon: corruption. Gandhi may not yet be the official candidate but he will set the agenda for the Congress. Till recently, that agenda was largely indeterminate and ad hoc, leaving the public wondering whether he lacked a coherent vision. In the last month, he has grasped the political nettle and made it clear that his main focus will be anti-corruption, taking a leaf from Kejriwalís book. Modi has also railed against corruption, albeit in an anti-Congress context, in all his election-related speeches so far. All three key players on an anti-corruption platform cannot be a bad thing for our democracy. There is also the age factor and thought process. Kejriwal is 45, Gandhi is 43, so both belong to a different generation than the current leadership in the two main parties. Modi may be 63, but he thinks out of the box and makes use of a young manís tools, social media. Plus, he has repeatedly stressed the importance of Indiaís youth and the democratic dividend they offer. Kejriwal is an IIT graduate and his engineering background has given him a logical, clearsighted thought process. He may be the most unconventional leader we have, but his aim is to change politics from within, and that alone, has set him up in the eyes of many as the future hope for the country. He remains, of course, the most unpredictable of the three. It is still not clear how his party will make the leap to the national stage and retain its core electoral attraction, cleanliness in politics, a rejection of traditional political culture and decentralisation of decision-making and authority. He is surrounded by a group of first-timers in politics who, at times, struggle to deal with the reality of their newly acquired status. That may not last and once the nerves and jitters subside, we should have a clearer idea of where the party is headed in terms of forging a national identity. Itís clearly too early to say what national appeal it will have come election 2014, but the party has already grabbed the media spotlight from others, and it is now for the rest to play catch-up. In a sense, their phenomenal debut suggests they have already set the agenda for 2014. The trioís change-making potential lies the most in the economic and corporate sphere. Modi is already established as pro-business, pro-development and is widely expected to further liberalise the economy. His image in Gujarat has been of an efficient leader who is able to motivate the bureaucracy and bend them to his will. More recently, he has spoken about the urgent need for tax reforms. There is no question that he will create a more favourable business climate should he come to power. Gandhiís earlier ambiguity on economic issues has given way to a clearer enunciation of where he stands, most notably at the recent speech to business leaders at FICCI, where he talked of time-bound decisions on infrastructure projects, balancing environmental clearances with industry needs, fast-tracking clearances through the Cabinet Committee on Investment, building a robust and open real estate market and a framework of legislation to fight corruption. Kejriwal is the dark horse. Most see him as a quasi-Marxist. He has adopted a spin-off of the Gandhian concept of swaraj, which lays stress on self-governance, community-building and decentralisation of power. However, he has also said that: ìIf we find our solution in the Left we are happy to borrow it from there. If we find our solution in the Right, we are happy to borrow it from there.î Kejriwal may not be a candidate in the Lok Sabha elections but his influence is spreading across the country and it will inspire other leaders to read from his script, mainly to minimise corruption and influence peddling, introduce transparency in government and create a level playing field. The battle is not yet joined, Modi and Gandhi come with heavy baggage, and much could change between now and the elections. But based on early evidence, the political Trimurti lording over Election 2014 will be in a position to make a positive impact on an increasingly discredited Indian polity and an economy under emergency care.",The triad of promise | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-triad-of-promise/

161,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. The national political mood is very febrile. The two big old parties had settled down to their usual battle on the secular/communalist border. Now there is a new kid on the block and the oldies are uncertain as to what the battle is about. But even so, they never miss an opportunity to miss the bus whenever the M (minority/Muslim) issue comes up. Something about the M issue makes their minds go numb and they settle into fixed positions whatever the facts. The recent news that the Lashkar-e-Toiba was found recruiting in Muzaffarnagar had one simple fact that could have been celebrated; namely that the LeT did not succeed in recruiting anyone. Local Muslims did not behave like cardboard characters in the way both the Congress and BJP have made them out to be. Rahul Gandhi had jumped the gun and given us a garbled version of the story. His aim was to point a† finger at the BJP, which had allegedly fomented the riot and alienated local Muslims, so that they were soft targets for the LeT. Not to be left behind, the BJP is breathing fire about lapses in national security when all that has actually happened is that LeT operatives were caught thanks to the locals in UP. Rejoice! Pakistanís simplistic views about Indian Muslims are disproved. The Aam Aadmi Party has also fallen foul of not adopting the simplistic view of India which the older parties have. When it comes to Kashmir, the older parties have a schizophrenic view. Kashmir is an integral part of India but unlike any other part of India, no discussion is allowed about its people. Prashant Bhushan, who is not an ignoramus (as he has been portrayed), wondered whether the people of J&K had a view about the† presence of the Army and AFSPA. This is a question over which Irom Sharmila has been fasting for many long years. We have reports that people living under AFSPA do not like it. Why can someone not raise such a question? Is India so touchy about Kashmir that it is beyond discussion? Why does the junior gang of the Sangh Parivar feel it necessary to vandalise the offices of AAP? Is this going to be a regular if the BJP comes to power? Let us hope not. But that may be why the old style of politics is looking so old. The older parties are still dealing with Partition. Both have problems about viewing Indians as Indians. Indians for them† are Hindus, minorities or Muslims, and the nondescript rest who may be minorities but cannot be called so.

162,"NEW DELHI: Employees consider that flexible working hours at workplace can attract and retain top staff, a move that can also optimise businesses profitability of the companies, says a survey by global workplace provider Regus. The survey, conducted among over 20,000 executives across 95 countries, noted that flexible working can be used to avoid employee churn as 73 per cent of the respondents believe that flexible working is a perk that attracts top talent. A staggering 75 per cent confirm that flexible working also improves staff retention. ""Hiring and retaining top talent is an age-old priority for successful businesses, but not all companies can afford to offer golden bonuses or mouth-watering salaries while remaining competitive. Many employees consider that offering flexible working is often the ""make-or-break"" of job offers as 73 per cent of the respondents revealed that they would choose one job over another similar one, if it offered flexible working. ""Flexible working offers attractive perks of lower stress and better work-life balance to existing and prospective employees and provides a low cost solution to attracting and retaining those top workers. It is striking how mainstream the perk of flexible working has become, with many respondents actually choosing their jobs on the basis of flexibility,"" he added.

For me, the sign of a successful film is that it should have repeat value even after 10 or 20 years. Like, how we refer to ëSholayí, ëKabhie Kabhieí, ëMughal-E-Azamí todayÖthey are iconic films.

I work from heart and give my best. I work very hard for all my films and the fate of the films are beyond your control,î she said. Her onscreen chemistry with Shah Rukh has been appreciated by everyone. ìWe have been lucky in terms of scripts that we got.

Director Abhishek Choubeyís debut film had an arresting swagger and a distinct voice, and charactersófull-blooded, full-bodiedñ that stayed with you much after the film was over. The sequel has the same two losers, a little worn and weathered, trying their luck in another town, and two new ladies, holding out the promise of one-and-half-times the fun. Fun it is for some time, and then it starts to slide. This one should have been a humdinger, but it falls short. ëDedh Ishqiyaí opens with a great mood, and a ëtameezdaar, ghumaavdaarí Urdu `lehjaí which has vanished from the movies, with Naseeruddin and Arshad appearing to be in as much fine nick as in the first film. And for a while, it all goes swimmingly. The made-up town of Mahmudabad takes you back to a time when there were `nawaabsí, and ënazaakatí, and a perennial `mushaairaí swarming with potential poets desirous of grasping the hands of beautiful women. Itís got crackling atmosphere, this town in which our Khaalu ( Naseer) and Babban ( Warsi) arrive, both as usual on the run. The centre of action is in a ramshackle `havelií whose run-downness hints at how grand it used to be, especially now that its resident, the still-lovely, gracefully ageing Begum Para ( Dixit), has decided to choose a partner. Khaalu, all done up in a rented `sherwanií wants to be that man, and not only because he sees Begum Para as his meal ticket, but also because there is history between them. Nothing is simple, though, as twisted feelings simmer below the surface. The Begumís constant companion, the much younger Muniyaa (Huma Qureshi) is busy plotting a kidnapping, and keeping the lusty Babban at bay. But the real competition comes from a love-lorn Jaan Mohammad (Vijay Raaz), who has deep feelings for the Begum. The second half dips, and it all becomes a bit too languid, even if things rev up towards the end. There is much to be liked in the film, and I wish all of it had been as good as the scintillating bits. The trouble is not just with the pace.

169,"ëYaariyaní is meant to be many things as we keep discovering as we are dragged along its unending length. A youthful college film. A patriotic film that waves the Indian flag in faraway Australia and our own Sikkim. A love story with a fresh pair. And a container for some popular songs. Of all the boxes it tries to tick, this exhausting two-and-a-half hour product does best with the last one. Because for the others, there needed to have been a plot. Which is non-existent. ëYaariyaní seems to have been cobbled together from ëMain Hoon Naí and ëF A L T Uí, and ëStudent Of The Yearí, even going back to ëJo Jeeta Wohi Sikandarí. If you can find other sources of ëinspirationí, please add in. The college is set in ëSikkimí (because it is big enough to straddle the whole state, maybe?), and is populated by girls who are only bothered about their looks, and boys who are never seen with books. Classes, whatís that? The studious Saloni (Preet Singh) is a ëbehenjií; the other ëgirlsí are to be seen in hot pants and tank tops, looking as if theyíve stepped off a particularly garish ramp. Lakshya (Kohli) has a widowed mother and an Armyman father who gave up his life for the country. The heroís best friend goes off to Australia, leaving behind his teary mother (Naval), solely to be the victim of a ëracial attackí. Apart from making a comment on ëracismí, some parts of the film are shot on an Aussie beach, just so they show us an Aussie lass (Evelyn) in a red bikini. A couple of moronic types pass off as teachers, with poor Gulshan Grover having to play ëprincipalí to this unappetizing bunch. And of course thereís got to be that one mincing guy with a limp wrist : if I had to stop and count out the offenses, major and mild, that this tripe piles up, Iíd run out of space, so I will leave it here.

Lake Isle Press, the publisher, says on its website Khanna has done all the food and travel photography himself, as in his previous book Flavors First, and that the inspiration for his journey through the Himalayan river valleys was a chance meeting with the Dalai Lama. A 2012 blog post on the site describes the behind-the- scenes process of making the cookbook during its manuscript phase. ìIn the interest of authenticity, I have tried to preserve most of the recipes the way I found them and only made slight adjustments to make it possible to recreate them in a Western kitchen.

World number one Rafael Nadal took advantage of slightly cooler conditions to cruise into the Australian Open third round with a 6-2 6-4 6-2 win over 17-year-old Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis on Thursday.

After a third straight day of temperatures soaring over 40 degrees Celsius, the extreme heat policy was fully implemented for the first time, much to Nadalís delight. ìI was very happy to see the roof out there today,î Nadal told reporters. ìBut it was still very humid and still very hard conditions even with the roof on for that match.

Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal picked up two wickets in the last session to restrict Sri Lanka to 220 for five wickets at stumps on the first day of the third and final test in Sharjah on Thursday. The experienced slow bowler dismissed a well-set Mahela Jayawardene (47) with some extra spin and bounce and then baffled Dinesh Chandimal (11) with a doosra to reduce Sri Lanka to 166 for five at one stage. Captain Angelo Mathews (24) and wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene (28) held firm with an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 54 runs to deny Pakistan any further success. Ajmal was confident he had Prasanna out leg before and the umpire agreed too but the batsman reviewed the decision successfully as replays showed the ball was bouncing over the stumps. Faced with some accurate bowling from Pakistan, Sri Lanka found scoring difficult on a slow and low pitch at the Sharjah stadium after Mathews opted to bat after winning the toss. Mohammad Talha, playing only his second test, struck early to get rid of Kaushal Silva (17) while left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman dismissed Dimuth Karunaratne (34) immediately after lunch. Kumar Sangakkara (52) added 60 for the third wicket with Mahela to steady Sri Lankaís ship but hit paceman Junaid Khan tamely to mid-wicket after completing his 44th test fifty. Sangakkara, on 15, was lucky to survive an appeal for a catch after replays showed that he had gloved a sweep shot off Rehman. Pakistan opted not to challenge the umpireís not out verdict. Mahela looked in good control against the spinners before failing to negotiate a ball from Ajmal which turned and bounced sharply to take the edge and reach Azhar Ali at short leg.

Indiaís campaign in the womenís singles came to an end at the USD 500,000 Malaysia Super Series Premier badminton event after both Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu lost their respective second round matches in contrasting styles. While Olympic bronze medallist Saina fought hard before going down 21-16 10-21 19-21 to a lower-ranked Yao Xue of China in a 56-minute contest, Sindhu lost to sixth seed Yeon Ju Bae of Korea 16-21 19-21 in 45 minutes at the Putra Stadium. World No. 8 Saina, who had endured a tough season last year as she could not win a single title, failed to turn around her fortunes in her season opener. Saina lived up to her billing in the first game as she faced little trouble in overcoming World No. 25 Xue. Despite it being a close affair till 12-12, Saina kept her calm to seal the opening game 21-16. But the Indian was in for a rude shock in the second game as the Chinese girl maintained an upper-hand throughout. Saina, surprisingly, could not catch her opponent even once during game two. After taking the initial lead, Xue simply kept on moving ahead and opened up a massive gap. She eventually sealed the second game without breaking a sweat. In the decider, Saina got her act together and took a 7-4 lead before moving to 10-8. But Xue came back strongly to level the scores at 10-10 before slowly opening up a gap at 18-14. Saina, however, showed a lot of character as she fought back to pocket three successive points and reduce the margin to 17-18 before catching up with her rival at 19-19. But the Chinese raised her game when it mattered the most and bagged two quick points to stun her fancied Indian opponent. Meanwhile, World Championship bronze-medallist Sindhu got off to a fine start as she opened up a slight 2-0 lead and then extended it to 6-3 in the first game. But once the World No. 7 Korean settled down, she made it 6-6 before surging ahead to open up a gap of 10-6 by winning seven points on the trot. Not the one to give up so easily, Sindhu fought her way to reduce the margin to 9-10. But the higher ranked Korean kept on moving ahead and the closest that Sindhu could get to her once again was at 13-14. Thereafter, it was a smooth sail for Bae, who comfortably wrapped up the first game in her favour. The second game, however, was an interesting battle that saw the Korean post a come-from-behind victory. It was a neck-and-neck till 6-6 before Sindhu won three consecutive points to take a 9-6 lead. Determined not to let the advantage slip, the 18-year-old girl from Hyderabad kept on maintaining a slight edge till 16-15 before she bagged three more points on the trot to take a crucial 19-15 lead. But just when the World No. 11 Indian looked all set to seal the second game and take the match to the decider, Bae used all her experience to earn four straight points to make it 19-19.

The Munich state court said it decided to send the 83-year-old Ecclestone to trial following his indictment last May. He faces charges of bribery and incitement to breach of trust connected with a $45 million payment to a German banker, Gerhard Gribkowsky. Dates for the trial havenít yet been set but proceedings are currently expected to start at the end of April, a court statement said. Sentences in Germany for bribery range from three months to 10 years in prison. Ecclestoneís German lawyers, Sven Thomas and Norbert Scharf, said in a statement that ìthe alleged bribery did not happen.î ìThe accusations in the indictment based on Gribkowskyís statement are unfounded and do not Ö add up to a coherent picture,î they added. Gribkowsky was convicted in 2012 of taking the payment from Ecclestone in connection with the sale of a stake in F1. He was found guilty of corruption, tax evasion and breach of trust, and sentenced to 8 years in prison. Ecclestone has insisted that he did ìnothing illegal.î He acknowledged during Gribkowskyís trial that he made the payment but said he was pressured to do so. Gribkowsky was in charge of selling German bank BayernLBís 47 percent stake in F1 to investment group CVC Capital Partners in 2006. In addition to taking the money from Ecclestone, Gribkowsky used Bayern LBís funds to pay the F1 boss a commission of $41.4 million and agreed to pay a further $25 million to Bambino Trust, a company with which Ecclestone was affiliated, prosecutors†said during the Gribkowsky trial. In separate legal proceedings in London, German media company Constantin Medien ñ a former F1 shareholder ñ is suing Ecclestone and other defendants for up to $144 million, claiming F1 was undervalued by the Bayern LB deal. Ecclestone said in November at the High Court in London that he made a payment to avoid being reported by Gribkowsky to authorities over his tax affairs. ìI made up my mind he needed to be kept quiet,î Ecclestone said, asserting that he was ìshaken downî by Gribkowsky.",Formula One honcho Bernie Ecclestone faces bribery trial in Germany | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/motor-sport/formula-one-honcho-bernie-ecclestone-faces-bribery-trial-in-germany/

The document, acquired by Les Enluminures Gallery in New York, shows a carefully-drawn sketch of a kangaroo (know as a ìcanguruî in Portuguese) in its text and is dated between 1580 and 1620. It has led researchers to believe images of the marsupial were already being circulated by the time the Dutch ship Duyfken ñ long thought to have been the first European vessel to visit Australia ñ landed in 1606. The European discovery of Australia has been credited to the Dutch voyage headed by Willem Janszoon in 1606, but historians have suggested the country may already have been explored by other Western Europeans. Peter Trickett, historian and author of ëBeyond Capricorní, has long argued that a Portuguese maritime expedition first mapped the coasts of Australia in 1521-22, nearly a century before the Dutch landing. ìIt is not surprising at all that an image of a kangaroo would have turned up in Portugal at some point in the latter part of the 16th century, it could be that someone in the Portuguese expedition had this manuscript in their possession,î Trickett said. Les Enluminures Gallery acquired the pocket-sized manuscript from a rare book dealer in Portugal. ìA kangaroo or a wallaby in a manuscript dated this early is proof that the artist of this manuscript had either been in Australia or even more interestingly, that travellerís reports and drawings of the interesting animals found in this new world were already available in Portugal,î Les Enluminures researcher Laura Light said. ìPortugal was extremely secretive about her trade routes during this period, explaining why their presence there wasnít widely known,î she told the ëSydney Morning Heraldí. National Library of Australia curator of maps Martin Woods said while the image looked like a kangaroo or a wallaby, it alone was not proof enough to alter Australiaís history books. ìThe likeness of the animal to a kangaroo or wallaby is clear enough, but then it could be another animal in south-east Asia, like any number of deer species some of which stand on their hind legs to feed off high branches,î Woods said. The manuscript, known as a Processional, contains text and music for a liturgical procession and is inscribed with the name Caterina de Carvalho, believed to be a nun from Caldas da Rainha in western Portugal. Also nestled in letters of the text are two male figures adorned in tribal dress, baring naked torsos and crowns of leaves, which Light said could be depictions of Australian or south-east Asian natives.",400-year-old Kangaroo drawing may rewrite Oz history | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/400-year-old-kangaroo-drawing-may-rewrite-oz-history/

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has rallied to show support for the Philippines, especially its tourism recovery efforts, since typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) struck on November 8, 2013. After consultation with Philippines authorities, ASEAN says that the best way to help the Philippines is to continue with leisure, business and meetings travel to the Philippines as normal. The ASEAN secretary general Le Luong Minh, who visited damaged areas in the Philippines on November 22, 2013 to witness the distribution of ASEAN aid, said that while the country was still reeling from the impact of Haiyan, ìThe trademark Filipino hospitality can never be erased by any calamity.î Le Luong Minh said, ìThe vast majority of the country has been spared from the destruction. I would therefore like to urge you to visit the Philippines, enjoy yourselves, and show your support for the brave people who are rebuilding their lives. Now is the time to visit the Philippines and make your presence count.î The Philippines Department of Tourism (DOT) and its Tourism Promotion Board (TPB) have launched a series of tours called Bangon Tours where five per cent of net income from the trips will be allocated to NGOs supporting Haiyan relief and rebuilding efforts. The Bangon Tours slogan is, ìYour Vacation Means a Lotî. ìIt is an invitation to travel within the Philippines during the holiday period, visit our fun destinations and participate in rebuilding efforts,î a TPB statement said. The vast majority of tourism destinations have been unaffected by Haiyan, reported Ramon R Jimenez Jr, DOT secretary. He told the Manila Bulletin on December 15,2013 that ìthe affected areas did not happen to be touristic areas, except Coron. Destinations such as Puerto Princess (Palawan), Bohol and Manila were not meaningfully impacted. Nothing really happened to Manila so we are going to recover very rapidly, even from Yolanda ó from a touristic standpoint.

On Wednesday afternoon, a 15-year-old student brought a very large object covered in a blanket into Kubaís earth science class at Indian River High School in northern New York and said he wanted to show them a science experiment.

183,"Money 50: Best mutual funds and ETFs. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) Use these recommended mutual and exchange-traded funds to construct a portfolio thatís built to last. When Money magazine introduced the MONEY 70 list in 2007, the investing landscape sure was different. Exchange-traded funds were just coming onto the scene, and the merits of the strategy guiding them and index mutual funds were still the subject of great debate. Fast-forward to today. ETFs, which are baskets of securities that you can buy and sell throughout the day, are now part of the mainstream. And indexing has won the argument. Only one in four actively managed U.S. stock funds has beaten this approach over the past five years, raising doubts about whether you need to sift through scores of funds to create a diversified and effective portfolio. That is in part why we overhauled the list. Welcome to the new MONEY 50. In addition to being more concise, the list is organized differently. Rather than grouping funds based on the types of stocks or bonds they own, the new MONEY 50 categorizes funds based on how you might use them. For instance, do you plan to use them as building blocks for the core part of your portfolio? Or will you hold them in small doses, to customize your strategy? Despite those changes, the purpose of the list remains the same: to help you build a balanced portfolio that will get you to your most important financial goals, such as putting your kids through college or achieving a comfortable retirement. We reconfigured the list into three broad categories, based on how elaborate you want your portfolio to be. Building-block funds . This category, which contains 14 low-cost index funds and ETFs, is designed to help you assemble your core portfolio, which you're likely to hang on to for years and which represents the bulk of your assets. Why just index funds? Low-cost indexes offer the purest and cheapest exposure to broad swaths of the markets, which you'll want for your core. Studies show that most active managers fall short of their benchmarks because of the higher fees, trading costs, and timing errors associated with frequent trading. You should be able to construct a well-diversified portfolio with as few as three or four of the broad-market index funds found in the building-block section. Custom funds . Even a well-diversified core portfolio may not be enough to meet all of your needs. You may prefer to keep a small stake in actively managed funds, for instance, in hopes of earning a bit more return. Or perhaps you want to further diversify your portfolio by using alternative assets, such as real estate or commodities. This section includes 32 choices that allow you to craft a more specialized mix. If you are closing in on retirement and are seeking to boost income through dividend-paying stocks, you might choose SPDR S&P Dividend ETF . Younger, more aggressive investors might opt for a fund that holds bargain-priced small-cap stocks, such as Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF . Because of the added risks, limit your stake in these specialized funds. The bulk of your portfolio belongs in your core. One-decision funds . Prefer to leave the work to the pros? Then avoid the first two categories altogether and opt for the third: all-in-one funds, which include two target-date retirement series and two balanced funds. All these portfolios give you instant and sufficient diversification. But with target-date funds, the asset mix becomes more conservative as you approach retirement. Balanced funds, by contrast, maintain a constant allocation, typically around 60% to 65% stocks and 35% to 40% bonds. If you're unlikely or unwilling to monitor and tweak your portfolio over time, your best bet is a target-date fund that suits your age. Making of the MONEY 50.

187,"His real fear: a long bear market that would sabotage the early retirement that he and his wife, Suzanne, dream of. Robert, a pharmacist, hopes to work full-time for six more years, until he turns 60, then work part-time for another four years or so; Suzanne, a stay-at-home mom to the couple's four children for decades, wants to work at her new part-time job at a spa until Robert retires. ""We'd like to be able to visit family and do some traveling,"" says Suzanne, anticipating that the kids won't be living nearby. ""I'd like to go back to Europe."" Three of their children are still in college, but the Baumans have already covered most of their education. They expect to help their kids out a few more years with about $10,000 annually -- about 7% of their $140,000 income. Steve Pomeranz, a financial planner in Boca Raton, Fla., and host of the public radio show On the Money , thinks some changes are in order. For starters, Robert needs to be more hands-off with the couple's portfolio. ""He's chasing performance, and that will get him into big trouble,"" Pomeranz says. Robert has to back away from that all-stock allocation too. Last, he should keep working a little longer for the couple to have the retirement they want, Pomeranz says. THE ADVICE. Diversify investments. The Baumans' $1.2 million retirement portfolio is invested too heavily in stocks, says Pomeranz, and too heavily in certain types, such as a 60% large-cap stake. Pomeranz and his colleague Craig Jaffe suggest that the Baumans put 80% of their money in stock index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, mixing growth and value stocks; large-, mid-, and small-caps; and international stocks. The rest should go into bond ETFs and cash. Closer to retirement, the planners say, the Baumans should have a 60/40 ratio of stocks to bonds. The initial 80/20 mix is aggressive for people in their fifties, but not off the charts; T. Rowe Price's Retirement 2025 Fund, for people retiring in 11 years, has a 75/25 mix. Pomeranz says an 80% stock portfolio isn't right for everyone the Baumans' ages, but is appropriate for the couple, given the priority they place on retiring early, plus Robert's comfort with risk, as evidenced by his current all-stock portfolio. How to save for retirement in 2014. If the markets don't cooperate, says the planner, the couple would have to revise their plans by saving more, working longer, or living on less in retirement. Robert opts for a slightly safer 75/25 mix, which Pomeranz and Jaffe say should keep the couple on track. Boost savings. Robert puts 6% of his income in his 401(k); that and his company's match add up to $14,300 annually. In 2014 workers can put up to $17,500 of their own money in a 401(k), and Robert can add $5,500 more with the catch-up contribution permitted workers 50 and older. While the Baumans can't control the market's return, they can improve their odds of success by saving more. Pomeranz suggests raising Robert's total contribution to at least $20,000 a year. A much-needed car purchase gets in the way this year, but the Baumans hope to get started in 2015. Stay on the job. Even with extra savings, says Pomeranz, Robert needs to work full-time until he's at least 62, and then half-time for four years. The portfolio and Social Security should give the couple the inflation-adjusted equivalent of their current income. While conventional wisdom suggests retirees need only 70% to 80% of their pre-retirement income, Pomeranz's experience leads him to believe that the Baumans' spending is more likely to grow in early retirement than it is to shrink. ""People want to be active,"" he says. ""It's a whole new world out there."" The Baumans are not disappointed by the prospect of delaying retirement by a couple of years. ""That's still better than hearing that you can't retire until you're 70,"" Robert says. ""We'll see how it goes.""","Couple with $1.2 million betting too big on stocks - Jan. 8, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/08/retirement/investing-stocks.moneymag/index.html

Siev said the latest suit ìseeks to vacate an arbitration award that was recently rendered based on, among other things, the arbitratorís failure to render an arbitration award that derives its essence from the collectively bargained agreements between the parties, and his evident partiality, and also asserts that MLBPA breached its duty of fair representationî to Rodriguez. The earlier suit, Siev added, concerns conduct by MLB and Selig that ìoccurred outside the arbitration process and interferedî with Rodriguezís ìactual and prospective contracts/business relationships.î Daniel Engelstein, the MLBPAís lawyer, disagreed, saying in his filing that both cases are similar because they ìprincipally concern Mr. Rodriguezís allegations that MLB acted improperly in pursuing and imposing discipline against him, and issues concerning the suitability of the collectively bargaining grievance and arbitration procedures for resolving those allegations. ìThe parties could be subjected to conflicting orders to the extent factual findings are made in either case that pertain to the overlapping factual allegations or to the extent a judicial construction of the partiesí agreements is required in both cases,î he added. MLB lawyer Howard Gantz agreed, saying that even though different parties are listed as defendants in each suit ñ Selig was sued with MLB in the first filing while Rodriguez went after both the union and the league in the second ñìwe believe that the actions concern the same or substantially similar parties, property, transactions or events.î Rodriguez filed his first suit in October when he was in the middle of appealing a then-211-game suspension by MLB, which alleges Rodriguez used illegal performance-enhancing drugs multiple times and obstructed the leagueís doping investigation. Judge Lorna Schoefield was randomly assigned the first Rodriguez suit while Judge Edgardo Ramos was randomly picked to take the second. The filings of ìrelated case statementsî by all parties was requested by both judges in response to a new Manhattan federal court rule enacted this month to help ensure selection of judges on cases remains random and transparent. The new rule quietly came following recent public debate over how Judge Shira Scheindlin was tapped in 2008 to oversee a controversial lawsuit challenging the NYPDís stop-and-frisk tactics.","MLB, union move to merge A-Rodís two lawsuits into one | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/mlb-union-move-to-merge-a-rods-two-lawsuits-into-one/
189,"TAMPA ó Add Andruw Jones to the list of people who say any comparisons between Rangers ace Yu Darvish and coveted Japanese free agent Masahiro Tanaka are misguided. ìHe didnít strike a lot of people out like Darvish,î said Jones, the longtime Brave and former Yankees outfielder. ìHe pitched more to contact. He wanted to get guys to hit balls on the ground.î Jones came away impressed by Tanaka†after spending a season playing together for Rakuten in Japan. ìHe can overpower and he can control,î Jones said. ìHeís a very competitive guy.î The Yankees and Dodgers are largely considered to be the favorites to land Tanaka, who has until Jan. 24 to sign with a major league team. As many as a dozen teams are interested in Tanaka, who figures to get a contract worth at least $100 million over six years, as well as a posting fee of $20 million.†Jones sounded confident the 25-year-old would do well wherever he winds up. ìHis record speaks for itself,î said Jones, referring to Tanaka going 24-0 in 2013. ìAll heís done for Japan, I think itís enough. He was the best pitcher the last two years in Japan. Itís time for him to come to the States and show what heís got in the major leagues.î Jones, who is heading back to Rakuten for another season, wasnít able to compare Tanaka to anyone in the majors, but said he had spoken with Tanaka about the differences between the leagues. ìHe asked me a few questions about baseball over here,î said Jones, who was at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Wednesday at a fundraiser for Derek Jeterís Turn 2 Foundation. ìHeís got great talent. Baseball is baseball, anywhere you play it. Itís a higher level in Major League Baseball, but if youíre successful you can make the adjustment faster.î And Tanakaís famous splitter should help. ìHe has a very good split-finger,î Jones said.†ìAnd he started working on a changeup toward the end of the season. Heís a tremendous fielder. If he does all those things, heís got a good chance. The first year is gonna be a little different. The adjustment is up to him.î What kind of stats can we expect from Tanaka's rookie season? I assume the misleading headline was the Post's method of drawing in readers by suggesting there are negative opinions to be read on Tanaka. Not quite yellow journalism; more like yellow stream journalism. Misleading headline. †What Andruw appeared to say is that Tanaka is a different type of pitcher. †To imply he doesn't compare to Darvish leads one to think he's inferior to Darvish. †And that may not be true.",Andruw Jones: Tanaka doesnít compare to Darvish | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/andruw-jones-tanaka-doesnt-compare-to-darvish/
190,"MORE ON: For about a year, billionaire investor Phil Falcone was forced to play a guessing game with the media and investors. Who, exactly, was behind the massive purchases of debt in his troubled high-speed telecom startup, LightSquared? ìDepending on what day it was, I thought it was Cablevision, I thought it was Sprint, I thought it was AT&T ó I thought it was Carlos Slim,î Falcone told a Manhattan Bankruptcy Court judge on Thursday. Beginning in the spring of 2012 and lasting until May 2013, the question vexed the 51-year-old hedge-fund honcho. The answer became clear last spring. Charlie Ergen, the satellite mogul behind Dish Networks, was the buyer. Falcone and LightSquared claim Ergen bought the $800 million chunk of debt for his pay-TV company ó something not allowed under the terms of the bonds. The bankrupt telecom sued Ergen and Dish to unwind the sale. Ergen, in court papers and testimony earlier this week, claims he bought the debt as a personal investment and only got Dish involved a year later as an afterthought. The pay-TV provider made a $2.2 billion bid for LightSquaredís spectrum assets last summer before pulling the bid last week. The warring billionaires faced off in Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattan this week ó with their giant egos, their reputations and, possibly, billions of dollars on the line. Falcone, who owns the Harbinger Capital hedge-fund firm, has invested $3 billion of Harbinger cash in LightSquared, only to have it forced into bankruptcy when it couldnít gain regulatory approval to operate. Falcone, whose testimony was delayed 20 minutes because he was caught in traffic driving to the Bowling Green courthouse from his Upper East Side townhouse, is fighting to retain control of LightSquared. His testimony Thursday centered around the year-long guessing game of who was buying the debt. When Carl Icahn first sold his $250 million in LightSquared debt in 2012, Falcone seemed pretty certain that Ergen was the buyer. And he was OK with that. ìMaybe we should file (bankruptcy) if heís circling the wagons, though I think itís a positive,î Falcone wrote in an e-mail to another debt holder on May 5, 2012. ìMay bring in another strategic,î he said, referring to an investor to buy the company. But just a week later, Falcone was telling folks the buyer might be Cablevisionís Jimmy Dolan. ìHearing Cablevision,î he wrote to a pal on May 12. Days later, he told a Wall Street Journal reporter that Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim was teaming up with Ergen. ìCarlos Slim apparently involved with Ergen,î he wrote in mid-May. In May 2013, Falcone sent out an e-mail telling people, ìif I were a betting manî heíd wager that Slim was the buyer. Soon after, a lawyer for Ergen confirmed the purchases were made by the Dish founder. ìFortunately, Iím not a betting man,î Falcone responded. If Ergen is found to have violated the debt covenants with his purchases, he could be pushed to the back of the line when it comes to recoveries. Falconeís Harbinger has teamed up with private equity firm Fortress to take the company out of bankruptcy.",LightSquared Falconeís ëbearishí question: Whoís been sweeping in my debt? | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/lightsquared-falcones-bearish-question-whos-been-sweeping-in-my-debt/
191,"An obscure academic organization called the American Studies Association not long ago voted to endorse a resolution calling for a boycott of Israeli universities. The self-appointed moralists were purportedly outraged over the Israeli governmentís treatment of Palestinians. Given academiaís past obsessions with the Jewish state, the targeting of Israel is not new. Yet why do the professors focus on Israel and not Saudi Arabia, which denies women the right to drive and only recently granted them the right to vote? Why not Russia, which has been accused of suppressing free speech, or India, which has passed retrograde anti-homosexual legislation? The hip poet Amiri Baraka (aka Everett LeRoi Jones) recently died. He was once poet laureate of New Jersey, held prestigious university posts and was canonized with awards ó despite being a hateful anti-Semite. After 9/11, Baraka wrote a poem that suggested Israel knew about the plan to attack the World Trade Center. One of his poems from the í60s included this unabashedly anti-Semitic passage: ìSmile, jew. Dance, jew. Tell me you love me, jew .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. I got the extermination blues, jewboys. I got the hitler syndrome figured.î Yet that did not preclude The New York Times and NPR from praising him after his death. US Secretary of State John Kerry Photo: Getty Images. Trendy multicultural French comedian DieudonnÈ Míbala Míbala is known for his anti-Semitic provocations and for making a gesture that has been described as an inverted Nazi salute. He recently quipped of a Jewish journalist: ìWhen I hear him talk, you see .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. I say to myself, gas chambers .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. a pity.î Auschwitz is now a joke? In politics, Israel often finds itself at the wrong end of a troubling double standard. Secretary of State John Kerry seems to be camped out in Israel these days. The Obama administration hopes to pressure Israeli leaders to offer concessions that will lead to an elusive Middle East peace. Yet even if Israel gave this administration what it wanted, how would America guarantee reciprocal commitments from the notoriously corrupt Palestinian Authority, which has no democratic legitimacy? Terrorist-affiliated Hamas wants no part of any such settlement. Itís hardly anti-Semitic to focus on IsraeliPalestinian problems, or even to pressure the Israelis. But it becomes so when problems elsewhere are simply ignored, and Israel alone is singled out to be chastised. Is the United Nation focused on the 13 million Germans who were ethnically cleansed from Eastern Europe about the same time that thousands of Palestinians left what became Israel? Would the American Studies Association boycott Chinese universities over the absorption of Tibet? Is the world really troubled about divided capitals like Jerusalem? If so, why not an international conference on the Turkish occupation of a divided Nicosia? Nazis and racists used to spearhead Jewish hatred, based on ancient crackpot defamations that date back to the Jewish diaspora into Europe after the Roman destruction of Judaea. But lately, anti-Semitism has become more a left-wing pathology. It is driven by the cheap multicultural trashing of the West. Jewish people here and abroad have become convenient targets for those angry with supposedly undeserved Western success and privilege. Aside from the old envy, and racial and religious hatred, I think cowardice explains the new selective anti-Semitism. The American Studies Association would not call for a boycott of Russia despite its endemic persecution of gays. After all, Russian President Vladimir Putin is as unpredictable as Israeli politicians are forbearing. Kerry is not rushing into Damascus to stop the bloodletting that has claimed far more lives than all the Palestinians lost in 70 years of conflict with Israel. Syrian President Bashar Assad, Shiite terrorists and al Qaeda would not listen politely to Kerryís pontificating sermons. The sort of anti-Semitism we see from the buffoonish like DieudonnÈ Míbala Míbala is appalling, but the double standard to which Israel is held in matters of foreign policy by those who should know better is in many ways even more galling.",The cowardly new anti-semitism | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/the-cowardly-new-anti-semitism/
192,"There is untapped potential to increase access to pre-kindergarten in high-need communities through public charter schools, which serve many high-need students. The words come courtesy of Gov. Cuomoís Education Reform Commission, and they speak the obvious: The stateís charter schools are a natural vehicle for good pre-K programs. Then again, when it comes to public education in New York these days, speaking up for the obvious can be an invaluable public service. Thatís especially true because Mayor de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Carmen FariÒa are making it clear they regard charters as the ugly stepchild of the family. The commissionís modest statement reminds us not only that charters are full-fledged public schools, but that the children who attend them are public-school students. We frankly remain skeptical of the efficacy of pre-K programs, especially if the mayor and the chancellor succeed in confining the program to schools where teachers unions dominate. But we suspect that if anyone can make pre-K work, it will be the charters ó for the same reason they have shown they can teach children whom others write off as uneducable. Apparently thatís not the way FariÒa sees it. This week she made clear to National Public Radio she regards herself as chancellor only for public-school children in teachers-union schools. ìI think right now we need space for our own kids,î she said. ìYouíre going to have a large pre-K initiative. Where are we going to put some of those kids?î For a New York City schools chancellor to suggest charter-school students arenít ìour kidsî is disgraceful. Whose kids are they, Madame Chancellor?",Charter schools should be part of universal pre-K | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/charter-schools-should-be-part-of-universal-pre-k/
193,"If ever we see the happy day when legislatures move to forbid public dollars for TV ads that benefit politicians in office, weíll be leading the parade. But if Chris Christie is now to be politically hanged for his familyís eight-second appearance in a spot touting the Jersey Shore, we say: Investigate all governors. For thereís little material difference between the $25 million New Jersey campaign that helped promote Christie and the $140 million ìNew York State Open for Businessî campaign ó which also used federal funding drawn from Sandy aid ó to tout successes that promote Gov. Cuomo, even though he didnít appear in them. But news the feds are investigating Christie for his ads generates big headlines because it comes as Jerseyís governor is handling fallout from revelations that, contrary to what he told us earlier, his staff did close down lanes on the George Washington Bridge for crass political payback. When the papers published the damning e-mail from his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, to one of his appointees at the Port Authority, David Wildstein, Christie admitted heíd been proven wrong. He fired Kelly for having lied to him and sacked his two-time campaign adviser, Bill Stepien, who knew what happened and hadnít stepped up. Two appointees at the Port Authority had already resigned and face their own problems. In the week since, weíve seen no evidence to contradict Christieís account of what he knew about the lane closures and when. So by all means, let Christie answer for the breach of trust committed by people he appointed. But the 24/7 ìChristie scandalî coverage we now see suggests that whatís really driving some of these headlines isnít about TV ads or what happened on the George Washington Bridge last September. Itís about ensuring that a leading Republican contender for president wonít be on the ballot come November 2016.",The mediaís Christie craze  | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/the-medias-christie-craze/

But letís be real ó itís all about the clothes. To honor the honors, weíve bestowed our own set of awards: the yearís best sartorial accomplishments. Whether for a particular fashion moment or for overall exceptional style, these categories praise the best of the dressed. No need for multiple contenders ó most were clear champs, and a majority were even nominated for the real deal. Watch for these stars to wow this red carpet season, beginning with Sundayís 71st Golden Globe Awards (8 p.m. ET on NBC). Best Dressed Motion Picture Actress. Cate Blanchett Photo: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for DIFF. And the winner is: Cate Blanchett. Thereís no outperforming Cate Blanchett. Sure, the actress soared as a fallen socialite in Woody Allenís ìBlue Jasmine,î but she also did the fashion set a big solid by setting the sartorial bar on the red carpet. With her Old Hollywood beauty and elegance, it would be easy for Blanchett to get by in pretty, safe-bet gowns; instead, the Aussie often plays against type with a taste for forward-thinking designs from labels like Christopher Kane and Valentino. Cate the Great ruled in a regal caped number by the latter just last month at the Dubai International Film Festivalís opening gala. Best Dressed Actress in a TV Series. Kerry Washington Photo: Jason Merritt/Getty Images. And the winner is: Kerry Washington. On ìScandal,î Kerry Washington plays a powerful political publicist and the best-dressed working woman on TV. Her real-life fashion chops are even more impressive, with a penchant for florals a la Marchesa and Giambattista Valli, whose strapless cocktail dress she wore at a Beverly Hills BAFTA event back in September. Just chalk it up to Washingtonís style astuteness ó she simply knows what works for her. And yes, from feminine blossoms to razor-chic structured pieces, thatís practically everything. Hail Kerry. Best Comedic Chic. Julia Louis-Dreyfus Photo: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic. And the winner is: Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In case you hadnít noticed, Elaine Benes has never looked better. Louis-Dreyfus, who keeps it skirt-suit-conservative on ìVeep,î vamps it up off-screen in Dolce & Gabanna, Emilio Pucci and other designers partial to form-fitting shapes and slits. Combining tasteful sex appeal and signature humor is a hard-to-beat combo. Case in point: the Monique Lhuillier gown the comedienne wore to the Emmys in September. If you thought style was exclusive to serious acting stars, the joke is on you. Best Foreign Language Style Star. Lea Seydoux Photo: Audrey Poree/Abaca/startraksphoto.com. And the winner is: LÈa Seydoux. Funny the controversy surrounding ìBlue is the Warmest Colorî concerns the absence of clothes, since its star, LÈa Seydoux, is making a splash on the international fashion scene with her effortless je ne sais quoi style (damn those French!). A connoisseur of Prada, Isabel Marant and Elie Saab, Seydoux is also the face of Miu Miu alongside ìBlueî co-star AdËle Exarchopoulos, and graced the cover of W magazine in October. Just two weeks ago, mademoiselle proved blue is certainly the chicest color at a premier in Paris ó in head-to-toe Louis Vuitton, bien s˚r. Best Dramatic Ensemble. Jennifer Lawrence Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP. And the winner is: Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence deserves this accolade on two fronts: one for chopping her long locks into a pixie cut, another for the voluminous Dior gown she flaunted at the ìHunger Games: Catching Fireî premiere in Los Angeles in November. It was long, sweeping, and .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. completely sheer. Luckily, transparent works when the body revealed is as ó if not more ó attractive as the garments themselves. Best Animated Outfit. Lupita Nyongío Photo: Phil McCarten/UPI. And the winner is: Lupita Nyongío. She may have appeared from nowhere, but take one look at Lupita Nyongío and itís clear the ì12 Years a Slaveî actress is no style novice. The Yale-grad with acting cred aced every red carpet appearance to become the award seasonís breakout star. One of her best fashion feats came in October by way of Miu Miu at a Directors Guild screening in West Hollywood. The fancifully printed, pale-pink dress, awash in swirls of color, was the perfect choice for Nyongío, who brought the quirky runway look to life with natural grace and effervescence. Best Mini (Dress!) Rooney Mara Photo: Stefania D'Alessandro/WireImage. And the winner is: Rooney Mara. ìMiniî typically implies skimpy, but for high-concept designer darlings like Rooney Mara, itís simply a jumping off point for something more poignant. In November, the ìHerî actress wowed at the Rome International Film Festival in an ethereal Balenciaga dress ó short and strapless ó encased in a sheer overlay that was part bride, part beetle. The effect was simultaneously nostalgic and futuristic; the moment, another red-carpet triumph for the girl with the dragon tattoo. Best Supporting Accessory. Scarlett Johansson Photo: Elisabetta A. Villa/WireImage. And the winner is: Scarlett Johansson. Since Scarlett Johanssonís best accessory is arguably her bosom, the actressí choice of adornment at the Venice Film Festival in September delivered quite the double whammy. Fashion critics swooned over the actressí Bulgari necklace, which sparkled in an ombre of pink, blue and green stones and popped in brilliant contrast to her black Versace gown. With such va-va-voom, itís almost a shame her role in ìHerî was limited to just her voice. Best Original Style. Naomie Harris Photo: Marion Curtis/StarPix. And the winner is: Naomie Harris. Naomie Harris is ìItî girl of the cinema circuit, and is steadily dominating the fashion one, too. But what separates her from other ìItî girls is her talent. Beyond acting chops, the ìMandela: Long Walk to Freedomî actress boasts a refreshing beauty; she doesnít shock or reinvent the wheel with her outfit choices, but rather works clothes in a way that are true to her personal style and spirit ó sophisticated, adventurous, fun. The Valentino dress she wore to a New York premiere in November is a prime example. Best Screen Print. Michelle Dockery Photo: Patrick McMullan/ PatrickMcMullan.com. And the winner is: Michelle Dockery. Will ìDownton Abbeyî ever see the digital age? In fact, it already has. Back in September, Michelle Dockery debuted a digital print Mary Katrantzou dress to a Vanity Fair fete in New York, sporting the bucolic landscapes with which her characterís so familiar on her back. The trend doesnít always go over so well, but true to form, the ever-so-refined Lady Mary pulled it off with great aplomb, and we havenít seen it done better since.

Needless to say, it was a bigger disaster than ì The Canyons .î WWD called the collection ó neon leggings, nipple pasties, et al. ó ìan embarrassment,î online commenters called it much worse, and just a year later the relationship went kaput. Although the whole situation spoke for itself, Lohan was unable to discuss the details of why she left the label. Legal issues, of course. Kanye West for A.P.C. Kanye West has fared much worse in other fashion ventures than in his capsule with impossibly cool French label A.P.C., which hit stores and online last July (and sold out soon after). Yeah, $120 for glorified Hanes is steep, but a relative steal considering Saint Laurentís price tags . The real crime is that people willingly spent good money on basics that bore no trace of the rapper beyond his name on a thin red label, a ploy boasting Minajesty, the new fragrance by Nicki Minaj, as its nearest relative. Do fleece plain hoodies, jeans, and T-shirts really need Westís seal of approval to sell? If so, the problem is well beyond him. Miley Cyrus and Max Azria. Photo: Walmart/AP. Remember 2009 Miley?

For years, the myth surrounding Carrie Bradshaw has led some to labor under the delusion that Sarah Jessica Parker is the queen of all things fashion. Those people clearly donít recall ìBitten,î the line of budget clothing SJP fronted from 2007 until 2009, when its exclusive retailer, Steve & Barryís, went bankrupt.

Anyhow, the Kollection, sold at Sears since 2011, features everything youíd imagine middle-sis Kim would doodle on a sketchpad if you could imagine her doing anything beyond getting her nails done. But donít think it stops at keyhole dresses and nude pleather pumps. Oh no. The Kardashians extend their love of leopard and gold to handbags, sunglasses, bath towels and even bedding (insert sex-tape joke). ìMaterial Girlî by Madonna. Because there just werenít enough thrift shop options for fans of ìThe Carrie Diaries,î in 2010, Madonna teamed up with daughter Lourdes for a juniors line inspired by the punk style she flaunted while rising to fame in the í80s. Itís a shame the ìmaterialsî are cheap and ó as customers have complained ó the sizing too small for the latter half of its intended 13 to 25 demographic. Overall, if the clothes had half the stylistic spark Madge worked in her heyday, weíd shut up. But sadly, the offerings leave everything to be desired. Mother-daughter projects are generally adorable, but this one is borderline ugly. ìDollhouseî by Paris Hilton. Photo: Getty. Paris loves fashion. Paris loves Paris. So no one was surprised when, in 2008, the reality star delivered ìDollhouse,î a lineup of skinny jeans, sequin tanks, track suits and tees printed with Warhol-esque versions of Hiltonís face.

We all know the name, but despite the Beyonceís staggering universal popularity, no one can tell you much about the ìHouse of DerÈon,î her and mom Tinaís faux-dynastic fashion line, created in 2006. In fact, most of us consider the line an extension of her alter ego (Sasha Fierce loooves her DerÈon jeans!), since not even BeyoncÈ herself wears it.

But the great Achatz seems stymied over how to deal with the dilemma, musing to his Twitter followers: Dude, let me tell you what you surely know: Babies have no place in a dining room where customers come to experience molecular-based meals that start at $210 a head. It isnít the kidsí fault for indulging in traditional baby behavior such as screaming and spitting, itís the fault of parents who regard their offspring as exempt from normal expectations of social decorum. But ìdecorumî is mere nostalgia at restaurants today. Many are so loud, a chorus of colicky whiners barely registers against the din of birthday booze fests. Iím tempted to break out a ball gag at meals ruined by tantrum-throwing tots. Iím still getting over the little monster at now-closed Grayz who jumped up and down like a chimpanzee on the banquette all night. The topic is a hot potato for many chefs. A rep for Eleven Madison Park ó the celebrated New York restaurant that once swapped its menu and kitchen staff with Alineaís ó says chef Daniel Humm is ìinsanely focusedî on a new menu and not available for comment.

The suggestion is always made ìby a suit, not the waiter,î he says. ìIf thereís a bad guy, it should be a manager.î Ed Brown, chef at Edís Chowder House, says Achatz might have offered the family a car ride home, food to take with them, and an invitation to return another night. ìAt a restaurant at that level, at the prices it charges, you canít have a baby wail away in the dining room,î Brown says. Damn right. Of course, while chefs and owners grapple with half-measures, parents of noisy kids can save us all a lot of trouble. Order in and eat at home, where only you and the delivery guy can hear your children scream. Has your dinner ever been disrupted by a crying baby? ""If you have money for fine dining then you have money for a sitter"" replies everyone else. ""but baby needs to be breastfed""† says the momma. ""put it in a bottle""† replies everyone else. ""my baby doesn't take a bottle we don't believe in bottles""† says the mama. ""then don't go to a fine dining restaurant""† replies everyone else. ""I call discrimination!!† We should be allowed to go anywhere we want! ""says the mama. ""Fine dining is NOT a place to take your infant.† People paid lots of $$ for their meals - either get a babysitter or do Not come to this restaurant.† Babies and toddlers are NOT wanted""† says everyone else. ""pfft""† says the mama. (sorry Had to post this silly scenario - I get sick of entitled parents and their thought they can bring their infants everywhere) Leave the damn baby at home. †Selfish parents believe that their child will be damaged if they're not with them 24/7/365 never taking into account that the rest of the world doesn't want to hear your sprog scream the song of its people over a meal or a movie or whatever. † And STFU about the baby having a ""disability."" †All the more reason to leave it at home or just stay the F home. Grow up. †It's not cute. It's not funny. † Your child is not expressing himself. †Your child is an ass and you as the parents need to get on the Failboat as it takes a ride in the woods. to xsx.† You ""have been taking your baby to fine restaurants since she was 9 months old?† The secret -- we show her how to behave well?""††Please stop. † How do you show a 9-month-old child how to behave.† You, like most people, live in a dream world. when it became illegal to smoke indoors, instead of smoking or nonsmoking section, they should have kids, nonkids sections so all the kids can be in one dining room and not bother people that dont have/didnt bring their kids. We take my 4 yo daughter to the best restaurants in Manhattan and have been doing so since she was 9 months.† I am always amused by the worried looks of the patrons on our entrance, because by the end of the meal the manager will always come out and congratulate us on the best behaved child in the city.† Our secret - we actually took the time to show her how to behave well. Initially, it was difficult and essentially involved me and my wife not eating while correcting our child's behavior for the ENTIRE meal with hardly a break. Now it's a pleasure for both of us as well as our child. She does not run around or scream at all. She enjoys the meals and constantly asks us if we can ""go out"". Taking an infant or toddler to such high end restaurants such as these is unacceptable. In my opinion, it is a display of arrogance and lack of class by the parents to subject other patrons to the potential for a bawling child. If reservations are made so far in advance, there should be no problem to find a good babysitter. Furthermore, older children who are running around, loud, whiny, and in general misbehaved should also be kept out of the restaurant. Aside from an innocent infant bawling, what is more egregious to me is a 5 year old running around the restaurant, screaming, whining, etc... The absence of discipline by these parents is astounding! There are several facts missing from this article that are necessary to review this story: (1) Reservations at Alinea are made 6 months to 1 year in advance. You pay for your dinner up front, 6 months to 1 year in advance. (2) The tickets purchased by this couple were $1,200.00 for two (pricey). (3) Dinner is approximately 4 hours in length. I don't know whether the couple intended to go out to eat with their child, or whether a baby sitter called out at the last minute. If I had been the host, I would have offered to provide them with a reservation on another night, or refunded their money. Alinea is the only party that should be held responsible for the ambiance/atmosphere of their restaurant. It shows poor management on their part that they risked the experience of the other diners by not having a strategy in place to deal with this situation. Going to Alinea is not ""going out to dinner"" you are not ""eating a meal"" it is more akin to going to a Broadway show, it's a performance. I find it amazing that this even needs to be said. What would incline a couple to bring a child, let a lone a baby, to a fine dinning restaurant. The only acceptable answers are arrogance or stupidity. I find few things as distressing as a crying baby in an upscale restaurant. I do not expect to be serenaded by a distressed infant when attempting to enjoy a meal with my husband and friends and I highly resent it on the rare occasions when it does happen. I can not believe the total lack of consideration shown by those who drag their babies along to dinner. Not only are those poor babies usually exhausted and up far beyond their bedtimes but many of their fellow diners have paid baby sitters to have a child free,†adult meal. Restaurants need to put the†comfort of the many diners ahead of the†few with no respect for others. @ xdx Thank you for taking the time to show your young child how to behave well. I bet you also help your child with homework and believe in personal responsibility, traits that seem to be gone with the wind. Unfortunately, too many parents feel entitled and just don't care about inconveniencing others as I suspect they too were spoiled brats who have never grown up.",Enjoy fine dining?

199,"China Mobile to kick off iPhone bonanza. China Mobile will start selling iPhones on Friday after years of feverish anticipation, and Apple CEO Tim Cook is getting the party started with a visit to Beijing. Partnering with China Mobile ( CHL ) gives Apple a needed boost in China, where it has has been losing the smartphone race to competitors offering cheaper options. The deal expands Apple's footprint in the world's most populous country, boosting its potential customer base by 700 million -- more than twice the population of the U.S. ""China is a very, very important geography for Apple, not only for its size, but for many other reasons as well,"" Cook told reporters Wednesday in Beijing. Cook was also effusive in his praise for China Mobile and its chairman Xi Guohua. ""We saw a company in China Mobile that was unlike any other company we had ever dealt with, that had enormous skill and enormous size and enormous scale and enormous talent,"" Cook said, according to a transcript published by the Wall Street Journal . The two companies said they have already received more than 1 million pre-orders for the iPhone. On Apple's China website, a 16 GB iPhone 5s is priced at 5,288 yuan ($874) and a 16 GB iPhone 5c costs 4,488 yuan ($742). The price tag should be lower for China Mobile subscribers, depending on the subsidies offered by the carrier. Analysts have estimated Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) could sell as many as 24 million iPhones this year through China Mobile, although others think the number will be closer to 10 million. Will the iPhone succeed in China? Until now, Apple has only been able to offer the iPhone through China Mobile's smaller competitors, China Unicom ( CHU ) and China Telecom ( CHA ) , which have about 425 million subscribers combined. Having access to China Mobile's large subscriber base is expected to be lucrative for Apple, but the company still has a long way to go in China. The iPhone remains costly compared to smartphones produced by rival firms like Xiaomi . Apple also lacks the app store advantage in China that it has in most other countries, as the government censors many offerings on Apple's iTunes App Store , and Chinese customers haven't proven willing to spend money on top-tier apps when they can get free knockoffs.","China Mobile to kick off Apple iPhone bonanza - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/technology/apple-china-mobile/index.html
200,"""We expect to recover the cost of investment in a year's time,"" said Singh who was purchasing over 10,000-12,000 litre of diesel annually. ""Solar powered irrigation system is a strong answer to prevailing energy insecurity and erratic power supply in the farm sector that needs to improve its productivity to beat the inflation ,"" said Shashwat Green Fuels & Technologies business development head Karan Dangayach. Primarily manufacturing solar water pumps, Dangayach said that these pumps have a life of 25 years and are also useful for drip irrigation. Blessed with solar power in abundance, rural India is now progressively utilising it for irrigation. If manufacturing companies are to be believed, threshing, fodder cutting, tractor, desalination and water purification, all this would soon run on solar power. Apart from solar equipment makers, rising diesel cost and awareness for solar power has compelled agri-input manufacturers to include solar in their portfolio. In the past 20 months, diesel prices have shot up by 20% to the current Rs 53.78 a litre (in New Delhi). ""Solar-based products have a huge market in the remote areas, where they can easily replace costly diesel and kerosene. Apart from irrigation, solar can also help in powering the villages,"" said Parag Shah, managing partner of Mahindra Partners and head of Mahindra Cleantech division. Mahindra group recently announced its entry in the solar equipment business with a new division 'Ekosol' with its core market being rural India. The company offers a range of solar products, such as solar lantern, solar water pumping systems, home back up and lightning systems. SunEdison, a New York Stock Exchange listed manufacturer and supplier of solar technology and energy services, announced customised solar water pumps for Indian rural market. Designed by R&D teams in California, USA and Bangalore, this solar-powered pump offers solution for farmers who need year-round cultivation and predictable daytime irrigation. In a one of its kind product in Gujarat state, Mumbai-based Waaree Group has come up with a solar powered cold storage for potato near Vadodara district. ""We have the demand with increasing knowledge and interaction amongst farmers. We will keep launching new products and expect sales to increase,"" said Hitesh Doshi CMD, Waaree Group. Sale of solar agriculture products accounted to 16% of the Rs 300-crore turnover for Waaree, which Doshi said they intend to increase to over 20% with atargeted turnover of Rs 750 crore in the next fiscal. ""We are working on solar run products for farmers. Within a few months, we will be launching the products in the domestic market,"" said Lachhman Das Mittal, chairman of Hoshiarpur-headquartered Sonalika Group. The company, which sells 'Sonalika' brand tractors, is one of five largest tractor manufacturers in the country. In its one year of its operation, Bangalore-based Siddon Biotech has been able to sell 50 odd machines costing Rs 70,000 a piece. Sold through 14 milk cooperatives in Karnataka, farmers earned a subsidy in the range of Rs 5,000-6,000 per piece. ""We are targeting progressive farmers who can make an initial investment and are aware of its long term benefits,"" said Siddaramanna, owner, Siddon Biotech. The company is also working on solar chaff cutter to cut fodder and solar power hydroponics system to grow fodder and vegetables in water. Delhi-based Jakson Power Solutions manufactures mobile solar generator that is easy to carry and can be used to power homes to farms and even run water pumps. This mobile solar generator runs not only on solar modules but also on battery, grid power and even diesel gen sets. Arough industry estimate said that over 60 lakh water pumps -submersible and others run on diesel and electricity whereas only 3,000 pumps on solar system. According to one of the green solution providers for agriculture sector, Central government has announced subsidies for solar technology but is not disbursing funds. ""Also, state sponsored schemes are centred around the module manufacturers and it limits the solution providers from marketing their products efficiently,"" he said requesting anonymity. Adding to this, Doshi said that state governments should subsidise solar powered equipments rather than giving free electricity to farmers.

201,"NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated first list of Aam Aadmi Party candidates for the Lok Sabha elections will be high on impact but low on numbers. According to senior leaders, AAP will announce not more than 20 candidates next week, but the list, which is expected on January 20, will boast names of strong contestants. Former banker Meera Sanyal, besides senior AAP leaders Mayank Gandhi , Ilyas Azmi and Kumar Vishwas are among the probable names for the first list, said people aware of the selection process. Sanyal, former chairperson of the Royal Bank of Scotland in India, had contested and lost as an Independent in the 2009 general elections from South Mumbai. Azmi, a two-time MP from UP and former member of the BSP , is also a strong contender because of his experience. Although Gandhi and Vishwas are political novices, the party is confident of their candidature and the latter has already started his campaign in Rahul Gandhi's constituency Amethi. ""It will be a short list of about 15 to 20 names only, but these are people who will make strong candidates,"" senior AAP leader Prashant Bhushan told ET, refusing to divulge the names of prospective contestants. On being asked if any of the members of party's political advisory committee would figure on the list, Bhushan did not rule out the possibility. The party has received an overwhelming response to its call for applications for Lok Sabha seats. The deadline expired on Wednesday. According to Pankaj Gupta, party leader in charge of screening applications, AAP received close to 1,100 entries until Wednesday, of which 300 had fulfilled the condition of getting their candidature endorsed by at least 100 people from one constituency. AAP will kickstart its national campaign with the declaration of its first list and the party is gearing up to take on the BJP directly, said party leader Sanjay Singh . National convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has already indicated that the national elections will be a direct contest between AAP and BJP as Congress has fallen off the grid, according to it. ""The candidates whose names will be announced in the first round will begin their campaign immediately... The BJP is trying to project itself as an alternative to the Congress and we have all the intention to expose that,"" said Bhushan, adding the party will launch a no-holds-barred attack on Narendra Modi. Although the names of former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan, late PM Lal Bhahadur Shashtri's grandson Adarsh Shashtri , and AAP national executive member Anand Kumar are also among the list of probable candidates, sources said they could figure in the subsequent lists and not the first.","AAP's first Lok Sabha list to be short, but high-impact; Meera Sanyal, Mayank Gandhi & Ilyas Azmi among probables - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/and/nation/AAPs-first-Lok-Sabha-list-to-be-short-but-high-impact-Meera-Sanyal-Mayank-Gandhi--Ilyas-Azmi-among-probables/articleshow/28863978.cms

Water shortages in Gurgaon; a restless slum and migrant population in Mumbai; disenchantment with the existing parties in Bangalore ...a quick dekko at the issues citizens in these metros are grappling with will inevitably have you concluding: Hey, aren't these the same problems that plague Delhi ó and facilitated the emergence of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the recent assembly elections and it eventually forming the government? That question can lead to another tempting conclusion: if AAP could take Delhi by storm, surely it can replicate its success in other metros ó and indeed all over a country in which corruption and a lack of transparency in governance are a universal bugbear. It isn't, of course, that straightforward. But if an emboldened AAP has embarked on an all-India recruitment drive with the aim of garnering 1 crore members by January 26, it's because the party's leader Arvind Kejriwal and his core team have sensed an opportunity to go in for the big kill ó the general elections that are around the corner. True, time is short, the national waters are untested and AAP has its task cut out to find credible names to take on the big parties. But the iron is hot, and AAP is ready to strike. Here's how. First stop Gurgaon:","AAPís national voyage: Can it replicate Delhiís success in metros like Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bangalore? - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/aaps-national-voyage-can-it-replicate-delhis-success-in-metros-like-gurgaon-mumbai-bangalore/articleshow/28691255.cms
203,"All of last year, political discourse centred around Narendra Modi versus Rahul Gandhi . By the turn of the year, after AAP's victory in Delhi, the poser had become different: Would Arvind Kejriwal be able to checkmate Modi in 2014? Today even that question has been overtaken. Could AAP, given the upsurge for it, become the fulcrum around which the next government is formed? Two months ago such a formulation would have sounded ridiculous and politically naive. But such is the rapidity with which events are moving, that what seemed impossible yesterday is becoming possible today. The new party's success in Delhi, its decision to form government, the speed with which it moved to fulfil its 'bijlee-paani', 'helpline' promises, even as experts quibbled about their pros and cons, has aroused a billion hopes. A growing urban middle class that had made good during the last two decades since the onset of the liberalisation era, wants now to be a participant in the change they suddenly believe can be possible. Thousands are thronging AAP's offices to enrol as members, in metros, even in states like UP and Bihar, where the party units have even run out of forms, and receipt books. AAP is already eyeing a state like Haryana, where it will contest all the 90 assembly seats in the state polls are slated year end. The Gujarat unit of AAP is insisting on fighting all 26 Lok Sabha seats and bearding the lion in his den. UP and Bihar have held the key to Modi's success, as do the urban seats, where many had begun to see the Gujarat strongman as ""the"" alternative. Many of the floating voters are now looking at AAP as an option. A breakthrough in a state like UP, still not out of the Mandal-Kamandal woods, is no easy task, and the BJP has been gaining ground after Muzaffarnagar. And yet, there is an enthusiastic response to AAP in the cities, and I was stunned to learn from a Congress worker in Amethi that there was a ""craze"" building up for AAP among the young! AAP's strategy in UP appears to be to alter the direction of the wind by challenging the big daddies of Indian politics ó Rahul in Amethi, Rajnath Singh in Ghaziabad, Murli Manohar Joshi in Varanasi, or Modi, if he decides to stand from there. A worried BJP ó it too is trying to innovate, and its ""one vote, one note"" way of collecting funds is one such attempt ó is already trying to project AAP as a ""vote cutter"", which will only ensure ""political instability"" at the Centre. AAP knows that itwill have to come across as a real challenger to the UPA, and not just as a spoiler. It has to go big or it will get sucked in a myriad systemic problems. Three months is long enough to strike big, and not long enough for the Teflon effect to wear off. It is not surprising that the. one-year-old party is planning to contest around 300 Lok Sabha seats and is making a pitch for no less than Raisina Hill. It was not for nothing that AAP's Yogendra Yadav floated Kejriwal's name as the party's PM candidate. ThoughKejriwal ruled this out ó so had VP Singh in 1987-89, but such was the ground level pressure, that he had to be anointed ó the ""Kejriwal as PM"" signal has gone, and the media is running with three prime ministerial candidates for 2014. Obviously, it is Kejriwal's performance in Delhi which could create a multiplier effect. AAP leaders will have to move wisely and desist from airing their ""personal"" views, as Prashant Bhushan did on Kashmir. Undoubtedly, AAP will have to finalise its manifesto quickly to bring about a programmatic coherence in the party. AAP is positioning itself as a non-Congress, non-BJP, secular, left of centre entity, with views on the economy which may not be ""radical"", but which are veering towards the ""middle path"" the Congress did not walk, though its leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , paid lip service to the idea. It is trying to be an umbrella like the Congress of yesteryears, reaching out to the deprived, Dalits, minorities, but with an appeal to the urban middle class and the youth ó there are 10 crore new voters ó so far considered BJP's catchment area. Since it was widely held that Modi would be a player only if he managed to notch up 200 Lok Sabha seats. If AAP manages to win 30-40 seats, or if the AAP effect cuts into the BJP vote and enables ""others"" to win constituencies, which would have otherwise gone the Modi way, the 16th Lok Sabha could present a picture different from the one that BJP had envisaged. Because AAP is riding atop the crest of a popular upsurge, it has the potential to be the speedbreaker in Modi's ride to poweró and be more than that. Organisation, money, ideology are important for a party to fare well.

But it's U.S. car buyers who might come out ahead. VW says it wants to be No. 1 globally by 2018. To do that it will have to drastically improve its sales in the U.S., where it badly trails GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Ford and Toyota Motor ( TM ) . VW is currently the No. 8 auto manufacturer in the U.S., and the only one to report a drop in sales in a rebounding U.S. market. This week at the Detroit auto show, Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn announced the automaker would invest $7 billion in North American plants in the next five years, hoping to boost sales significantly. That means the U.S. car market is about to get even more competitive. ""Competition is going to lead to more attractive prices,"" said Alex Gutierrez, senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. ""Each automaker will have to step up their game."" Toyota is the number one-selling carmaker globally, while GM holds the number two spot, reporting Tuesday that its global sales for 2013 rose 4% to 9.71 million vehicles.

205,"Opinion: Black tide of coal overwhelms climate goals. When policymakers and industry leaders gather next week for the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi, they will celebrate a vision of what most of us want tomorrow's energy system to be: clean, sustainable and available to all. While I share this wish for our energy future, the path we are currently on is bleak -- and black. Nothing does a better job of exposing the widening gap between hope and reality than the annual coal market outlook we released a few weeks ago. Maria van der Hoeven is executive director of the International Energy Agency. The opinions expressed are her own. There is no denying the controversial reality of coal and its dominance in power generation worldwide. No fuel draws the same ire, particularly for its polluting qualities both locally and in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. And yet no fuel is as responsible for powering the economic growth that has pulled billions out of poverty. As we look to the long term, we must ask what role coal has to play -- because there will be a role. But failure to make coal a cleaner source of energy will have enormous and tragic consequences. Fueled by seemingly insatiable demand in China and across Asia, coal use continues to soar. In the IEA's latest Medium-Term Coal Market Report, we project global demand for coal to rise by 2.3% per year, on average, until 2018. That may not seem like much, and it's slower growth than we've seen in recent years. But let me put that in perspective: Between now and 2018, global coal demand will increase by an amount greater than all of the coal that North and South America burned in 2012. Moreover, if current energy policies do not change, coal will overtake oil as the world's primary source of energy in the foreseeable future. This matters because a coal plant, once built, stays around for decades. This carries grave implications for climate change, for in its current form, coal is simply unsustainable. Coal-fired heat and power generation is the biggest single source of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions resulting from fuel combustion today. More than 60% of the rise in global CO 2 emissions since 2000 is due to the burning of coal to produce electricity and heat. And we should not overlook the health problems tied to local pollution produced by coal combustion. There are solutions to both the issues of local pollution and CO 2 emissions. Underground coal gasification is a form of clean coal technology that can address the former. Some major countries have recently announced policies to encourage the construction and use of highly efficient coal-fired power plants and to promote technology that captures CO 2 and buries it underground. We welcome these efforts as part of the broader push to clean up our energy system. Yet if nothing more than those emissions-reduction policy commitments and pledges announced to date are implemented, the long-term increase in average global temperatures will likely be well above the 2∞ Celsius ceiling agreed by governments. Radical action is needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions -- especially those from coal -- yet that radical action is disappointingly absent. Progress on capturing and storing carbon dixiode is effectively stalled, and a meaningful carbon price is missing. Moreover, even though we've known how to build efficient coal-fired power plants since the 1960s, most of the coal plants built since then -- and a large proportion of the ones being developed today -- are of the inefficient kind. When it comes to a sustainable energy profile, we are simply off track -- and coal is the elephant in the room. I take no pleasure in saying this, but if governments keep up their business-as-usual mindset then coal will play the biggest role in our energy future. Yet even if stronger policy action were taken now, coal will still be with us for a long time to come. The challenge, therefore, is to develop and implement technologies and policies to make it cleaner. I sincerely hope the leaders gathered in Abu Dhabi keep this in perspective as they seek solutions for tomorrow's energy.","Opinion: Black tide of coal overwhelms climate goals - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/news/economy/energy-coal-opinion/index.html
206,"France: Affairs! Scandal! And tax cuts. Facing a media storm over his private life, French President Francois Hollande unveiled a program of tax and spending cuts Tuesday in a bid to revive confidence in his country's stagnant economy. The eurozone's second biggest economy barely grew in 2013, acting as a drag on the region's wider recovery from its longest recession on record. French unemployment , at just under 11%, is higher than a year ago. ""The time has come to settle the most important problem facing France,"" he told reporters. ""We need to produce more, we need to produce better."" It was Hollande's first appearance before journalists since a French tabloid newspaper reported allegations that he was having an affair with a French actress . ""These are painful moments, but I have one principle -- private affairs are dealt with in private,"" he said. France's performance has fallen far behind that of Germany , and some weaker eurozone states, leading some analysts to label the country the ""sick man of Europe"". Elected in 2012 on a promise to put job creation before austerity, the Socialist president has been tinkering with reforms for over a year. But his early preference for raising taxes rather than cutting spending to bring government borrowing under control dismayed entrepreneurs, and modest labor market reforms have failed to persuade companies to invest. Hollande has been urged by his European partners and international institutions to be bolder with his economic reforms. And ratings agency S&P downgraded France in November, concerned that the government will be unable to restore the economy's competitiveness. The president took a different tone Tuesday, emphasizing the need to reduce the burden of payroll contributions, taxes and regulation to restore growth. ""We will not be able to reduce unemployment unless there is job creation by companies,"" he said.","French president changes tack to revive economy - Jan. 14, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/14/news/economy/france-economy/index.html

208,"MORE ON: If youíve ever needed an excuse to spend more time having fun under the covers, weíve got you sorted. New research has found that having sex can improve mental performance and increase neurogenesis (the production of new neurons) in the part of the brain where long term memories are formed, the hippocampus. Scientists at the University of Maryland found that middle-aged rats who had sex showed signs of improved cognitive function and ìhippocampalî function, reports The Atlantic . Having sex also helps balance out the effects of chronic stress, according to research conducted by Konkuk University in Seoul. They experimented with mice and found that sexual activity, ìcould be helpful for buffering adult hippocampal neurogenesis and recognition memory function against the suppressive actions of chronic stressî. But can this theory work in reverse? Do smarter people have more sex? Unfortunately, the answer is ìnoî. In fact, smarter teenagers tend to start having sex later in life. Having a high working memory decreases the likelihood of an early adolescent sexual debut, according to a 2012 study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. While having sex can increase the rate at which new brain cells are born, only effortless, successful learning increases their survival, according to leading psychologist Tracey J. Shors from the Centre for Collaborative Neuroscience at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ìYou can make new cells with exercise, Prozac and sex,î she said. ìIf you do mental training, youíll keep alive more cells that you produced.

Guests at Nizuc can book a tequila tasting with Verduzco. First up is Carzo Silver ó $14.50 a shot at A-Kan (corzo.com).

Second, we try the Partida Reposado ($16, parditatequila.com), a darker tequila that is aged between two months and a year in oak barrels. ìThis is called the Bentley of reposada,î says Verduzco.

Mezcal, sometimes called the father of tequila, is also made from agave leaves, but these leaves are baked. ìYou place the leaves in a huge hole in the ground,î Verduzco explains. ìThe baking takes 72 to 80 hours.î The result stings of alcohol, but is citrusy and floral. Alas, this shot of mezcal has no worm attached. ìIf you eat the worm,î Verduzco explains, ìyou get rid of the hangover.

211,"Father Damion, abbot at St. Joseph's Trappist Abbey, in Spencer, Mass., walks through the monks' meeting room. St. Joseph's is a community of 63 Trappistine monks, the largest in the United States. Photo: AP. SPENCER, Mass. ó For more than a century, Catholic Cistercian monks known as Trappists have been brewing and selling what many beer lovers consider some of the best in the world. Eight monasteries ó six in Belgium and one each in Holland and Austria ó produce the only beer recognized by the International Trappist Association as authentic Trappist beer. And starting Thursday, the 63 brothers of St. Josephís Abbey ó about an hourís drive west of Boston ó will join them, selling the first Trappist beer brewed outside Europe. Their ambitious venture was hardly met with enthusiasm by their exacting Trappist brothers in Europe. After all, for nearly 60 years the monks in Spencer, Mass., had been selling jams and jellies to help support their community. Now they were interested in the real family business: beer. The journey from jams to beer started almost five years ago when St. Josephís sent two monks on a fact-finding mission to the Belgian Beer Fest in Boston. Within hours, their European brothers were alarmed to learn of the inquiries. ìThe original skepticism was because we were outside of EuropeÖ and Americans,î said Father Isaac Keeley, the bald, jovial former potter who has been at St. Josephís for 35 years and now directs the brewing. ìAnd the fear we would go too big too fast.î Bottles of Spencer Trappist Ale brewed by the Trappistine monks of St. Josephís Abbey near Boston. Photo: AP. Keeley and another monk from St. Josephís packed up and moved to Belgium in December 2010 to see how their European brothers brew ó and to convince them that they could properly produce an American Trappist beer. The European monks werenít the only ones who needed convincing. Back at St. Josephís, a robust debate among the brothers was underway. Some were concerned about starting what would be the most expensive enterprise ever undertaken by the abbey. But everyone agreed the aging monastery buildings were getting increasingly expensive to maintain. In the end, more than 85 percent of the American brothers voted for the project. ìWe see it as a 50-100 year project. (Just) as weíre standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and built these building and supported the way of life, hopefully future generations will be able to stand on our shoulders, what we are doing ó and we see the brewery as part of that,î said Father Damian Carr, head of St. Josephís Abbey. The European monks, warming to the idea of an American Trappist beer, began giving close counsel to their Massachusetts brothers. The European monasteries made three strong recommendations: To brew beer of Trappist quality they must build a state-of-the-art brewery, hire a skilled brewing engineer, and brew just one kind of beer for the first five years. The St. Josephís monks set to work and built a multi-million-dollar brewery that would be the envy of almost any microbrewery in the world. Securing their bank loan ó an amount they wonít disclose ó was made easier by the success of the monksí previous business venture, ìTrappist Preserves.î The European brewers, wanting a beer that wouldnít damage the Trappist brand, agreed to help the Americans develop a good recipe. After more than 20 trial batches, the monks in Massachusetts settled on the recipe for what would become Spencer Trappist Ale, a ìrefectory aleî of 6.5 percent alcohol. The cloudy, golden beer is all-American yet rooted in European tradition with sweet, yeasty notes familiar to fans of other Trappist ales. With beer in his suitcase, Keeley flew last month to Belgium, seeking his brother monksí blessing. He first delivered a PowerPoint presentation on the new brewery, then poured glasses of Spencer Trappist Ale for his European counterparts. Spencer Brewery Director Father Isaac tastes a sample of Spencer ale wort, an early stage of fermentation, as Belgian brewing engineer Hubert de Halleux looks on at the Spencer Brewery in Spencer, Mass. ìThey approved it unanimously,î he said, ìand after the vote there was applause.î With the Europeans on board, a U.S. distribution deal was signed. Sales will only be in Massachusetts at first, but plans are to expand nationally and someday, internationally. On New Yearís Day, at their annual holiday party, the brewery team tapped a keg of the final product for the whole St. Josephís community ó the first time many of the brothers tasted the beer that will soon be synonymous with their monastery. Telling the story of that night, Keeley started to cry. ìThe keg was pouring beautifully. We had this great head on the beer,î he said. ìThe monks were coming back for seconds at least. And it just struck meÖ in a certain sense we have made it.î",Massachusetts monks to brew ëbest beer in the worldí | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/massachusetts-monks-to-brew-best-beer-in-the-world/

The number of officers charged includes those who allegedly cheated as well as those who may have known about what was happening but didnít alert higher-ups.

213,"David Booth beats the market without picking stocks. ""If you want to hold a market portfolio, that's fine...we think you can do better,"" says David Booth, chairman and co-CEO of Dimensional Fund Advisors. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) David Booth built Dimensional Fund Advisors on the idea that investors can't beat the market. The mutual fund company's assets now run to more than $300 billion. So what's the secret of Booth's smashing success? Beating the market. Long before it was fashionable, Booth, 67, bet his career on ""passive"" investing -- that is, buying and holding a representative slice of equities instead of trying to choose the next winners. As a grad student he was a research assistant to the economist who would later win a Nobel for showing that even smart investors can't predict stock prices. In the 1970s, Booth worked on one of the first institutional index funds, which simply held every listed stock on the New York exchange. He co-founded Dimensional in 1981 with a pioneering mutual fund that passively owned stocks of small companies. Dimensional does, however, preach that investors can capture a better long-run return by ""tilting"" their portfolios to favor certain parts of the market (for example, smaller companies). Performance also differs: The company's DFA U.S. Core Equity 1 ( DFEOX ) fund earned an annualized 19.6% over the past five years, compared with 18.4% for an index of the total stock market. It's tough to buy Dimensional funds: They're sold only through financial advisers who tend to work with the wealthy, and in 401(k)s and some 529 college savings plans. But you're sure to be hearing more ideas like Booth's. And bolder claims too. The heyday of what you might call the artisanal fund manager -- a stock picker who carefully selects, say, 50 or 100 companies -- is waning. The success of index funds, now 28% of fund assets and growing, is a big part of that. Some passive managers, however, are using historical patterns and statistical models to create funds that make broad strategic bets. Besides Dimensional, players now include BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager. Taking a more radical position is MIT economist Andrew Lo . He's aiming not only to improve on the academic theory that drives both traditional indexers and Dimensional but also to create a new breed of funds he hopes will be as transformative as the original index funds. What to expect in the stock market in 2014. Proponents of these different approaches can marshal intriguing evidence. There's also reason to be skeptical. Popular tilted strategies have done well in recent years, which can make it harder to see the risks they carry. And marketing, as much as research, is driving the industry's enthusiasm. ""Investors have woken up to the fact that it's hard to beat the market, and investment managers need a new story to tell,"" says Paul Baiocchi, an ETF analyst at the research firm IndexUniverse. ""This is the new story."" It's also the investing debate that matters now -- not the choice between passive and active stock picking, but between passive or passive with a twist. According to IndexUniverse, among exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in stocks, one in three employ one of these new strategies. Here's a close look at the arguments behind the ""do better"" portfolios and lessons you can apply to your own investing, even if you decide to stick with simpler funds. The Trailblazer: Tweaking the winning formula. Dimensional, which began as a two-man operation based in a Brooklyn apartment, has grown to 800 employees, with its headquarters in an airy, modern-art-filled campus on a hilltop in Austin. Booth's success allowed him to give $300 million to the graduate business program at the University of Chicago. It's now called Booth School of Business. That gift was not for nothing. The University of Chicago gave Booth not just his MBA but a front-row seat for an investing revolution. Booth and Dimensional co-founder Rex Sinquefield were students of Eugene Fama, who had developed a powerful idea called the ""efficient-markets hypothesis."" The basic premise: When new information that could drive a company's stock price up or down comes out -- a new product, say, or an accounting scandal -- information hits the street so quickly that it is instantly factored into prices. There is no reliable way for investors to beat the market. That's one reason, along with low costs, that index funds consistently beat the average fund manager. As of mid-2013, for example, 72% of U.S. stock funds lagged the S&P Composite 1500, an index of the broad market, over the past five years. Fama, who is on Dimensional's board, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 2013 for the efficient-markets hypothesis. But in the early 1990s he made other findings that were just as important to investors like Booth. Along with economist Ken French, Fama showed that small companies and value stocks -- those trading cheaply compared with the assets on their books -- tend to earn higher returns than the market. Dimensional's funds are vehicles for capturing such effects. The original fund, DFA U.S. MicroCap ( DFSCX ) , is an index-like portfolio of small companies. The newer U.S Core Equity 1, launched in 2005, owns a wider swath of the market but is weighted to smaller and cheaper. It charges annual fees of 0.19%, compared with as little as 0.04% for a plain index, but far less than the average 1.4% for stock funds. Tilting presents a ticklish problem. If there's evidence that certain stocks outperform, how can markets also be efficient? Why don't investors pile into those great stocks, bidding up prices and thereby eliminating the higher returns? ""They are riskier,"" explains Booth. Small companies often have untested business models. The value effect is less intuitive; it seems like a cheaper stock should be safer. Yet the discount could mean the market sees something wobbly in the business. James Montier, of the active fund managers GMO, says you may be disappointed if you get in on tilting now. ""They are not priced to work,"" he says. ""They are quite expensive."" Booth, of course, doesn't make such calls but cautions that a tweaked approach can leave you out of step with the market at times. U.S. MicroCap has annualized returns of 12.5% since its 1981 inception, compared with 11.6% for the S&P 500. But the fund lagged for almost a decade before the winds shifted. ""People were disillusioned, but they realized that for a long-term strategy, you've got to accept that risk and return are related,"" says Booth. ""We were able to defend it."" It's not that Dimensional never changes its thinking. Booth is excited about new research showing that companies with higher profits, relative to the assets on their books, seem to earn better returns. Dimensional is adding that factor to its tilts. ""The really good ideas come along about every decade or so,"" he says. The takeaway for yo u . If you can't get into a Dimensional fund, there are other ways to tilt. On the MONEY 50 recommended list, the Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF ( VBR ) captures both the value and size effects; it's earned an annualized 21.1% over five years, vs. 16.9% for the S&P 500. There's a lesson, too, even for those who prefer to stick with a broad-market index. Popular S&P 500 index funds tilt away from the small-cap effect because they hold more of the biggest stocks. A better core choice is Vanguard Total Stock Market ( VTI ) , which includes small companies.

214,"Stocks, bonds? In 2014, think cash. While major turning points in the market only truly become clear in hindsight, look closely enough and you can start to make out the hazy shape of things to come. After a five-year rally that has more than doubled the value of the S&P 500, stock prices at least by one measure of valuation are among the frothiest in history. Speculation is back, as the use of borrowed money to invest is nearing pre-financial-crisis highs. And then there's the fact it's been nearly 2 1/2 years since stock prices fell significantly. Pullbacks of 10% or more typically occur at least once a year. Normally when faced with overheated equities, you can simply sell some winners and buy more bonds, either to get you back to your target allocation or to invest more conservatively. That strategy paid off big in the 2000-02 bear market, when the S&P 500 lost 47% while government bonds maturing over four to 10 years returned 26%. But what happens if both stocks and bonds are primed to deliver subpar returns? That appears to be the situation now. A big reason stocks have climbed so much is that the Federal Reserve has bought up more than $2 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds in recent years to try to boost growth by holding down long-term interest rates and thus promote risk taking. So-called quantitative easing has worked, but it has also driven fixed income prices up and yields down. Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer for the Leuthold Group, says, ""There's now joint overvaluation in U.S. stocks and bonds."" The immediate concern: Now that the Fed has started shutting off its spigot in the face of an improving economy, the chances of rising interest rates prompting a selloff in stocks and bonds inevitably increase. Shortly after the Fed ended its two smaller rounds of quantitative easing -- in 2010 and 2011 -- the S&P 500 declined 16% and 19%, respectively. (Bond investors discounted QE's impact then, but lately they've shown they're convinced.) The bigger long-term worry: Above-average valuations mean the likelihood of disappointing returns over the next 10 years or so. What do you do? If you have decades to ride out the market's ups and downs, you don't have to do anything. 10 stock bets to make in 2014. But if retirement is closer than that, you want a strategy that offers some protection from a bad bear market and turns down the volatility in your portfolio at a time when you're unlikely to be richly rewarded for risk taking. Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, notes: ""When the price of everything goes up, it stands to reason these investments become less attractive to own."" In this article, you'll learn not only about moves you can make within your stock and bond holdings to cut risk but also about the importance of re-embracing a long-forgotten asset class -- cash. Stocks don't rise 150% every five years; bond prices don't soar when interest rates rise. So prepare for skimpier returns and higher risk. STOCKS: More expensive than you think. A popular way to tell if stocks are cheap or dear is to look at the market's price/earnings ratio using profit forecasts for the next 12 months. Based on this method, the S&P 500's P/E is 16, which is more than 15% higher than the market's long-run average. That's worrisome, but here's what's truly scary. If you calculate the market's P/E based not on projected profits but on 10 years of averaged earnings -- a more conservative and more reliably predictive method championed by Yale finance professor Robert Shiller -- the S&P 500's ratio is actually above 25. Over the past 130 years, there have been only a handful of periods in which the market's P/E has hit this level: 1901, 1928 to 1930, 1996 to 2002, and 2003 to 2007, just before the financial crisis. Each of those periods gave way to (or in the case of the irrational-exuberance era, included) a ferocious bear market. This note of caution isn't about making a short-term market call. Those periods also show that stocks can remain at frothy levels for years. In the current case, the S&P 500 just topped 25 in November. ""Sure, valuations can go higher from here,"" says Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory firm Research Affiliates. ""But that's a game I choose not to play."" That's because the long-term bet against the Shiller P/E is a loser. Since 1926, when the market's valuation has exceeded 25, the average inflation-adjusted annual return for stocks has been a mere 0.5% over the subsequent decade. (A five-year P/E calculated by the Leuthold Group yields a better, though still bad, result.) The average annual real return for stocks is about 7%. Freeman says quantitative easing, by lowering the cost of capital dramatically, has driven investors toward smaller companies that tend to be heavy borrowers. Thus far, that has worked out fine. Small-company stocks, which had been outpacing shares of large companies since 2000, got a second wind after the Fed's latest bond-buying program started in the fall of 2012. The problem is that valuations for small caps are way up. Historically, small stocks have traded at around the same P/E as blue chips, based on five years of average profits, according to the Leuthold Group. Today they're 25% more expensive. While small stocks outperform large ones over long periods, this isn't the time -- or the price -- to be buying up the little guys. Dial back your small-stock exposure, says Ramsey, by the amount they're overvalued -- say, 20% to 25%, and move that into blue chips. This is actually not a big step. Assuming you hold a fairly typical blend of mutual funds, for every $100 of your money invested in U.S. stocks, around $70 will be held in large-company shares and $30 in smaller names. A 25% reduction in this case works out to around an eight-percentage-point change. Then trim your stock allocation five percentage points or so from sectors that have directly and disproportionately gained from artificially low yields. Among them: real estate, which got a boost from record low borrowing costs, and high dividend-paying utilities, which were considered an alternative source of income in a low-rate world. If you own a REIT or utility fund through a 401(k) or IRA, selling won't trigger taxes. Own them in a taxable account, though, and you'll have choices to make. You can offset capital gains by selling some emerging-market holdings, which are largely down over the past three years. If you don't have losses and don't want a tax bill, you can start putting new money elsewhere. Move some money into foreign stocks. Sharon Hill, a portfolio manager with Delaware Investments, says relative to the U.S., foreign equities are downright attractively priced. Global stocks are selling at a 20% discount to domestic shares, even though historically they've traded on par with U.S. securities. So shifting out of U.S. stocks and into the broad foreign markets is a sound way to reduce risk, she says. But do so within reason. Vanguard studied the usefulness of foreign stocks and found something interesting: While adding international exposure gradually reduces volatility in your portfolio, the diversification benefit starts to dissipate once your overseas weighting jumps above around 40%. If you have only minimal international exposure, shift five to 10 percentage points toward overseas holdings using a broad-based fund such as Vanguard Total International Stock ( VGTSX ) or Dodge & Cox International Stock ( DODFX ) , both in the MONEY 50. If you already keep more than a third of your equities abroad, go up to 40% but no more. BONDS: This time they're not a safe bet. Look back over the major bear markets for stocks, and in almost every case bonds did an admirable job of limiting the damage. On several occasions, in fact, fixed income delivered double-digit gains. Yet with market interest rates at such low levels thanks to Fed policy, it's hard to imagine that bonds can offer you that kind of shelter this time. Bull markets in stocks are usually killed by rising interest rates, which also crimp bond prices. In the past, however, bond yields were high enough to compensate you for the drop in value. For example, when the Fed lifted rates in 1973, which helped trigger the equity bear market of 1973-74, 10-year Treasury notes were yielding over 7%. So even though bond prices fell that year, intermediate government bonds returned nearly 5%. Today the math simply doesn't work. If the 10-year note's interest rate was to rise by one percentage point, a broad-market bond fund would probably lose about 6% of its value. Tack on a yield of less than 3%, and you're losing money. That's pretty much what happened last year when investors feared the Fed would start to taper its bond-buying program. And the average long-term government bond fund, which is very sensitive to interest rates, racked up a 12% loss. It's not just short-term returns you have to worry about. The Leuthold Group studied the historical performance of bonds and found that there is a simple rule of thumb: Whatever the yield on 10-year Treasuries currently is, that's about the annual total return you can expect from bonds over the next decade. Today that yield is a historically low 2.8%. That's around half the average return for bonds. Your best moves. Lend less to Uncle Sam. You can diminish risks in your bond portfolio by taking 20% to 25% of your exposure to funds with big stakes in U.S. government debt and shifting that money into other segments of fixed income. For instance, yields on municipal bonds look relatively attractive -- especially since the improving economy is strengthening state and city finances. So, too, do high-quality corporate bonds. Don't buy a lot of junk. Just be careful with higher-yielding securities, such as junk bonds, strategists say. When yields are low, investors tend to plow money into higher-paying stuff. But eventually all that buying drives yields down, as we've seen in the past year. Now you're often not being paid enough for the extra credit risk you're taking, except possibly with debtors classified just slightly below investment grade. It's not just the higher possibility of default that's a problem. ""You take on a different level of risk that's more highly correlated with stocks,"" says Mary Ellen Stanek, director of asset management for Baird. Indeed, U.S. government bonds often go up when stocks go down. Junk historically moves more or less in sync with equities. ""At the end of the day,"" Stanek says, ""you want your bond portfolio to truly behave like a bond portfolio when it most needs to."" CASH: Bulk up on a forgotten asset. Before the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan hammered interest rates into the ground starting in the 1990s, cash was a part of many prudent investors' portfolios. A savings account or money-market fund lowered portfolio volatility, provided income, and allowed holders to scoop up bargains when stocks fell. Given today's stock and bond valuations and the fact that interest rates are bound to rise, ""there's nothing wrong with pulling 10% off the table and sitting in cash,"" says James Stack, a market historian and editor of the InvesTech Research newsletter. This is especially true, he says, for investors who are within 10 to 15 years of retirement or are already retired. Younger investors with more time to recover from subpar returns don't have to play as much defense. But, Stack says, they may choose to go to cash to be opportunistic -- to jump on stocks once prices fall substantially. Greg Schultz, a principal with Asset Allocation Advisors, thinks you can go even higher -- to around 15% cash, by reducing both stock and bond holdings. That may sound radical, but even at today's depressing cash yields, many successful portfolio managers keep 5% to 10% of their assets in cash when they can't find attractively priced investments to buy. And there are plenty of things that a stash of cash can do for you. Your best moves. You'll turn paper profits into actual ones. Since selling winners will trigger capital gains taxes, do it in your tax-sheltered 401(k)s and IRAs as part of your rebalancing, along with the stock and bond moves suggested above. Alternatively, you can simply start putting money into an online-only bank savings account that now pays close to 1% interest and build up a position during the year. You can hedge your bond holdings. In a rising interest rate environment, cash will progressively gain value at the same time as some of your bonds are apt to lose ground. You'll still be in the game. Even if the stock market continues to climb, having a 10% stake in cash won't prevent you from taking part in the gains. A balanced portfolio with a 60% stock/40% bond allocation, for instance, returned 15.3% last year. Had you shifted that to a 55% stock/35% bond/10% cash allocation, you'd have earned one point less. And you will stay strong. Because cash will cut losses and volatility, it just might help you stay the course in the rest of your portfolio, says Schultz. ""Yes, there's an opportunity cost, but common sense tells you that if things are richly priced today, there will come a time when they will be cheaper,"" he says. Money in the bank will help you handle the selloff while positioning yourself for the eventual rebound.","Stocks, bonds?

215,"Moody's sets the mood on Street; will RBI give it a boost? All the signs are in favour of the Reserve Bank not going for a rate hike at its January 28 policy meet. Experts are also saying so, with some suggesting that in fact a rate cut could be possible if not a status quo. Inflation looks like being reined in, the World Bank is projecting an above 6 per cent growth for India in the coming financial year and top global ratings agency Moody's says a downgrade for India is not on the cards. All the signs are in favour of the Reserve Bank not going for a rate hike at its January 28 policy meet. Experts are also saying so, with some suggesting that in fact a rate cut could be possible if not a status quo. ""It depends on whether Raghuram Rajan ( RBI chief ) takes a purely purest technical view of inflation, in which case it makes sense for him to wait for the trend, wait for a few more data points, or whether as in the past in December there was a suspicion that may be he was guided by political economy considerations; and could perhaps cut interest rates ,"" says Mythili Bhusnurmath, consulting editor, ET. Suprising the Street on the positive, December WPI inflation came in at 6.16%. The figure was released on Wednesday, and is much below the consensus of 7%; and at a five-month low. Easing inflation comes as a big positive for the Street ahead of the Reserve Bank's policy meet on January 28. The little apprehensions over the RBI going for a 25 bps rate at the policy meet would now be ebbing. In fact, December CPI inflation, released on Monday, also came in at 9.87% as against 11.24% for the month of November. Last year, when the RBI for a series of policy rate hikes, the premise was the high inflation figure; but then much cannot be read from the current inflation numbers because Raghuram had at December policy meet said that no single-point data would determine the central bank's policy moves. If we look at the industrial production data, it contracted for a second straight month in November. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) fell 2.1% in November, marking the second consecutive month of contraction, data released by the statistics office on Friday showed. The consensus was for a modest 1% rise in November. A 21.5% drop in the production of consumer non-durables just added to the worries on the consumer story. ""The inflation numbers, overall economy suggest that the RBI has some room to sort of pause a little bit on tightening measures, though core inflation is still picking up,"" Mark Konyn, CEO, Cathay Conning Asset Management, told ET Now. ""Yes, from the purely near-term, short-term perspective inflation figure is kind of comforting for investors, specifically because there was a part of the market which was worried about a much more aggressive stance by RBI, specifically given the data points we have seen over the last couple of months.

216,"WASHINGTON: The World Bank has projected India's economy will grow over 6 per cent in 2014-15 and 7.1 per cent by 2016-17 as global demand recovers and domestic investment increases. In China, growth is estimated to stay flat in 2014 at 7.7 per cent, slowing to 7.5 per cent for the next two years, reflecting deleveraging and less reliance on policy-induced investment. Global GDP growth may firm up to 3.2 per cent this year from 2.4 per cent in 2013, stabilising at 3.4 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2015 and 2016, respectively, the World Bank said in its Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report released today. According to the report, the global economy is projected to strengthen this year, with growth picking up in developing countries and high-income economies appearing to be finally turning the corner five years after the global financial crisis. ""Growth appears to be strengthening in both high-income and developing countries, but downside risks continue to threaten the global economic recovery,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. ""The performance of advanced economies is gaining momentum and this should support stronger growth in developing countries in the months ahead. Still, to accelerate poverty reduction, developing nations will need to adopt structural reforms that promote job creation, strengthen financial systems and shore up social safety nets,"" he said. According to the report, in South Asia, weaker growth in India, following several years of rising inflation and current account deficits, has opened up a large negative output gap, which is projected to gradually close as the economy slowly recovers. Better Indian performance will be heavily reflected in the region's growth, which is expected to strengthen to 5.7 per cent in 2014 and about 6.7 per cent in 2016, it said. Growth in South Asia is estimated to have been a very weak 4.6 per cent in 2013, mainly reflecting weakness in India. Growth appeared to be recovering toward the end of 2013, and regional GDP on a calendar-year basis is projected to slowly accelerate to about 6.7 per cent in 2016, mainly reflecting stronger growth in India and a cyclical recovery in investment and external demand, it said. ""India's growth is projected to rise to just over 6 per cent in FY2014-15 and to increase to 6.6 per cent in FY2015-16 and 7.1 per cent in FY2016-17,"" the World Bank said. ""Growth in India will be led by recovery in global demand and an increase in domestic investment, subject to downside risks."" Pakistan's growth is expected to moderate slightly to 3.4 per cent in FY2013-14, reflecting necessary fiscal tightening, and then rise to 4.5 per cent in the medium term, it said. Kaushik Basu, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President at the World Bank, said the global economic indicators show improvement. But one does not have to be especially astute to see there are dangers that lurk beneath the surface, he said, adding that the euro area is out of recession but per capita incomes are still declining in several countries.",World Bank projects India's growth at over 6% in 2014-15 - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/28840122.cms
217,"India is expected to witness a slow economic recovery in the second half of this year if global growth increases, Moody's Investors Service said in a report today. Meanwhile, Bloomberg cites Moody's rating analyst Thomas Byrne as saying that a downgrade for India is not on the cards. Moody's has an investment grade rating of Baa3 on India with a stable outlook. The report further says that India's inflation and interest rates should decline. ""However, the outcome of national elections this year could also affect growth, depending on how it impacts sentiment and policies,"" said Byrne. ""In addition, India's government debt ratios and fiscal deficits will remain higher than those of similarly rated peers in 2014. Social welfare measures, for instance, such as the Food Security Act passed last year, will raise the government's medium-term expenditure commitment,"" said Byrne. ""Nonetheless, the structure of India's government debt - which is owed mostly domestically, in domestic currency, at relatively low real rates, and at relatively long tenors - has mitigated stress on the government's fiscal position."" Talking about South and Southeast Asia, Moody's said that sovereign ratings here would be largely stable in 2014, reflecting the agency's expectation that global growth prospects will improve while global risks will decline. Moody's says that almost three quarters of sovereigns, that is 85 of 124, rated by the agency carry stable rating outlooks, compared with fewer than two-thirds at the start of last year. Moody's also points out that emerging economies of South and Southeast Asia will continue to face heightened credit pressures in 2014, owing in part to the US Federal Reserve's tapering of its expansive quantitative easing policy. ""In Indonesia, the widening of the current account deficit over the past two years has given way to concerns about the sustainability of the country's external payments position. While the policy response has shifted towards stabilization, political risks could rise, ahead of elections later this year,"" Byrne said. In contrast, other large countries in the region have seen a firming of credit fundamentals, especially in terms of growth performance, the report said. Moody's concludes that overall, sovereign creditworthiness will be more vulnerable to common global risks than to region-specific exposures in 2014. The shared global risks include a disorderly unwinding of monetary stimulus in the US, persistently elevated event risks in the euro area, and uncertainty about commodity prices. ""The interaction of these global risks with country-specific factors will determine the credit implications,"" said Byrne. Byrne was speaking at a Moody's briefing in Singapore, titled Sovereign Global Outlook, earlier in the day.","India's ratings downgrade not on the cards, says Moody's - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indias-ratings-downgrade-not-on-the-cards-says-moodys/articleshow/28877632.cms
218,"NEW DELHI: Congress' one-day AICC session in Delhi on Friday comes at a time when the party faces its worst crises. If crippling electoral routs, tainted image of its central government, surging inflation , economic slowdown and administrative paralysis were not enough, there is BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi's aggressive anti-Congress polemics and Aam Aadmi Party's wild-card entry that make Congress' cup of woes overflow. The never-ending bad news for the Congress-led UPA government has prompted many talking heads in the Capital to predict that the April-May elections would see Congress' Lok Sabha tally going below its lowest of 114, won in 1999 polls. While three months is a very long time in politics, the crisis and tension in the Grand Old Party is clearly visible. Many top leaders fear politics could spin out of control by the time of the Lok Sabha polls. Apart from reinforcing the leadership of Rahul Gandhi , the AICC session, therefore, is a political choreography designed to show supporters, potential allies and its constituency that Congress is still in fighting mode with a definite agenda, strategy and vision, according to senior party leaders. That intention notwithstanding, the party faces multiple challenges: Question of Leadership Congress rout in last year's assembly polls has raised questions on effectiveness of style and inner-party experiments conducted by its vice-president Rahul Gandhi. There is also the question whether he would be projected as Congress prime ministerial candidate. While the AICC session will project Rahul as the leader under whom Congress will fight election and may even elevate him with a new designation in the party, sources say leaders are divided on announcing him as PM candidate. Some leaders argue Rahul should be made PM candidate for two reasons: Voters seek clarity on its leader and Narendra Modi enjoys an advantage here. They also argue projecting Gandhi as PM candidate would galvanise the party which can also project a contrasting picture of leadership to sections wary of Modi. Those who oppose this course argue that it would only help Modi's gameplan of making it a 'presidential poll' - a clash of personalities and not ideologies and programmes. They say Modi calling Rahul 'shahzada' (Indira Gandhi was 'gungi gudia' and Sonia Gandhi 'videsi nari' to rivals) is aimed at making it a Modi Vs Rahul fight. Hence, senior leader Digvijaya Singh's remarks that it went against Congress tradition to name a PM and only CPP elects PM may be reflective of the views of the party leadership.",ET Analysis: Reinforce the leadership of Rahul Gandhi in AICC session - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/et-analysis-reinforce-the-leadership-of-rahul-gandhi-in-aicc-session/articleshow/28865394.cms
219,"NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi is unlikely to be announced as Congress's prime ministerial candidate on January 17 or any time soon. The big, immediate change in Congress is not Rahul's elevation but his sister, Priyanka Gandhi, taking a far larger and critical role in the party, including greater involvement in national electoral planning. But she will not take a formal post in the party even as her political work extends beyond helping her brother and mother manage their constituencies. There's also no likely change in Rahul and Sonia Gandhi's personal Lok Sabha battle plans. They will stand, respectively, from Amethi and Rae Bareli, the two traditional Nehru-Gandhi constituencies in UP. Following Aam Aadmi Party's Kumar Vishwas' aggressive foray in Amethi, there had been reports that Rahul Gandhi may look for a second constituency. But the Gandhi scion is likely to stick to his traditional seat. Key Congress leaders at senior and critical strategy-making positions in the party told ET, on the condition they not be identified, that ""thinking at the highest level"" is not in favour of announcing Rahul Gandhi as the PM candidate any time soon. If there's a rethink, these leaders said, it can always be ""done later"". They also said Priyanka Gandhi playing a larger strategic and planning role is a key part of Congress' 2014 strategy. Her involvement has been going up since the assembly elections, a Congress leader said, and it will go up even more, he added. A number of senior Congress ministers, P Chidambaram and Manish Tiwari among them, had publicly called for Rahul Gandhi's elevation. Senior Congress strategists ET spoke to say they expect party rank and file to express a strong demand for Rahul Gandhi's elevation. ""There may be some ""commotion and drama on January 17"", a senior functionary said. But he added, ""there is unlikely to be any significant announcement"". There has been considerable media speculation about Rahul Gandhi's elevation ever since a comment by Sonia Gandhi in December that Congress will ""announce a PM candidate at an appropriate time.""

Those who understand politics and those who understand branding ó ET spoke to a number of experts in both the fields ó are coming to the same strong conclusion from different premises.

Political observers and political scientists base their argument on lack of rhetorical heft, less-than-impressive electoral performance and questions about general political ability. This newspaper had argued, in its edition dated January 8 (For RG, a Papal Guide to People), Gandhi should refuse the elevation even if it is offered and instead initiate a process of radical organisational reform in Congress. Prasoon Joshi , executive chairman, CEO & chief creative officer, McCann Worldgroup India, says the problem with Gandhi as a PM candidate is that voters have been subjected to too long a teaser campaign. ""From marketing logic, I think, there has not been enough product experience. The teaser campaign of this product has gone longer than the real campaign. Can the product live up to the expectation?"" says Joshi. He also pointed out that ""people don't know enough about Rahul"".

221,"Time to get on a spending diet. The biggest bite of an American's budget goes to housing and transportation. (Money Magazine) Now that the season of gluttony has passed, you may be looking back on your bank and credit card statements with a twinge of regret. Forty-six percent of shoppers had anticipated that they would spend beyond their holiday budgets, an October survey by management consulting firm Accenture found. And it's safe to assume many more have been unpleasantly surprised as the bills roll in. Just as January is a time of reckoning on the scale, it can also be a time to hit the reset button on spending. The key is to find sustainable cuts that make enough of a difference. ""The latte police have it wrong: Skipping a coffee won't get you to financial freedom,"" says Brian O'Connor, author of The $1,000 Challenge , which documents his goal of cutting a grand from his monthly budget. ""But you can find significant savings by eliminating or seeking cheaper alternatives for things you don't care much about."" Ready to commit to a money diet? Use these budget-trimming tactics. Count your calories. Before you can slash your expenses, you need to know what they are. Rather than striving to document every spent dollar for weeks -- a tedious and anxiety-producing exercise -- make a list that's simply good enough, suggests New York financial therapist Amanda Clayman. Just go through credit card and bank statements to tally your monthly costs as best you can. Then determine what percentage of income goes toward necessities (mortgage, transportation, etc.) and what percentage to wants. Ideally, you'd allocate your money so that you're saving at least 20%, while spending a max of 50% on must-haves and 30% on discretionary costs, says Amelia Warren Tyagi, who co-authored All Your Worth with her mother, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Stacking your spending against those benchmarks can show you where and how much to cut. Start with meat and potatoes. Take a hard look at your biggest costs -- like your home, wheels, insurance, and food -- before assessing more minor expenses like lattes. As Tyagi says, ""If you've got an elephant in the room, don't focus on the curtains."" Biggest tax changes you'll see in 2014. Re-shop these costs. You may find savings even in seemingly nonnegotiable line items -- like commuting. Someone driving 30 miles roundtrip 22 days a month at current gas prices in a car that gets 22 miles per gallon spends more than $3,000 a year, not including parking. Carpooling could cut those costs in half. While it takes time and an embrace of change to tackle these expenses, the savings can be substantial enough to allow you to drink as many lattes as you please, says Portsmouth, N.H., financial planner Michael Rubin, author of Beyond Paycheck to Paycheck . Cooking at home when you'd normally order in Chinese requires a sacrifice every time you get the urge. Ditching cable in favor of Hulu Plus or finally unloading that musty old storage unit demands action only once -- and either move could save you hundreds a year. Cut back on empty carbs. Reducing day-to-day discretionary spending is where we tend to feel deprived. For best results, maintain the small luxuries you love, such as movies or manicures. Instead, focus on trimming spending you don't care much about, O'Connor says. Watch for upgrades that don't make much difference in your life. For example, do you really need premium toiletries? To figure out what's truly important to you, go all-cash for a week. Using paper money -- instead of credit or even debit -- forces you to pay attention to costs and prioritize your purchases. It also keeps good intentions from being derailed by impulse buying. ""Cash never sends you a bill,"" says Tyagi. That's something most of us will appreciate this month.","Time to get on a spending diet - Jan. 13, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/01/pf/spending-budget.moneymag/index.html
222,"Winning at investing made simple. Served on a silver platter: the right portfolio strategy and investing well for retirement. (Money Magazine) Here are just a few of the ways Wall Street pros try to eke out an edge in the market. You can't do any of them: With a subscription to the Bloomberg online news service (price: about $20,000 a year), traders can instantly see anything from the location of oil tankers around the globe to supply-chain maps of a company's vendors and customers. Hedge fund managers who invest in drug and technology companies tap into ""expert networks"" of executives and scientists paid for their specialized knowledge. In some cases, it's been charged, traders have also illegally gotten inside information through these contacts. Half of stock trades are made by automated ""high-frequency"" programs; it takes 7/10,000ths of a second to buy or sell on the New York Stock Exchange, says the Tabb Group, down from a horse-and-buggy 10 seconds eight years ago. You can't get a jump on this crowd. You can't even compete with them. Chances are, the professional managers you hire via a mutual fund, for 1% of assets or more per year, won't be able to stay ahead either. In October, Ray Dalio, one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world, told a conference audience that ""going forward, most investors are not going to be able to produce alpha."" ""Alpha"" is finance jargon for outperforming the market after accounting for risk. In truth, the search for alpha has always been something of a snipe hunt; the word was first used in a 1967 article that showed that most mutual funds didn't deliver it, especially after subtracting fees. Two things have changed since then: More pros admit the alpha game is over, and perhaps more important for you, investing has never been better for those willing to stop playing. In the words of Tadas Viskanta, editor of the finance blog Abnormal Returns, there's wisdom in reaching for ""investment mediocrity."" Today, just as in 1967, most professionals can't beat an index that tracks the stock market. ""The paradox,"" says Viskanta, ""is that the less effort you put in, the better off you are."" And recently, he notes, perfect mediocrity has grown more attainable, as index-based investing has moved steadily closer to free. For as little as 0.04% of assets per year -- that's $4 for every $10,000 you've invested -- and often with no broker commission, you can buy an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that follows most of the U.S. stock market and delivers its return. This year's Investor's Guide starts from the idea that index funds and a buy-and-hold stance should be the default approach for long-term wealth builders. With that in mind, MONEY has rebuilt our basic investing tool set: Our list of recommended funds is now the MONEY 50 , streamlined from 70. Not all the funds are index trackers, but the core choices are low-cost, highly diversified portfolios for the long run. For many investors, a portfolio balanced among one broad U.S. stock fund, an international fund, and one or two bond funds is all you need. The MONEY 50 makes building that portfolio easy. Yet even if you decide to stick with a simplified strategy, that doesn't mean every investment puzzle you'll face has been solved. The stories in this guide will help you think through your approach to the three biggest questions you still face as you save for retirement. These funds make security selection automatic, but they don't help at all with the question of how much risk you want to take. The standard rule of thumb says you should start out with a high allocation to equities and gradually ""glide"" that down as you age. These days fund companies often focus less on their stock-picking prowess and more on designing all-in-one ""target date"" funds that do this asset allocating for you. Yet as you'll see in "" How much should you hold in stocks? "", the theory and practice of lifetime asset allocation are all over the map. Question No. 2: What if high stock and bond returns are really over? If you're a just-own-the-market purist, you don't ask if stocks are cheap or expensive. You assume it's too hard to outwit the hive-mind intelligence of the crowd. Over the short run that's almost certainly true. But there's evidence that the price of stocks relative to measures of their value like earnings and assets can provide a clue about returns over the course of a decade. Related: Money 50: Best mutual funds and ETFs. Stocks are now priced at about 21 times the five-year average of their earnings. According to research from the Leuthold Group advisory firm, when the market's price-to-earnings ratio is between 20 and 25, over the next 10 years stocks have delivered an annualized return of only 3% after accounting for inflation. Combine that with a gloomy outlook for bonds. Current yields are an indicator of future returns, and with the 10-year Treasury at 2.8%, you may be lucky to carve out 1% after inflation. "" Stocks, bonds? In 2014, think cash ,"" will help you think through your strategy so that you can thrive in a world where today's high-asset prices could repress tomorrow's returns. Question No. 3: Can I ever do better? Maybe. Even some advocates of index investing say there may be ways to outperform. But the extra bump doesn't come from tearing into company balance sheets or, as famed Fidelity manager Peter Lynch used to say, ""buying what you know."" It comes from ""tilting"" a portfolio of hundreds of securities to take advantage of anomalies that have shown up in historical stock returns. One is the value effect, the tendency of stocks with low prices relative to their earnings or asset value to outperform over time. Likewise, there seems to be a small-company premium. For a shot at earning these boosts, you don't buy a portfolio of 40 or 50 small-caps or bargain stocks. Instead, you buy an index or index-like fund that gives more weight to such shares. You'll need nerve: Larry Swedroe of Buckingham Asset Management, who recommends tilting, says the strategy trailed the S&P 500 badly in the late 1990s; in the past decade, though, an index of small value stocks earned an extra 2% annualized. ""You have to be able to live through it,"" he says. ""The New Faces of Stock Picking"" profiles a pioneer in low-cost, tilted portfolios as well as other quantitatively driven thinkers searching for ways investors can carve out advantages. Instead of hunting for the inside scoop, they crunch data and use insights into investors' behavioral blind spots. A caution: Now that star fund managers have faded, Wall Street is cranking out lots of ETFs. For every robust new idea, there's likely to be a dozen more that are nothing but savvy marketing tied to a hot short-term trend. Investing may be simple now, but you'll still need the discipline not to chase the latest market beater, plus the patience to stick to a long-term strategy even when it's out of favor. Simple? Yes, but not always easy. OWN THE WORLD, FOR NEXT TO NOTHING. You can build a solid portfolio with just three investments. Here are examples using ETFs and index mutual funds:","Winning at investing made simple - Jan. 10, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/01/investing/investing-strategies.moneymag/index.html
223,"WASHINGTON ó The Obama administration could have prevented the murderous terrorist attack on the US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, a Senate Intelligence Committee report concludes. The scathing, 85-page, bipartisan report laid most of the blame on the State Department under then-Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, citing its failure to increase security, despite warnings about a growing terrorist threat. ìThe State Department should have increased its security posture more significantly in Benghazi based on the deteriorating security situation,î said the report, released Wednesday. To underscore the stinging criticism, it added bluntly that the attack was ìpreventable.î Hillary Clinton Photo: Getty Images. The findings fueled criticism that has dogged President Obama and Clinton since the Sept. 11, 2012, assault that killed US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans at the mission and a nearby CIA safe house. The report does not directly implicate Obama or Clinton in the decisions that left the mission vulnerable or in the chaotic response to the attacks. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said that the administration ìstonewalledî the investigation into who made the command decisions. The report came out on the same day homeland-security experts warned a House panel that Obama had ìno coherentî strategy to fight a resurgent al Qaeda in Libya, Syria and Iraq. ìIf we donít do something more than weíre doing now . . . weíre going to get attacked again,î former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) told the House Homeland Security Committee. Lieberman, the former chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said the Benghazi attack ìwas obviously a terrorist attack,î despite the administrationís reluctance to say so in the immediate aftermath. The Senate report also blasted mistakes by the intelligence community, the Pentagon and even Stevens, who declined offers of added security. The report blamed the intelligence community for immediately concluding that the attack stemmed from a spontaneous protest over an American-made video that mocked Islam. The intelligence community ìtook too long to correct these erroneous reports, which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers,î it said. The findings contradicted accusations, mostly by Republicans, that the White House and the department doctored CIA talking points to downplay terrorism. Stevens was faulted for turning down extra security that was twice offered by Army Gen. Carter Ham, then the head of the US command in Africa. But it also documented that Stevens sent cables to the State Department requesting more security, including one that went out less than a month before the deadly raid. The report chastised the Pentagon for not having military assets at the ready in the region and blasted the FBI for not yet bringing the terrorists to justice. The report noted the ìlawless and chaoticî situation in Libya as a factor complicating the hunt for the terrorists, including the deaths of at least 15 people involved in the FBI investigation in Benghazi since the attacks. ìIt is unclear whether their killings were related to the Benghazi investigation,î the report said.",Senate report slams Obama administration on Benghazi | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/senate-report-slams-obama-administration-on-benghazi/
224,"The answer could easily have been construed as a diss on Patriots receiver Julian Edelman, who caught 105 passes this season despite starting only 11 of 16 games. But it wasnít. The intent of Adamsí answer was more to illustrate the greatness of Broncos receiver Wes Welker than it was meant to be an insult to Edelman, Welkerís replacement in New England. ìI canít compare the two because Wes is Ö heís something special,íí Adams said. ìHe can jive up the ball and then speed out and have you off balance. Edelman, he doesnít do that. Heís a one-speed guy. He doesnít have the same ability or the quickness that Wes has in the slot. I guess that is the main difference between them. But I donít know if they use him the same as they used Wes because theyíre totally different players.î Itís possible Adamsí quote landed on a bulletin board in Foxborough, Mass., but if it did its message is misguided. Welker actually had 32 fewer catches than Edelman this season, though he had a career-high 10 touchdowns to Edelmanís six, but that was more a product of Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning having many more options to throw the ball to than Tom Brady had in New England this season. Welker, too, played only 13 games, missing time with a concussion. Sundayís AFC Championship Game in Denver will mark the second time Welker has faced his former team since the Patriots curiously opted not to re-sign him after the 2012 season. He had four catches for 31 yards on Nov. 24 while Edelman had nine catches for 110 yards and two touchdowns in the Patriotsí 34-31 comeback win. Welker, who caught 672 passes and 37 touchdowns in six seasons with the Patriots, said Wednesday heís glad to have gotten that first meeting with his former team out of the way so this week it is not such a novelty. ìThere was just a lot of stuff going on during that week,íí he said. ìIím glad to have all that stuff over with and really just focus on the game and get ready for it.î Broncos coach John Fox said Welker has been ìexactly what we thought we were getting.íí ìEven people in the New England organization said that we would enjoy coaching him, and we have,íí Fox said. ìHe came in, made a pretty big impact. The fact that he was voted captain and just got here is a pretty good indicator of what his peers and teammates think of him. Heís fit in exactly what we thought he would be, and thatís important.î Manning has viewed Welker as a godsend, the ultimate outlet receiver when in trouble. ìA lot of things that a lot of people thought about Wes as an opponent all proved to be true once he joined us as a teammate,íí Manning said. ìI always assumed that he was an extremely competitive guy that loved football and a guy that loved to work, loved to practice. The way he played ó I saw him many a time play Colts versus the Patriots ó so to have him become a Bronco, all those things checked out. ìHeís been a fun guy to play with, Iíll say that.î He is, however, not a fun guy to cover. Welker, in fact, might be the most difficult receiver to cover in the league out of the slot, where he lines up most of the time. ìWhat makes him damn near unstoppable is that man throwing him the ball [Manning],íí Broncos safety Omar Bolden said. ìTheyíre in sync with one another and you can tell the chemistry is there and theyíre on the same page every time they step on that field. For some reason he always finds himself in a situation where heís able to pick a hole in the defense, and any time you give that man some space in the open field he can hurt you.íí Broncos veteran cornerback Champ Bailey, who has had his share of battles with Welker as an opponent over the years, said: ìThereís not a part of his game that heís weak at.íí",Wes Welker invaluable piece to explosive Denver offense | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/wes-welker-invaluable-piece-to-explosive-denver-offense/

Smith during his crisis with Woodson and Knicks brass that has led to two full-game benchings in the last four contests, having lost his spot as first wing off the bench to rookie Tim Hardaway Jr. Anthony repeatedly has said the Knicks need Smith on the court but wonít interfere. Anthony is a longtime teammate of Smith back to their Denver days. But as The Post reported in 2012, he had his concerns about Smith joining him in New York because of his baggage. But thatís not enough persuade Anthony to leave the Knicks, according to Woodson. ìThereís a concern, but again Meloís wearing a Knick uniform,î Woodson said on his weekly ESPN Radio appearance. ìI think Melo loves playing in New York.

226,"The e-mail came up during Ketchumís testimony Wednesday in Manhattan Bankruptcy Court over whether Dish founder Ergen, who was actually behind the debt buys, acted improperly. LightSquared forbade strategic buyers like Dish from owning the debt, and current LightSquared front man, billionaire Phil Falcone, has accused Ergen of buying the debt on the sly to win LightSquaredís spectrum for Dish. Indeed, Dish proposed buying some of LightSquaredís spectrum last summer for $2.2 billion, but the television provider dropped its bid last week as the trial was getting started over the legitimacy of Ergenís $800 million debt position. If he loses the trial, Ergen could find himself getting pushed to the back of the line when it comes to recoveries. On Monday, Ergen testified that he hid his debt buys to maintain his privacy and keep the price down. But on Wednesday, lawyers for LightSquared suggested that at least one of Ergenís hired hands also considered fibbing about Ergenís involvement in the debt. Another e-mail that cropped up Wednesday was from The Post to Ketchum seeking comment on a story the paper was planning to run in May 2012, revealing that Ergen was behind the purchases by SoundPoint Capital, Ketchumís hedge fund. Ketchum forwarded the e-mail to Kiser, saying, ìwe should discuss whether we should both employ a more strenuous strategy around denial.î ìWere you trying to mislead people Ö that this had nothing to do with Charlie Ergen?îî LightSquared lawyery Michael Hirshfeld asked Ketchum. ìI donít recall,î Ketchum said. E-mails filed with the court suggest that Falcone bought into rumors that Slim was behind the debt purchases well into 2013. ìIf I were a betting man, I would say that SoundPoint is Slim,î Falcone wrote in May 2013. ìI received a phone call today from the Salinas family Ö the arch enemy of Slim in Mexico,î the e-mail read.

227,"A pair of king-size mattress retailers are looking to make the springs squeak. Mattress Firm ó the No. 1 chain in the US, with more than 1,100 stores ó is in talks to acquire Sleep Train, which dominates California, The Post first reported Tuesday night on nypost.com. Houston-based Mattress Firm, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ìMFRM,î is looking to acquire privately held Sleep Train in an all-stock deal that could be worth upwards of $200 million, according to sources briefed on the situation. The negotiations are ongoing, and could still fall apart, sources cautioned. Mattress Firm hasnít yet finalized an offer for Sleep Train, according to a source. ìThereís no deal on the table,î Jennifer Ritchie, a spokeswoman for Sleep Train, said Tuesday, declining to comment further. Mattress Firm didnít respond to requests for comment. Nevertheless, insiders said Sleep Train, an employee-owned chain of more than 100 stores that ranks itself as the nationís fourth-largest, could hop into bed with Mattress Firm in the coming weeks. The roll-up would create the only specialty mattress retailer in the US with a coast-to-coast footprint, increasing its clout with the nationís dominant manufacturers, led by Tempur Sealy and Serta Simmons, insiders said. The merger would likewise solidify Mattress Firmís size advantage over Sleepyís, the Hicksville, NY, chain that dominates the Northeast. ìThis is going to turn up the pressure on Sleepyís to grow, and you could argue that they havenít been aggressive enough,î one industry insider said. Sleepyís didnít respond to a request for comment. With their fortunes closely tied to the sluggish US housing market, mattress retailers have been consolidating what has been a highly fragmented business in recent years. Indeed, Mattress Firm CEO Steve Stagner has added a few notches to his bed post of late, acquiring a pair of Midwest-based chains in November that operate 44 stores combined. In May 2012, Mattress Firm bought Mattress Giant, a rival with 180 stores in Texas and Florida. Even as he digests those deals, Stagner is investing aggressively in advertising and employees, a strategy that lately appears to be paying off. Last month, Mattress Firmís shares soared after it raised its financial forecast on a 46-percent profit surge. Sleepyís, a 55-year-old, family-owned company said to be the countryís No. 2 mattress retailer, currently operates more than 900 stores in 17 states up and down the East Coast from Maine to North Carolina. Compared with Mattress Firm, Sleepyís has focused on opening its own stores instead of acquiring smaller chains.

Martoma enrolled at Stanford in 2001, two years after being kicked out of Harvard for forging his transcript grades from Bís to Aís, in an apparent bid for a federal court clerkship. He graduated from Stanford in 2003. Stanford admissions forms require applicants to disclose disciplinary matters ó such as being expelled from Harvard, according to a report. Expulsion from Harvard would be a ìserious impedimentî to getting into the university, the report said, quoting a person familiar with Stanfordís admission process. Stanford would not say whether Martoma disclosed the matter on his application, the report, in the New York Times, said. Martoma, 39, on trial in Manhattan federal court for using illegal tips on drug trials to cobble together the most lucrative trade ever based on inside information, changed his name after he left Harvard, from Ajai Mathew Thomas to Mathew Martoma.

229,"Millions getting new debit, credit cards after Target hack. Millions of consumers are being sent new credit and debit cards in the wake of the recent security breach that hit as many as 110 million Target customers. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) announced Tuesday that it is replacing 2 million credit and debit cards due to the hack. Other major issuers haven't released the number of cards they're replacing, but did confirm they are sending new cards to certain customers. Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) both said they are reissuing cards that they believe are ""at risk of"" fraud, while American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) said it has replaced ""a small number"" of cards -- mostly at the request of customers. ""Card replacement is not something we typically do in large numbers, as we feel it can inconvenience customers,"" spokeswoman Marina Norville said. And it is an inconvenience, since it means updating your card information everywhere it is currently stored. But here are some tips to make the transition as painless as possible: Recurring payments. Even before getting your new card, take a look at your last couple of statements and make a list of any recurring payments that were made -- like utilities, gym memberships, student loans or cell phone bills. That way, you know what information you'll need to update when your card arrives. Otherwise, your next monthly transaction might be denied and you could end up being late on payments. Who hacked Target? Online shopping. Next, think about all of the places where your credit or debit card information may be stored online. That includes Amazon, Paypal, eBay, airline websites, daily deal sites like Groupon, and many others. Unlike recurring payments, this information doesn't have to be updated right away -- so it may be easier to update as you use each site. And if you used your card at Target between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, contact your issuer to request a new card immediately instead of waiting around wondering if a new one will arrive in the mail, advises John Ulzheimer, credit expert at CreditSesame.com. ""I would make the assumption your card is going to be reissued at some point and be proactive... [so] you're on your own timeline instead of the bank's timeline,"" he said. The good news. If you're getting a new debit card, don't worry about updating direct deposit information or requesting new checks. Only the debit card number should change when the card is reissued -- not your checking account number. And while transitioning to a new card is a hassle, at least you're not losing money -- and it's better than dealing with fraudulent charges on an account or getting your identity stolen. ""The good news is that you're not going to be liable for anything -- so it's an inconvenience but not a financial issue,"" said Ulzheimer.","Millions getting new debit and credit cards after Target hack - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/pf/new-cards-hack/index.html

Even allowing for the usual dose of Iranian bluster, these responses underscore the main weakness of the Obama approach: the president and secretary of state do not recognize whom they are dealing with. When Obama came to office, he thought the problem was Iranian anger at George W. Bush. What he hasnít grasped is that, to this regime, thereís not much difference between presidents. Thatís because its leaders rightly see America as the obstacle to their ambitions for the Middle East. The president says diplomacy will tame Iran.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Meet the CNNMoney Tech 30 : an index of the most important tech stocks. The goal of the Tech 30 is to give CNNMoney readers a daily look at how shares of the most influential technology companies are faring. The editors and writers of CNNMoney's technology team picked the 30 companies. To qualify, the stocks had to have shares publicly traded in the United States that are easy for the average investor to buy. (Sorry, Samsung!) The pure-tech focus differs from other tech stock barometers. The Nasdaq, for example, is often cited as a ""tech index"" but only 42% of the composite is made up of tech companies. The S&P 500 Information Technology index includes several stocks that aren't typically considered at the cutting edge of tech, such as MasterCard ( MA , Fortune 500 ) , money transfer service Western Union ( WU , Fortune 500 ) and consulting firm Accenture ( ACN ) . To track the performance of the Tech 30 index, we ""invested"" $1,000 in play money in each of the 30 stocks on January 2, 2014. So the baseline for the index is $30,000. The CNNMoney Tech 30 portfolio page displays values for both the index as a whole and the specific stocks. The graphic at the top of the page measures the stocks' performance relative to one another from the beginning of the year. The bubbles for the better-performing stocks will appear larger. We don't plan to make regular changes to the Tech 30. But if a current Tech 30 company is acquired or goes private, we'll replace it by ""investing"" in a different stock. We may also choose to add shares of newly public companies when appropriate. Twitter ( TWTR ) , for example, was not on our original list when we first started thinking about creating the index last summer. But we knew we had to add Twitter to the Tech 30 once it filed for its initial public offering.

233,"Itís one of the sad ironies of modern life that as marriage has grown more idealized, itís also becoming less common. The amount we spend on weddings has skyrocketed; American women are glued to shows about buying the perfect wedding dress, finding the most delicious food to serve at the reception and hiring the best band. Yet weíre less and less likely to actually tie the knot. Even when kids are involved: New data from the governmentís National Survey of Family Growth shows that 40 percent of all births during the 2000s were to unwed mothers. And that last isnít only due to the fact that we have stopped stigmatizing pre-marital sex and out-of-wedlock births: Itís also the way weíve started thinking of marriage as a consumer good, rather than a transcendental commitment that allows the couple to work at building a better, more meaningful life. Many now see marriage as a prize that you win for getting your life together. Interviews with American women reveal that they want to wait until they get an education, a decent job, good financial footing, even a downpayment on a home before theyíll take that next step of getting married. And who can blame them? If you donít have an extra few grand to spend to ìlook like a princessî on your ìbig dayî and ó if youíve watched a few episodes of ìSay Yes to the Dressî ó youíll conclude itís probably not worth it. Which is why the decline in marriage can be seen most dramatically among poor Americans. A 2010 Pew survey found that 64 percent of college-educated Amer≠icans get married, compared with only 48 percent of those with a high-school diploma or less. That gap quadrupled in the half century after 1960. Poor women still dream of the fairy-tale wedding, but few believe they can afford it. If youíll excuse a little cheesiness, though, marriage is supposed to be a journey, not a destination. Or rather, itís best thought of as a tool to help you on your journey. The data are clear on this point. Marriage has lots of benefits, but the easiest to measure are financial. All things being equal, itís much easier to make it on two incomes than one (or at least, if one spouse stays home with the kids, two workers). And the long-term commitment of marriage means that people are more likely to pool their resources and build a life together ó even if you got the ring from a Cracker Jack box and spoke your vows at City Hall. But like any tool, there is a correct way to use marriage. Which brings us to a recent study from the Council on Contemporary Families. The CCF researchers found that these financial benefits donít necessarily show when a single mother marries: ìWe found no physical or psychological advantages for the majority of adolescents born to a single mother whose mothers later married.î They did, however, find a ìmodest benefitî for the children whose mothers married the biological fathers. This is pretty logical. As Brad Wilcox of the National Marriage Project explains, the ìnew guy may not be particularly invested in a child who is not his.î A huge mound of studies support the idea that it is best for a child to be raised by two biological parents. And when that possibility isnít available, there is no clear advantage to having a stepfather over growing up with a single parent. The implications of the new CCF study and the other research seem clear enough: To get the benefits of marriage, you should marry first, then have children with the guy you marry. But such a conclusion is apparently too old-fashioned for the folks at CCF, who argue that the government should stop its encouragement of marriage as a way to get out of poverty. Kristi Williams, a sociologist at Ohio University and lead author of the study, says poverty is the reason people donít marry. And rationally so, she suggests: If youíre poor, she tells me, ìthe men available to you have low levels of education and few good economic prospects.î Then again, by that logic, why have a baby with such a guy?

To fix poverty, she suggests ìraising the minimum wageî and ìoffering more sex education and more access to birth control and family planning.î Letís leave aside whether those fixes are likely to change anything ó as well her suggestion that these women are too ignorant to know how not to get pregnant and that they canít afford (now free) birth-control pills.

234,"The chance he'll ever finish ""studying"" fracking: Gov. Cuomo's stalled on making a decision his entire time in office. Photo: AP. Blocking traffic on toll-plaza lanes of the George Washington Bridge for four days under cover of a bogus traffic study turned out to be a very bad idea. So why is it acceptable to block drilling across an entire state for three years under cover of a series of supposed studies? The ìtraffic studyî was actually about a political agenda of retribution ó engaged in, if not by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, then by aides who at the least thought they were serving their bossís interests. It all fell apart when subpoenaed e-mails removed all doubt that the traffic study was a sham and the payback the reality. Meanwhile, here in New York, we have the the long-delayed issuance of a purported scientific study on the safety of hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus shale, which geologically underpins much of Upstate. Thirty states and the federal Environmental Protection Agency have all deemed the practice, on balance, to be safe, and in particular to pose no significant threat to the drinking water supply. And New Yorkís own Department of Environmental Conservation also, by all accounts, produced its own study which would have green-lighted the process. Yet that was short-circuited by Gov. Cuomo, who abruptly referred the issue to Health Commissioner Dr. Nariv Shah last February, ordering Shah to conduct a study on the health effects of the drilling. The DEC study was two years in the making, and now the Health Department study has been almost a year in the making, with no firm date in sight for completion ó though Dr. Shah had initially said it would be done in ìweeks.î Asked more recently, however, he simply said something to the effect that good science takes time. Hmm. Does he need some more beakers or lab space or lab techs? What is going on here? Might someone be intentionally blocking ìtrafficî for some political end? No one (other than some thuggish Christie aides) had an interest in throwing Fort Lee into gridlock. By contrast, there is a well-organized and boisterous political opposition to fracking, with protestors vigorously dogging the governor in his upstate travels. It has become a flashpoint for controversy ó indeed, growing controversy, since the longer the decision is delayed, the more emotional the debate becomes, and the facts be damned. Yet the cost of this blockage is far greater than what Fort Lee suffered. Upward of 200,000 jobs could be created (many directly in fracking, more in related industries), substantially boosting Upstateís sagging economy. Billions of dollars in new tax revenue and other benefits, including reduced energy costs, hang in the balance. This wouldnít be the first time that Cuomo or his aides have weighed in to put their thumbs on the scales to affect a politically significant outcome (e.g., the mysterious rewriting of the language presenting the casino amendment on this past fallís ballot, which made the measure seem a winner for all). Might there be some bullying going on here (beyond the way fracking opponents have bullied the governor)? Who is holding back the state health chief from speedy completion of his appointed rounds? Has someone put traffic cones in the Health Departmentís lanes ó or has the department itself become one giant orange cone? To frack or not to frack is an important issue facing the governor of New York, yet one he didnít even mention in last weekís State of the State Address. The delay of such an important decision is unconscionable. Dr. Shah, may we please see your e-mails on this subject? Perhaps they might tell us whether your report is being held hostage, and if so, by whom. This is clearly a legitimate point of inquiry for the appropriate legislative committee. Do I hear subpoena, anyone?

235,"What a bizarre spectacle. Assuming he didnít lie during his marathon news conference last week, the feeding frenzy surrounding New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will be remembered as one of those incredibly odd moments of elite journalistic hysteria that are difficult to explain to people who werenít there or didnít get it. Iím not referring to the scandal itself; thatís easy enough to understand. What Christieís team did was outrageous and deserves as much foofaraw and brouhaha as the New Jersey media can muster. Whatís harder to grok is the hysteria at the national level. For starters, there have been countless greater outrages at the state level that have received far less national coverage. (Indeed, some national scandals under President Obama have gotten less intense national coverage.) Since 1961, four Illinois governors have ended up in jail, and with the exception of Rod Blagojevich, few received comparable media attention. ìMeet the Pressî dedicated 33 minutes to the New Jersey scandal, including a grilling of Reince Priebus, head of the Republican National Committee, as if Christie were President Richard Nixon during Watergate (a comparison ostensibly serious people have made). Many conservatives see liberal media bias in all this. But that diagnosis misses the fact that this was the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, giving producers ample opportunity to advance a liberal agenda. Moreover, Christie is actually quite popular in establishment media circles ó the sort of politician Sunday-show liberals insist America needs more of. Heís also quite unpopular in many quarters of the right. If there is a secret left-wing cabal interested solely in advancing the liberal cause through the media, the Christie auto-da-fÈ was a missed opportunity. A more plausible partial explanation is partisan bias, which can be hard to distinguish from liberal bias in many outlets since it tends to favor Democrats. The key difference is that partisan bias focuses more on the political interests of specific politicians or a party generally. Feeding-frenzy defenders insist the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge is special because innocent constituents were deliberately inconvenienced for partisan purposes. Thatís surely what makes this scandalous, but it hardly makes it unique. The Obama administration employed similar tactics during the sequester and the government shutdown. Closing the open-air World War II Memorial, furloughing air-traffic controllers and other efforts were deliberate attempts to maximize the pain of innocents for political benefit. The tactic worked, but thatís not a justification for it, is it? The allegation that the Obama administration used the IRS to target political opponents is far more explosive (similar tactics were at the core of the Nixon impeachment effort). And, unlike Christieís claims of what he knew and when, similar White House denials havenít held up. And in the same week the media succumbed to St. Vitusí dance over Christieís alleged ìcoverup,î it was revealed that the Justice Department had appointed an Obama donor from the Civil Rights Division, instead of the Public Integrity Division, to investigate the IRS scandal. The department now says it would be unlawful to remove her from the assignment because of her political views. Thatís untrue. Yet no hysteria there. Christie is widely seen as a threat to whoever the Democratic nominee will be. Unlike some recent GOP nominees, who struggled to be merely lifelike, Christie has an authenticity and charisma most national Republicans lack. As ABCís Jonathan Karl put it on ìThis Week,î Christie is ìthe most intriguing and colorful personî in American politics. That probably explains the overkill as much as anything. Christie is new, exciting and interesting in ways Obama once was. The difference is that when Obama was new and exciting, the media were biased in every regard and heroically skeptical of any Obama wrongdoing. ìWe thought he was going to be .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. the next messiah,î Barbara Walters recently said. The cult of personality has diminished but the partisan skepticism remains. Christie, like most Republicans, never benefited from such skepticism, and never will.",National hysteria over Bridgegate is overblown | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/the-press-goes-overboard-in-new-jersey/
236,"Does your doctor nag you about your drinking? The federal government wishes he would. Last week the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted with alarm that most Americans say they have never discussed alcohol consumption with a health professional. Physiciansí reluctance to broach the subject is especially troubling, the CDC said, because ìat least 38 million adults in the U.S. drink too much.î Most news outlets reported the latter claim as a fact, failing to notice the value judgments embedded in it. Contrary to what the CDC wants you to believe, the question of what it means to drink too much is a matter of moral and medical dispute. According to the CDC, ìproblem drinkersî consist mainly of ìbinge drinkers,î which does not mean what you might think: people who spend days in a drunken stupor, devoting themselves to intoxication in a way that seriously disrupts their lives. No, according to the CDC, a man is a binge drinker if at any point in the past month he has consumed five or more drinks ìon an occasionî; for a woman, the cutoff is four drinks. This definition is based on the amounts typically needed to reach a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent, which corresponds to the legal per se standard for driving while intoxicated (DWI). What if you do not plan to drive? It does not matter. The CDC has decreed that no one should ever drink this much, no matter the circumstances. Note that the CDCís definition of a binge is determined legally rather than scientifically. When the DWI standard was 0.10 percent, many of todayís binge drinkers would not have qualified as such. And if Congress lowers the cutoff to 0.05 percent, the number of binge drinkers will shoot up overnight. The governmentís notion of a binge encompasses patterns of consumption that do not cause measurable harm to anything except the CDCís sensibilities. If a man at a dinner party drinks a cocktail before the meal, a few glasses of wine during it and a little bourbon afterward, he is drinking too much, according to the CDC, even if he takes a cab home. Even if you never binge in this manner, that does not necessarily mean your drinking meets with the governmentís approval. The CDC also worries about men who have more than 14 drinks per week and women who have more than seven. If you are a woman, donít think you can get a pass by sticking to one drink every day but Saturday, when you have two. That puts you over the governmentís limit and makes you part of the problem. Unless you live in Canada, where 10 drinks a week is deemed OK for women; or the U.K., where women are safe if they do not ìregularlyî consume more than three ìunitsî (1.5 glasses of wine) a day; or Italy, where they are allotted up to 40 grams of ethanol (nearly three shots of vodka) each day. Evidently the CDCís rules are not as obviously correct as it pretends. The relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality (like the relationship between weight and mortality) follows a J-shaped curve, meaning that drinking more is associated with better health ó up to a point. Where is that point? Around two drinks a day for women and four for men, according to a 2006 analysis of 34 prospective studies published in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Thatís a lot more generous than the CDCís quotas. The CDC also goes beyond the scientific evidence in declaring that pregnant women and adults younger than 21 are drinking too much if they drink at all. There is no evidence that light to moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy harms fetuses, and the legal drinking age is an arbitrary limit questioned by many. In short, the CDCís pronouncements about drinking mix medicine with moralism in a way that may not be healthy. They should be consumed with caution.",Uncle Samís dubious drinking advice | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/uncle-sams-smarmy-drinking-advice/
237,"Military advocates are still outraged , because the vast majority of veterans will still lose some pension benefits. ""That's probably the most egregious part of a very egregious provision,"" said Army Col. Michael Barron, who retired four years ago, after 30 years of service. He was deployed to Iraq during both wars and also faces a cut. ""We want them to remove the entire provision, not just one teeny component of it,"" said Barron, who is also deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. Most military retirees are a lot younger than private sector retirees . They enlist in their 20's and retire in their 40's. Very few stay on until they reach 62 -- those who may be lucky enough to escape major injuries at war, or rose to higher echelons in the military system. When compounded, the 1 percentage point cut could result in much more than a 20% reduction in retiree pensions over 20 years. The average cut in pension payouts, including compounding interest, for a retiring Army Sergeant first class, would be about $3,700 each year, according to the Military Officers Association of America. Over 20 years, the total losses could balloon to more than $80,000. Military retirees continue to lobby hard to reinstate cost-of-living increases for all. They have the support of a key group of eight Senate Republicans. The lawmakers might be able to repeal the military cuts in exchange for a deal with Democrats on extending jobless benefits extended for the long-term unemployed .

238,"What music videos were to the MTV of yore, programs about single teen mothers are to the MTV of today ó a staple. The networkís franchise of reality shows about teenagers coping with out-of-wedlock-births, beginning with ì16 and Pregnantî and including the spinoffs ìTeen Momî and ìTeen Mom 2,î has been a runaway success. It has given us such teen moms as Jenelle Evans, who alleged that her drug-abusing boyfriend beat her up, causing her to have a miscarriage. And Amber Portwood, who got out of jail on parole last year after serving time for drug charges ó the latest in a string of troubles encompassing a suicide attempt and battery charges for allegedly beating up her boyfriend. And, of course, Farrah Abraham. If you donít know who Abraham is, you obviously havenít been keeping up with Us Weekly. She didnít tell her ex-boyfriend that he was the father before he was killed in a car accident. Her mother was charged with assault for hitting her. But never mind. Rocketed to D-list celebrity by her appearances on ì16 and Pregnantî and ìTeen Mom,î she got two breast augmentations, performed in a sex video and has now graduated to appearing on the VH1 show ìCouples Therapy.î In other words, she is living the American Dream of pointless notoriety. For understandable reasons, the MTV franchise has been lambasted by cultural conservatives for glamorizing the lives of young women who have made desperately poor choices. But along come a couple of economists with a new paper on the social effects of the MTV shows to tell us that that gets it all wrong: The programs actually led, by their calculations, to a nearly 6 percent reduction in the teen birthrate between June 2009 and the end of 2010. Their analysis of all the episodes of ì16 and Pregnantî finds 47 pregnancies, and only four marriages prior to birth. Almost all the fathers stay involved throughout the pregnancy, but by the end of the episodes, half the relationships are very strained or over. About a quarter of the births are by C-section, and the young mothers experience ìextensive sleep deprivation.î This is not ìLifestyles of the Rich and Famousî or ìThe Bachelorette.î ìOverall,î write the authors of the study, Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland and Phillip Levine of Wellesley College, ìthe realities of the lives of teen mothers are presented in ways that may have been unknown or difficult to imagine for other teens viewing the show.î According to their findings, getting a dose of the reality of teen child rearing ó which means limited educational prospects and a high likelihood of poverty ó changes the behavior of teens exposed to the shows. There are two things to say about this result. One is that it vindicates the common-sensical belief that pop culture has an impact on how we live. The entertainment industry celebrates itself as important and brave, but when anyone suggests that its stupid and degrading output might influence how anyone thinks or behaves, it retreats to the ìitís just a TV show or movieî defense. The other is that the trend toward ever-increasing out-of-wedlock child rearing neednít be accepted as inevitable. If MTV has inadvertently stumbled on a highly credible way to make the case to teens that the life of a single teen parent is to be avoided, then surely there are other effective ways to spread the word about the struggles inherent to out-of-wedlock child rearing more generally. (Teens under 18 account for less than 8 percent of all out-of-wedlock births.) As for MTV, it may create a mixed message. Another new study found that teenage viewers of the shows had unrealistically rosy views of single motherhood ó perhaps because after the travails depicted on ì16 and Pregnant,î a few high-profile teen moms like Farrah Abraham graduate to the tawdry satisfactions of minor celebrityhood.

239,"75 economists back minimum wage hike. A Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour got the backing Tuesday of 75 leading economists. The group includes seven Nobel laureates, among them Joseph Stiglitz and Peter Diamond, and several former Obama and Clinton administration economists. They lent their support to legislation known as the Fair Minimum Wage Act, introduced in the House by Rep. George Miller and in the Senate by Sen. Tom Harkin. ""The vast majority of employees who would benefit are adults in working families, disproportionately women, who work at least 20 hours a week and depend on these earnings to make ends meet,"" the group wrote in a letter to congressional leaders and to President Obama, who backs the Miller-Harkin proposal. The legislation would phase in the minimum wage increase from today's $7.25 an hour to $8.20 in the first year, then to $9.15 the year after and to $10.10 in the third year. Thereafter, it would be indexed to inflation. Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, noted Tuesday that the minimum wage is effectively lower on an inflation-adjusted basis than it was in 1950, when it was worth $7.28 in today's dollars. If the legislation passed, a full-time minimum wage worker would see a bump in pay from about $15,000 a year to roughly $21,000. That could put a family of three above the poverty line. Only about 1.6 million hourly workers currently earn the minimum wage, according the Congressional Research Service. But the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that organized release of the letter, estimates that another 17 million hourly workers who now earn between $7.25 and $10.10 an hour would see higher wages over the three years of a phased-in increase. And millions more who make above $10.10 would indirectly benefit if employers adjust pay scales commensurate with a minimum wage increase, EPI estimates. The Miller-Harkin proposal would also raise the hourly base for workers paid in tips. It would increase for one year to $3 from $2.13 currently. Then the proposal calls for the base to be adjusted annually so that it eventually matches 70% of the federal minimum wage. Reaching that 70% peg is expected to take about six years, after which it would be adjusted annually for inflation. The economists asserted in their letter that ""research suggests that [an increase] could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth."" Critics say a higher minimum wage will hurt jobs. Their argument: employers will hire fewer people or reduce their hours . And they may compensate for the extra expense in other ways that can hurt consumers, for instance by raising prices. Some studies show a negative effect on jobs. But others show a positive effect or no effect at all. In any case, political analysts don't think there's much chance for passage of a minimum wage hike this year. ""I just don't see it getting through the House,"" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for the Potomac Research Group. Wage wars: The fight for higher pay. But the idea is likely to feature prominently in stump speeches during this midterm election year. ""This is all about Democrats positioning to run in the elections on an inequality theme. Republicans are going to have a tough time responding, but I highly doubt the response will be to allow a minimum wage hike,"" said Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group. Rep. Miller and Sen. Harkin are more optimistic. Harkin said Tuesday the Senate may take up minimum wage legislation in a few weeks. If the first attempt fails, it won't be the only shot this year for Republicans who oppose the increase ""to change their mind."" States don't have to adopt the federal minimum wage, but in states where the minimum wage is different, ""the employee is entitled to the higher wage of the two,"" according to CRS.","Minimum wage hike gets boost by 75 economists - Jan. 14, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/14/news/economy/raising-minimum-wage/index.html
240,"Thatís been a top Team de Blasio goal since the new mayor was polling in the single digits and courting the teachersí union, and Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina on Monday telegraphed hints as to how the mission is to be accomplished. Speaking with National Public Radio, the career Board of Ed bureaucrat had this to say about a proposal to extract rent from charter schools that happen to occupy space in traditional public schools: ìI think that a lot of people make a lot of money on [charters]; if thereís money for some things, thereís got to be money for rent as well .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. I think right now we need space for our own kids. Youíre going to have a large pre-K initiative. Where are we going to put some of those kids?î This is an astonishing statement on a couple of levels, but first be clear on this fundamental point: New York Cityís seemingly endless charter-school debate has nothing to do with rental income ó or even money, except tactically. Intrinsically, it has very little to do with classroom space, either. Itís about the fact that most charter schools arenít unionized, and that more often than not they work ó embarrassing the unionists. This makes them an existential threat to the perceived best interests of the United Federation of Teachers, which involve the jobs, pay and perks of its members ó and never mind the kids. Now the union is calling the public-education shots, and it has decreed that the charter baby be drowned in the bathtub ó and, again, never mind the kids. In this respect, Farinaís NPR comments explain a lot. First off, her assertion that ìwe need space for our own kidsî borders on the bizarre. Forget space: New York Cityís 160 charter schools are every bit as much public institutions as the 1,400 other schools that have been placed in Farinaís custody. At least nominally. Charter kids are her kids, too. They are New Yorkís kids ó diverse, challenging, and also very much in need of a sophisticated, 21st-century education. But Farinaís distinction certainly tracks the UFT line ó and it also mirrors the view of anti-reform troglodytes like NYUís Diane Ravitch, a woman with substantial, if surreptitious, influence on the new administration. The comment also calls into question the chancellorís judgment, to say nothing of her independence ó and totally discounts the fact that charter schools work. Not all of them, of course, but most ó which is more than can be said for the system at large. No surprise here; certainly parents know it. Thatís why thousands of them turn out for charter-placement lotteries every year, fully understanding that theyíll mostly leave disappointed because the demand vastly exceeds the available number of seats. Build more seats? No way ó Albany saw to that when it wrote the stateís charter-school law, bowing to union pressure to deny charters capital construction money. The Bloomberg administrationís response was to shoehorn charters into existing school buildings. This quickly evolved into a continuing embarrassment to the UFT ó itís not easy to explain why your half of a building is failing while the charter half soars ó and, not surprisingly, Mayor de Blasio has promised to end the practice. Strike one. Meanwhile, Farinaís NPR interview dropped the other shoe on de Blasioís vaporous early-education scheme ó a campaign proposal so light on detail that its point seemed solely to have been its funding mechanism: a tax calculated to pummel rich people on behalf of ìthe children.î Now Farina may have revealed another purpose: a ploy to further tightens the screws on new charters in existing school buildings. To repeat for emphasis: ì[Weíre] going to have a large pre-K initiative,î she said Monday. ìWhere are we going to put some of those kids?î Where indeed. Strike two. Will there be a strike three? Well, de Blasio is not only pitching, heís also the ump. And the UFT is sitting up in the ownersí box. So how long before all of the Bloomberg-era reforms ó including mayoral control itself ó are sent to the showers? The reforms didnít all work. True progress is always slip and slide, with traction gained here and there until all of a sudden the movement is real and steady. Thatís where Mayor Mike left things, and thatís the standard against which his successor will be judged.

242,"As the expression goes, behind every great man who draws the attention of global†baseball fans, there is a petite Japanese pop star. The Yankeesí offseason agenda hinges on landing free-agent pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, whose exploits in Japan and major league-ready arsenal have teams lining up to lavish $100 million on the right-hander. Now meet his stunning wife, Mai Satoda, an entertainment idol who has appeared with several musical acts and on television variety shows in Japan. Tanaka, 25, and Satoda, 29, were married in late 2012. Her professional ambitions are a mystery factor in the already secretive Tanaka sweepstakes. A New York Times report Monday, recycling word out of Japan, stated Satodaís ìgoalî is to be on the West Coast , which would seem to favor the Dodgers, one of the consensus front-runners for Tanaka along with the Yankees. Here is a sample of Satodaís work. One of her biggest music singles was 2007's ìOyaji no Kokoro ni Tomotta Chiisa na Hiî: Working under the Hello! Project umbrella , Satoda is a past member of singing groups such as Country Mosume, Pabo and Ongaku Gatas, which brings us ìCome Togetherî: She also has been featured in several photobooks ó which is a book of photos ó and was a frequent guest on the elaborate quiz show, ìQuiz!

The Yankees are dead just like Steinbrenner†and Dodgers are the new Yankees these days. Wake up I don't doubt it that they go after Price as well. Hate to tell you, but the Yankees mystique is gone. The 90s are over. Players were willing to go the Yankees in the 90s because it was their best chance at a World Series ring. That is not the case anymore. So...if there are other outside factors, and the money is even close, it is entirely possible players will choose elsewhere. @ Lionel Dubinsky @ Ken Cuneo Stop smoking Lionel thats 300 million the Yankees nor the Dodgers will pay that much and you say that the Dodgers will offer twice as much. †Wow Tanaka will be a Dodger at about 120 million for 5 or 6 years. @ dynks @ Armand Berdynaj put the crack pipe down! †The Yanks were the first team to have their own station YES Network, just last year the other team in pro sports thought it was good idea. The Dodgers have not won since Michael Jackson was a black male and Reagan was President. how many months has it been since McCourt was filing bankruptcy? you can't spend like a drunken sailor with a new credit card. Nobody has more money than the Yankees. How can you say that and consider yourself credible? Dodgers almost went bankrupt a few years back remember? Just look at how much teams are worth, Yankees have more money than god. @ lakawak @ Armand Berdynaj I guess you can say the same thing about the Lakers. it is sad when the original owner dies then his kids can't have the same passion about winning. impossible to watch a Lakers game now and for the next decade? @ lakawak @ Armand Berdynaj The yankees will never have trouble attracting top free agents. Why are you looking at only the '90s ? They've been in the WS in every decade since the 1920's and won a title in all of them except the '80s. As one of the Cardinals said in an interview before the WS, just about every ML'er has thought about playing for the Yankees. You're forgetting the Yankees still have more money than the rest of the mlb teams combined. And Money is all that matters. You think the Yankees couldn't afford cano? They chose not to get stuck in another 10 year contract. If they want a player they will get him. @ Maria Sanskrit Sorry Maria but the Yankees don't have the most money in baseball they are worth the most money in baseball. BUT there a few owners that have more money than what the Yankees are worth. Yankees are worth about 2.3 billion. Howard Lincoln owner or the Mariners is worth 4.5 billion. @ CS yankees are worth at least on paper according to some magazine or other at least 1 billion dollars .. im sure they ahve enough credit from lenders to borrow if they need to sign a few players wether tenaka is worth the $$ or not is immaterial is ""anyone worth"" many millions of dollars a year to play a game we used to play as kids for free. Mariners DO NOT have more money than the yankees. They only got cano because they offered more years. The yankees offered him a higher AAV. Before you talk about teams having more money than the yankees do your research. No one has more than them. this so-called fan must be like 21 years old, †but I've been watching baseball since before he was swimming in his daddy's nuts. he has no concept of history and probably thinks the Beatles were just insects. @ Platerpus7 As a 50+ year Yankee fan I wish this was true. I'm thinking Tanaka signs with a West coast team probably the Dodgers.

243,"Cruise-goers are no strangers to beachy St. Thomasís Carnival. Photo: U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Tourism. Maybe itís just my gaping head wound talking ó day-drinking light and dark rum + stairs = trouble, kids! ó but Carnival in cheery St. Thomas, the when-in-Rome excuse I had to get my sugarcaned sottishness on, is hands-down (in front of the toilet, likely) the best in the Caribbean for beginners. And thatís saying something, considering thereís no shortage of Carnivals to choose from in the íhood. Each island hosts some form of it (usually lasting a a few days to a week, at least, if not a whole dang month), and theyíre all staggered throughout the year, so just about every calendar week you can find some costumed, parading psychopathy, somewhere. Montserrat and St. Kitts wrapped their Christmas/New Years tie-ins just last week. Haitiís is a more proper Mardi Gras tailgating affair, running the opening week of March. St. Maarten, like St. Thomas, doesnít get down until April through early May. While others prefer their bacchanalian hangovers in the summer, like Grenadaís ìSpice Masî and Barbadosí ìCrop Overî June-barreling-into-August extended plays. Seems the Carnival everybody always wants to talk about, however, is Trinidad and Tobagoís notoriously naked, nutso affair (youíll have to wait till March to indulge). Makes sense theirs should be the wildest of the bunch, given theyíre the Caribbean country nearest Brazil ó the crazy has rubbed off, for sure. But good old no-passport-requiring St. Thomas, being a United States Virgin Islander and all, has a mellower, considerably more laid-back take on things. Warning: Laid-back isnít at all code for straight-edge, by any means ó this is the homeland of Kelsey Grammer, dontcha know! The Caribbean Ritual Dancers troupe. Photo: Margot Jordan. Now in its 62nd annual go-round, running April 5 through May 3., St. Tommyís Carnival kicks off with calypso competitions and a steel band jamboree, and ends with its headliner, the adultís parade (thereís a cuter kiddie one the day before) in the USVI capital of Charlotte Amalie, right in the center of the islandís southern coast. It starts at the Western Cemetery, works its way down Main Street, and ends at Lionel Roberts Stadium. Costumes are typically some combination of feathers, sequins and (mostly) skin; troupe sizes range from a few dozen people, to hundreds. Along the route, spectators ó and there are thousands ó set up folding chairs and park it on either side of the road to watch for hours and hours Ö and hours (last yearís parade was delayed by rain and ran well into the night). Also along the 1Ω -mile path, some entrepreneurial residents repurpose their houses as pop-up mini-marts. Need some BBQ wings and a Red Bull? Come on in and help yourself, friend ó after you hand over a few bucks, thank you kindly. But first, thereís Jíouvert, the pre-party party that goes down two days before the adult parade, where damn near the entire island parades in Charlotte Amalie at sunrise (it used to start even earlier, at 4 a.m., but itís since been pushed back for security reasons) from Addelita Cancryn Junior High School, winding through Veterans Drive and down the waterfront. During Trinidadís Jíouvert (so Iíve been told by a hardcore vet), random people will just approach you, cover you in mud, paint and/or baby powder, then slap you in the face ó closed fisted if theyíre especially festive. Fun as that sounds, maybe skip that one for now if youíre a noob ó baby steps. But alternatively, for St. Thomasí Jíouvert, party people just like to play really good, really loud live music on slow-moving, giant open-air trucks, and wear ridiculous outfits (psychedelic ó as if thereís any other kind ó smurfs, check; naked-save-for-the-suspenders Super Mario Bros., you better believe it). You come for the calypso, but you stay for the homemade word tees ó some favorites this past year: ìIím not a gynecologist, but Iíll take a lookî; ìDonít bite the d*** that feeds youî; and the very straight-to-the-point gem some 300-pound gentleman was sporting read, ìDonít ask me for s***!î on the front ó and back, to drive his point home. Unfortunately, this past yearís Jíouvert saw a bit of unpleasantness in the form of a triple shooting (no worries, no one died). Turns out I was 10 feet away from it at the time, but was completely unaware of it because the music was so loud. I didnít even notice people around me were running away. Ace reporter = this guy! Caribbean revelers abound. Photo: Margot Jordan. After that, though, it was all peace and love, peace and love. I walked in the adultís parade dressed like an Arab pirate of some sort ó I think? ó in the Caribbean Ritual Dancers troupe. I started the day sober in a vest and a skort, toting a plastic sword. I ended the day vestless, skortless and swordless ó just barely in my T-shirt and shorts ó with a double-digit BAC, a dazed smile on my face and four staples in my forehead courtesy of the local ER. Somewhere in between I dirty-danced with belly-dancing Arab princesses (brilliantly choreographed by troupe leader, Diane) and barflyed heavily at our float/schizo-flavored Cruzan rum dispensary on wheels. Oh, the fuzzy maybe-true, maybe-not memories. We must have done something right, because our group won for best troupe under 50 people ó I like to think my wandering off and getting lost half-way in probably helped the most. The North Pull. Tragically, itís still a few months till St. Thomasí Carnival ó but that hardly means you have to hole up in your hotel room, clock-a-watchiní and thumb-a-twiddliní. Hereís how to get out of the capital and enjoy the northerly side of St. Thomas while you wait. Picnic bask it ó Grab an amply-hot-sauced burger or jerk fill-in-the-blank (chicken, pork, even fish, weirdly enough) at Gladyís Cafe in Charlotte Amelie, then drive on over to Magens Bay beach, directly opposite the capital on the north side, to scarf it down. It costs a few bucks to use the beach, which goes toward keeping a lively lifeguard on call, on-site toilets clean and the sand litter-free. Thereís a bustling beach bar, too ó try the rum shake: it brings all the boys and girls to the yard. High, there ó The greatest views on the island can be had for free atop St. Peter Mountain ó at 1,500 feet up, you can spy 20 different islands spying right back atcha. The catch?

244,"SU, ME: Su is chef at the Langham offering dumpling classes the author took with deformed but tasty results. Photo: Max Gross. ìIt takes about four or five years to become an expert.î So pronounced Phillip Ye, dumpling maven at the Langham Xintiandi Shanghai Hotel, who rolls dough and grinds pork every day to make xiaolongbao, the soup dumpling that Shanghai is famous for. Heís telling this to a group of bumbling amateurs in the kitchen of the Langham. (Reporters.) And, no, we donít have four or five years. More like 45 minutes. With Ye is Tony Su, the chef at Tang Court, Langhamís fancy, Shanghai/Cantonese restaurant. ìItís the same process as learning to write,î Su adds. (Both spoke through a translator.) ìYou start up and with patience you get better. When making the dough, if itís not refined enough it shows up when you eat it.î The dough is nothing more than water, flour and salt. It is rolled into a long thin log and cut into gnocchi-sized globs which are pressed into flat circles. Creating the dumplings. Photo: Max Gross. Each circle is then filled with minced pork and folded up into a little ball. ìBut wait!î you say. ìWhere does the soup come in?î The soup is already in the minced meat. The soup stock ó cooked for hours before considered acceptable ó is mixed with minced pork and turned into a paste. When it gets hot, the liquid separates from the meat. The Langham Xintiandi Shanghai ( xintiandi.langhamhotels.com , 99 Madong Road) has offered this course to corporate clients during the three years theyíve been open. But as Langham looks to offer more leisure options, theyíre also providing it to guests. (Classes can be arranged for $58 per hour per person but different rates apply to groups ó visitors should contact the hotel.) It would be an understatement to say we are not as successful as Ye. Our dumplings look like bulbous white onions with a stalk of pork shooting out of their heads. ìTheyíre rustic,î one colleague happily pronounces of these ugly dumplings. At least when these deformities come out of the steamer eight minutes later they taste good. Even if you donít take Langhamís crash course, thereís no way that you can set foot in Shanghai and not experience xiaolongbao bliss. Just a block or so away from the Langham is Din Tai Fung (123 Xing Ye Road) which serves fancier soup dumplings than most are prepared for: some have black truffle in them. How to eat your dumplings. Photo: Max Gross. Offered with each menu is a handy (and illustrated) guide to consuming the soup dumpling: Step one: dip it in vinegar and ginger. Step two: poke a hole through it with a chopstick. Step three: allow the soup to drain into your spoon. (Personally, I prefer to suck the soup directly out of the dumpling.) The chicken or the pork dumplings with truffles might distract from the rest of the menu, but one shouldnít skip items like spicy miso sauced noodles and fried pork chop with rice. A more traditional and downscale dumping experience is Lin Long Fang (10 Jiang Guo St.). The room is not much to look at: white walls, long wooden tables, stools to sit on. Near the doorway is the, uh, open kitchen ó which is four women covered in flour who are patiently rolling dough into xiaolongbao. But this only adds to the experience when they unceremoniously place bamboo steamers of pork, crab, and egg and pork (my favorite) in front of you. Almost as good as the dumplings are the other noodle dishes. The beef noodle soup comes with ground beef on top as tender and rich as a Bolognese sauce ó minus the cream. (When the bill was tallied for 12 people it came to $40, with lots of leftovers.) For those looking for novelty, Nan Xiang Xiaolong Mantou (85 Yu Yuan Road) offers dumplings so oversized that the soup must be sucked out through a straw. (A Shanghai friend, however, advises just sticking with their normal xiaolongbao.) Of course, not everybody likes their dumplings steamed. Just a block or so from the Peopleís Square is Yangís Dumpling (97 Huang He Road), which offers its big glutinous balls of dough, meat and soup oily and crispy. Four come in an order for 6 yuan (about $1). Yangís is on Huang He Road, a food heavy side street near the Shanghai Museum (which looks like a bamboo steamer!). And if youíre into the fried stuff, should you pass the venders frying scallion pancakes do not deny yourself. At about 50 cents, it is the cheapest scallion pancake youíll ever have ó and the best. Even the most determined noodle nuts out there canít live by xiaolongbao alone ó but after eating dozens over the course of a few days, one certainly feels like one might die from them.",Mastering the art of soup dumplings in Shanghai | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/13/dough-nuts-for-dumplings-in-shanghai/
245,"Couple with pensions plays too safe to win. On a roll: Adjusting investments will keep the Fraziers on the road to success. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) Dave and Kathy Frazier are among the dwindling number of Americans eligible for generous pensions in their fifties. Dave, 42, a major serving full-time in the U.S. Army Reserve, could retire now and receive more than 50% of his base pay. Kathy, a 41-year-old kindergarten teacher, stands to receive 75% of her income if she continues to work in Missouri public schools until age 54. While they're in good shape financially, the Fraziers also have ambitious goals. ""We want to pay off our house, put the kids through college, and still be able to retire at age 55, maybe in South Florida,"" says Dave. What Dave will do before then is unclear. He'd like to stay in the Army at least a few more years. He's also thinking about a second career, perhaps studying to become a financial planner. The most intimidating task on the horizon, though, is financing college for the couple's children, Austin, 10, and Emily, 8. ""When a 10-year-old is already asking me, 'Dad, how much does it cost to go to MIT?' you go, 'Oh, brother,' "" says Dave. Justifiably so, since the annual increase in the cost of private college has outstripped the inflation rate for years. Can the Fraziers pay for school and still retire early? Yes, says John Gajkowski, a financial planner in Oak Brook, Ill., if they get more aggressive about saving and investing. THE ADVICE. Fix the IRAs. Dave and Kathy's IRAs represent the bulk of their non-pension retirement resources, but the accounts aren't in good shape. They have an unwieldy 20 funds in each IRA, making it hard to see the big picture of their holdings. The real problem, though, is a too-timid asset mix: Nearly a quarter of their IRAs are in cash, earning next to nothing. The Fraziers already have $50,000 sitting in the bank, but that feels insufficient to Dave, who includes being able to get to their money ""fast, if we have an emergency"" in his investment philosophy. Gajkowski advises the Fraziers to put 32% of their portfolio in foreign stocks, up from 12%. A stake of that size -- which would amount to 45% of the Fraziers' stocks -- is higher than what most planners would recommend, but Gajkowski says the growing middle class in developing countries, along with mid-term growth prospects for overseas economies, will make international investments a good choice. How to save for retirement in 2014. He also tells the couple they can easily reduce the 1.7% they pay annually in management fees by moving most of their portfolio to ETFs. For now, Gajkowski suggests the Fraziers keep 10% of their portfolio in cash, primarily so they can take their time in deciding how to venture more fully into the stock and bond markets. Load up for college. The Fraziers have a GI Bill tuition benefit they can use, and they've periodically contributed to the kids' 529 accounts. Even so, Gajkowski thinks the family should earmark most of their $2,000 monthly surplus -- what's left after bills and retirement savings -- for college. Assuming 7% average annual returns, they'll have about $300,000 by the time Austin heads to school. Say no to real estate. Before meeting with Gajkowski, the Fraziers had considered using their monthly leftover cash to pay off their $150,000 mortgage early or buy a rental property in Florida that they might later occupy themselves. The planner doesn't like either idea. The couple have a low 4% rate and are on track to pay off the loan soon after retiring. As for Florida, Gajkowski says the difficulties of being out-of-state landlords aren't worth the possible economic payoff.","Couple with pensions plays too safe to win - Jan. 9, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/09/retirement/investing-portfolio.moneymag/index.html
246,"ìBikini body at 62!î screams this weekís headline on the new gossip magazine Closer. Cover girl Jane Seymour sports a pink two-piece and a stunningly perfect set of abs, looking ever so reminiscent of her Bond-girl self of 40 years ago. The ìbikini body,î one of the most odious terms ever coined, has become an all-pervasive measure of womenís aesthetic worth. The bikini itself ó once a fun, racy icon of the sexual revolution ó has become the exacting standard by which all physical assets and shortcomings may be publicly sized up. Being sexy in your 60s isnít a bad thing; as life expectancies go up and Helen Mirren shows no signs of being less foxy, our standards on age are evolving. But a shout-out for a bikini body should not be confused with genuine sexiness. The real irony of a bikini body ó on anyone older than about 17 ó is how deeply it contradicts its sunny, beachy surroundings. The owner of said body has almost certainly worked her butt off for such seemingly lighthearted photo-readiness. Much exercising and little ingestion of anything containing fat, sugar or any other consumable joy has occurred. As Seymour herself puts it in the Closer feature, ìI hate to deny myself things. If I have pasta, Iíll just eat half of it.î No disrespect to Jane ó she looks great in the suit, and if she only wants half, fine ó but, Jesus, the woman should be able to enjoy a whole plate of food. Pasta is sexy (just ask Sophia Loren). Being hungry and cranky and weight-obsessed is less so. Dame Helen Mirren Photo: AP. The tyranny of the bikini body runs far and wide. Are you a celebrity who just had a baby? Better have your bikini body ready to rock in mere months, or prepare to be fat-shamed. Kim Kardashian was pronounced a success of a person last month by US Weekly: ìSix months after giving birth to daughter North West, the 33-year-old reality star is proudly showing off her post-baby body in a skimpy bikini. Strutting confidently along the beach, the blonde stunner flaunted her slimmed-down figure and famous curves in a revealing white triangle top and matching side-tie bottoms. Itís a big milestone for the star.î In what way, for any reasonable person, is this a big milestone? (I know, weíre talking about Kim Kardashian, but still.) This is a milestone only in the universe of a ìCathyî comic strip. (ìAck! Itís nearly bathing suit season! I must strut confidently along the beach in a revealing white triangle top!î) In any case, that shoot was eventually revealed ó by The Post ó to have been enhanced with Photoshop. Because even when you are a real-life cartoon character like Kim, itís completely unrealistic to have a flawless body that quickly after having a child. Iím reminded of the credo of British journalist Caitlin Moran regarding any blatant gender divide: ìYou can tell whether some misogynistic societal pressure is being exerted on women,î she writes, ìby calmly enquiring, ëAnd are the men doing this, as well?í If they arenít, chances are youíre dealing with what we strident feminists refer to as ësome total f<U+200A>-<U+200A>-<U+200A>-ing bulls<U+200A>-<U+200A>-<U+200A>t.í<U+2009>î Sure, a guy will occasionally get accolades for his shirtless physique (hi, Joe Manganiello!), but thereís nowhere near the level of scrutiny that female celebs regularly endure. A man with a beer belly is par for the course; a woman with one is a national travesty. In this new year, letís jettison ìbikini bodyî for something a little more forgiving: the maillot body, perhaps? Or the wetsuit body. It is hard not to look like a badass in a wetsuit. Perhaps the edgiest ideal, though, comes from the nudists (or naturists, as they diplomatically call themselves). A clothing-optional beach is where youíll find a crowd truly comfortable with letting it all hang out. Maybe if we lost the tiny cloth triangles, weíd gain a little perspective. Kim has had a lot of help, and she wouldn't have been so insecure about the ""haters"" if she had worn appropriate clothing during her pregnancy.† She made the worst choices, tucked in shirts, pencil skirts, Gladiator lace up shoes... that couldn't help but raise the ridicule of her public.† Had she done anything tasteful, I doubt there would have been as much criticism. never knew Jane Seymour was so insecure. also, when they show us the actual unretouched photo of her on the beach instead of the one on the mag cover which i'm sure looks nothing like her real 62 year old body? then we'll talk. Too many overweight people who are catered to with a culture that says overweight is okay.† We are paying an enormous health care premium for overweight men and women. I saw a family of three - old, middle age and young - driving scooters together because they were too heavy to walk a store..† I have no problem with aging gracefully - but too much people who have turned into slobs.† I have sympathy for the genetically obese person - other than that people eat too much and have unhealthy life styles. Sara, why do you assume that she wants an entire plate of pasta? Maybe she enjoys having only half a plate of pasta which in turn helps her to remain physically fit, attractive to the opposite sex, healthy, etc etc. That combination may in fact keep her from being cranky, not make her cranky. So tired of the excuses for people being unfit and unhealthy. Get into shape. Eat a half a plate of pasta. Hit the gym. Be healthy. And, no, flabby, fat or any or word used to describe it is not healthy. Stop being so jealous, eat smaller portions, hit the gym and stop being so cranky yourself when you write about women about whom you are obvious jealous. No one wants stick bodied 60 year olds. How about those over 60 who are simply fit? Oprah decided it was OK for women to flounce around in skimpy outfits with back boobs and massive muffintops. Someone needs to tell these folks that if your morbidly obese you need to do something now! ugh really. why is it so wrong to look good at 60. i think we should celebrate healthy living. instead you are trying to make this into a gender issue men can be fat but women can't. oh cmon, this is 2014 women want their men to look healthy too, and yes even at 60. Most of the fad diets that people use to try to get a ""beach body"" are unhealthy, sometimes even dangerous - and let's not forget about the growing number of eating disorders. On the other side of the spectrum, having unrealistic standards means that a lot of people figure that fitness is something for other people, and they don't even try to be healthy. A lot of people get the worst of both worlds; they forget about their health all winter, then they starve themselves to get their ""beach body"" back. Fitness needs to be about health, it needs to be accessible to everyone, and it needs to be about finding things (ideally, things you enjoy) that you can do on a consistent basis all year long. Otherwise, our collective health is just going to get worse. It's just the opposite. While we've gotten fatter, the ideal body has gotten thinner (even Marilyn Monroe was chunky by today's standards). The current ideal body is only physically achievable by 12 percent of women. What that means is a lot of people just keep yo-yo-ing (making a little progress, then getting frustrated and losing ground again), while others just give up entirely. The focus needs to be on implementing a healthy lifestyle, not on achieving a figure that, for most people, is physically impossible. I agree wholeheartedly. The bikini began as a racy symbol of rebellion, and now it may as well be a corset.The more female flesh is exposed, the more flaws become apparent the more women spend their lives in perpetual diet mode. Chunky women are always judged in a way that beer gutted men will never be. I'm sure anorexia and bulimia were unheard of in 1922, when the first Ms America pageant was held. On the contrary, the winner would probably be considered a ""hambeast"" by the sensitive guys who posted here, who obviously must have washboard abs. If I never see another fluffy ""bikini body"" article in a women's rag it will be too soon. @Nbefor Belair†Along those lines, I don't remember women OR men of my parents (I grew up in the 60's and 70's) being obese. None. These days, if you even go into a high school, obesity is the norm. As to glorifying ""bikini bodies"", this and other newspapers put a lot of overhyped idiots pictures up who really shouldn't put on a bikini - Attention whooor Kim K. with her two zip code butt and shapeless calves being one of them. Pfft... @ Mathews Now that we pay for everyone through Obamacare, they feel like they have even less need to get into shape. They can be fat and have all of the problems that go along with it and someone else now has to pick up the tab. Conversely, as we're now paying for everyone's health, I feel like we have a right to tell people to drop the weight, eat better, stop smoking and so forth.",Itís time to be done with ëbikini bodyí tyranny | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/03/dont-let-jane-seymour-at-62-sway-you-time-to-be-done-with-bikini-body-tyranny/
247,"One night in 1986, Screw magazine publisher Al Goldstein, who died Thursday at 77, condemned me to death on his ìMidnight Blueî cable TV porn show ó not once, but four times. ìJust die, Steve . . . die, die, die,î he implored as a dominatrix took a whip to a copy of the New York Post nailed to a pole. Iím sure that somewhere, Al is still hoping and praying for my demise.

Many today fondly recall them as colorful expressions of New York ìgrit.î But Screw and ìMidnight Blueî truly expressed the cityís economic and social tailspin of the 1970s and í80s. Their capital zone was then-squalid Times Square, shown in all its lurid, neon-lit depravity in the cable TV showís opening. Goldstein was detested by business partners, five ex-wives and innumerable ex-friends. He was repeatedly sued, arrested and jailed. But the flesh trade made him for a time very rich, and thanks to clever lawyers whom he later stiffed, the penalties rarely stuck. Even many who once recognized him as a smiling, sinister accessory to human trafficking later came to view him as a sympathetic, cuddly New York character. Home video crippled his porn enterprises and the Internet finished them off for good in the í90s, leaving him bankrupt and homeless. Who could hate even a scoundrel like Goldstein, reduced to working as a greeter at the Second Avenue Deli?

248,"Now that the White House is accusing some Senate Democrats of wanting war with Iran instead of peace, it is tempting to welcome those Dems to the Abused-by-Obama Club. They are getting the ìenemiesî treatment the president routinely dishes out to Republicans, journalists and anyone else who fails to see Dear Leaderís absolute brilliance. But the moment passes and the temptation to sympathize is resisted. Having helped to create the Obama juggernaut and joined in the shaming of all who dared to resist for the last five years, the wayward Dems deserve a dose of their own medicine. They were worse than silent when Obama smeared others. They were full participants in the my-way-or-the-highway presidency that has polarized Washington and the nation. They passed the incomprehensible ObamaCare legislation without a single GOP vote. They never condemned Obamaís lie that people could keep their health plans and doctors. They approved the nearly trillion- dollar ìstimulusî that stimulated only the national debt clock. They were silent when four Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Libya and the administration concocted a lie to cover it up. They did nothing but cheer as the IRS went after conservative groups. They raised their hands in support of every tax hike, bailout and regulation the administration wanted. They watched without protest as millions of Americans went from work to unemployment to disability. They fought harder for food stamps than jobs. They saluted as Obama usurped congressional power by amending, waiving and delaying any provision of any law that was politically inconvenient. They changed the Senate rules to limit dissent. Presidents managed to govern with the filibuster rule for generations, but Barack Obamaís agenda was too pure for the traditions of bipartisan consensus, so the 60-vote rule was scrapped. Against that backdrop, the Democratsí revolt over Iran is the revolt of puppets against their master. It has the same chance of success and for the same reason: a lack of backbone. Donít get me wrong. In theory, adding more sanctions if the nuclear agreement collapses could be an incentive for Iran to live up to the deal. Unfortunately, the legislation is too little and too late to make a difference. The Iran train left the station a long time ago. Thatís because, despite his vow to prevent an Iranian nuke, Obama effectively has settled on a policy of containment. You donít need to hear the celebrating in Tehran to know that the agreement cements the mullahsí nuclear program, and makes America and the other Security Council members partners to it. An Israeli military strike is now next to impossible. Moreover, a new Iranian trade deal with Russia and plans for a French business delegation to visit Tehran are the death knell for existing sanctions. Before our eyes, the final obstacles are being cleared away for Iran to join the nuclear club. Obama, of course, doesnít have to decency to admit that truth. Instead, he sends out his goon squad, and has an aide say that any sanctions bill amounts to a ìmarch to warî and that those who support it favor military action. Naturally, too, the president paints himself as the smartest man in the room and the only good one. ìMy preference is for peace and diplomacy,î he said, a clear suggestion that his critics prefer war. Smears donít get any more odious. With Republicans in both houses ready to approve additional sanctions by a large margin, reports suggest that enough Senate Democrats are ready to break with the president to make a veto-proof majority. It wonít happen. The fever will pass, the intimidation will work and the Dems will fall back in line. Their next sound will be a squeal as they feign shock and outrage when Iran approaches the ìbreakoutî stage, where a nuke is a mere turn of the screw away. That moment will be a game changer in the Mideast, and potentially in the world. Chalk it up to another part of the Obama legacy, and to the Democrats who put their loyalty to party above their duty to America. Cop foes go for ëbrokeí That didnít take long. Mayor de<U+2009>Blasio is getting his first test on his policing policies. It comes from far-left groups determined to bend the NYPD in their direction. Their aim seems to be to stop police from enforcing the laws. Period. The challenge started when new top cop Bill Bratton, who said he supports the broken-windows theory of policing, announced plans to hire George Kelling, who developed the theory. Kelling, of the Manhattan Institute and Rutgers University, argued persuasively a generation ago that inattention to small crimes and quality-of-life offenses leads to more and bigger crimes. Bratton, working under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, became devoted to the idea, and it has been a mainstay of New York policing since. Yet capitalnewyork.com reports that Brattonís plan is ruffling the feathers of the New York Civil Liberties Union and similar groups. They gave Bratton a 10-page document outlining their demands that the department reduce the number of arrests for low-level crimes like trespassing and disorderly conduct. One critic, Alyssa Aguilera, the political director for VOCAL-NY, told the Web site, ìThe tenuous logic linking crime prevention and broken windows policing tactics, more accurately described as zero-tolerance policing, is both misaligned with the reality in New York City today and incredibly biased against low-income communities of color.î Here we go, and donít say you werenít warned. This is the result of de Blasioís rancid campaign against the cops. We will know soon whether he defends Bratton or those who favor anything-goes on the streets. Horse sense is lacking. A friend is confounded by Mayor de Blasioís determination to do away with the iconic horse-drawn carriages because, the mayor insists, the business is cruel to the horses. ìWhat am I missing?,î she writes. ìThe horses and their drivers are governed by 140+ pages of regulations and have had three accidents in the last 30 years. Meanwhile, bike lanes block snow plows, ambulances, truck deliveries, serve less than .01% of the population and a microscopic slice of the 55 million tourists. They have accidents daily, and the bike lanes cost millions to create and maintain. And the mayor is focused on horses?î Her confusion recalls a great Mark Twain line. In ìFollowing the Equator,î Twain visits India and concludes its inhabitants are ìa curious people. With them, all life seems to be sacred except human life.î By Twainís standards, New York is going backwards. Talk about a fowl bawl!

249,"Before ìGood Morning Americaíí host Robin Robertsí announced that she loves a lady ó a move applauded as gutsy and brave by folks who dominate the homosexual industrial complex ó another even gutsier and braver sexual true confession was made by a man. Only his declaration of alternative lust was greeted with derision by many in the same-sex pool. In a video he posted on YouTube last month, British Olympic bronze-medal diver Tom Daley, 19, who stars in Britainís celeb reality competitive diving show, ìSplash!íí announced he is intimately involved with a guy. The object of his affection was revealed to be screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, an American who won an Oscar for the 2008 gay-themed flick ìMilk.íí At 39, heís more than twice Daleyís age. ìAnd I couldnít be happier,íí Daley gushed. But the buzz was killed the moment he added six little words to his spiel: ìOf course, I still fancy girls.íí Shocker! It was clear that the young man in Speedos wasnít signing up for participation in one of the favored categories of the LGBT and sometimes ìQíí canon ó Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Questioning. (Or the formerly pejorative, now politically correct term, ìQueer.íí) Though he never used the word, Daley was applying for membership in the risky ìBíí column: ìBisexual.íí Reaction on social media was swift. Celebs from pop singer Lady Gaga to British actor Russell Brand tweeted words of encouragement. But homophobes and gay men were more cutting. ìWhatís the big deal?íí wrote one of the tamer online posters. ìHe never even said he was gay.íí Gay conservative pundit Andrew Sullivan suggested in his blog, The Dish, that Daley is just a gay man in training. Daleyís claim that he still fancies girls ìis a classic bridging mechanism to ease the transition to his real sexual identity,íí which is homosexual. ìI know because I did it, too.íí In a piece replete with same-sex stereotypes, The New York Timesí Michael Schulman this month advanced the theory that male bisexuality remains taboo, while lesbian action is enjoyed and encouraged by slobbering heterosexual males. ì(That straight men may find it titillating doesnít hurt.),íí Schulman wrote in parentheses. By that logic, heterosexual guys get kicks from bisexual girl action, such as Katy Perry singing ìI Kissed a Girl.íí But guys really went over the moon when Madonna and Britney Spears locked lips onstage at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards show, as well as when celeb train wreck Lindsay Lohan dated DJ Samantha Ronson. The new Netflix TV show ìOrange is the New Blackíí centers on an imprisoned bisexual woman who dates a man. Still, I doubt Mayor de Blasioís wife, Chirlane McCray, was thinking of males when she penned her 1979 Essence magazine essay, ìI Am a Lesbian.íí Just last week, in a pretty display of too much information and saliva, actress Michelle Rodriguez shared a sloppy kiss in Madison Square Garden with sultry British model/actress Cara Delevingne. No one seemed to mind. ìWe may have relaxed about out-and-proud gay men, but guys who admit to a dabble still face the questioning stares and whispers of ëIs he gay, straight or lying?í<U+2009>íí Patrick McAleenan, who is gay, wrote in Britainís The Telegraph. Nonsense! cried Williamson Henderson, who founded the STONEWALL Rebellion Veterans Association, whose members launched the gay-rights movement in 1969. ìI believe that every guy has it in himíí to be bisexual, said Henderson, who lives with a man who fathered two children by two women during their 10-year union. ìIt doesnít bother me at all. If he went with a male, thereíd be a problem.íí A gay pal told me he has bisexual friends ó male and female. ìFor some, yes, itís a bridge as they slowly or reluctantly come out as gay, but for others itís who they are,íí he said. ìItís all about whom you love.íí Who would believe that in these liberated time there exists a sexual orientation thatís stuck in the closet? The gay community should learn to love Tom Daleyís choices. Say it ainít so, Chris! Is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie coming clean about Bridgegate? A new Rasmussen poll shows that 54 percent of New Jerseyans think itís ìsomewhat likelyíí that the governor fibbed when he denied he knew about the plot to shut down lanes on the George Washington Bridge. And on Friday, the state Assembly released damning e-mails revealing that Christieís top appointee to the Port Authority covered up the treachery. ìI am on my way to office to discuss. There can be no public disclosure,íí Bill Baroni, then the PAís deputy executive director, wrote on Sept. 13 to PA head David Foye, after days of traffic-snarling, ambulance-delaying lane closures. The cover story told by officials was that lanes were closed for a traffic study ó to see what would happen if two lanes from Fort Lee to the George Washington Bridge were cut off during the morning commute. Now we know: crushing, four-hour traffic jams. Christieís now-fired deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, sent an e-mail to the Port Authority in August requesting ìtraffic problems in Fort Lee.íí And the governor didnít know? I have long supported Christieís potential candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. But if he lied, itís over. Web TV, with just a flash of Weiner. Anthony Weiner kept it clean.

250,"Finally, after two months of horror, President Obama heard cheering when he discussed ObamaCare. OK, so the cheering came from members of his own staff, who were assembled in the White House briefing room to hear him speak Tuesday afternoon. But listen, the guy has had a hard time since Oct. 1; he can use all the cheering he can get. The speech was promoted as part of an aggressive new effort to promote ObamaCare following the repairs (far from completed) made to the HealthCare.gov Web site. If that was the intent, it was a colossal failure. The president said nothing ó and I mean literally nothing ó he hasnít said before in defense of ObamaCare. He delivered the same tribute to its glories and wonders Iíve heard him give so many times now, I couldíve written it myself. No, in truth, yesterday wasnít about ObamaCare. It was about Obama. It was about bucking up the boss. It was about showing him some love. The fact that Obama was in on the tribute to himself only adds to the poignancy. You have to be a little desperate to agree to organize and promote a support rally to boost your own spirits. He got the applause he wanted. He got the love he needed. He got MSNBC talk personalities to speak admiringly of him. So by those standards, if by no other, the speech was a roaring success. It may even have kicked off a new lifestyle trend: Are you a boss? Things getting you down? Have a pep rally in the staff cafeteria and make sure your staff gives you a big round of applause! The event began with some of those ordinary folk who can claim to have benefited from ObamaCare already. One of them was a young woman named Monica (no, not that Monica) who has Crohnís disease. She said that ObamaCare had had such a positive effect on her life, since she can stay on her parentsí insurance until sheís 26, that she can now pursue photography as a career. Well, that was worth the whole $1.8 trillion ObamaCare price tag right there. Then the president got up. As he has since the Web-site catastrophe began, he acknowledged the problems up front before moving on quickly to the great achievements of ObamaCare, including 500,000 newly insured people. He did not mention the 1<U+2009>million-plus in California whose policies have been cancelled, of course, but why should he? This was his day, his chance to shine, his turn to tell the story ó it would be ungenerous to cavil. ìMy main message today is weíre not going back,î Obama said. ìWeíre not repealing it as long as Iím president.î This is the sentence that caused the standing ovation. If the president has been reduced to defiant statements that heís not going to do something no one expects him to do, and that no one expects will happen, heís in worse shape than even Ted Cruz hopes. Now that heís had his little pep rally, President Obama would be well-advised to go under the radar again for a while. According to Gallup, the more facts people know about ObamaCare, the less likely they are to support it. It would appear that itís better for the president if people live in blissful ignorance rather than horrified awareness.",President leads the cheers for himself | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/12/04/president-leads-the-cheers-for-himself/
251,"NEW DELHI: An academician who recently joined the Aam Aadmi Party has called it the biggest coalition in modern day politics. And since its spectacular showing in Delhi, this coalition has only grown. People with differing ideologies, objectives and ambitions have joined the party. And now AAP now faces one of its biggest challenges - how to manage the problem of growth that comes with the incursion of a motley crowd. The signs are for all to see. Vinod Kumar Binny , for instance, appears to be driving on a different highway of personal ambition. Capt Gopinath, who has just joined AAP, appears disillusioned by the party's opposition to FDI in retail. Mallika Sarabhai has discovered that her party colleague Kumar Vishwas's views on women and minorities are regressive. Former BJP member Tina Sharma claims the party is focused on the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and had forgotten its promise of creating of a commando force for women. And so on. Even an AAP old-timer like Prashant Bhushan hasn't helped by airing his ""personal views"" on the army's role in Kashmir. On Wednesday, former CPI member Kamal Mitra Chenoy, who joined AAP this week, attracted drew attention with his comments on Kashmir. ""I tweeted maybe 2-3 years back. At one place I had said that Yasin Malik should not fight with the Hurriyat and should present a united front. The second comment was after Afzal Guru was hanged and I said that he was a martyr for the Kashmiri people. Someone is trying to create an embarrassing situation for me and AAP by taking these old comments out of context and playing them up now,"" he said. Reacting to the seeming confusion in AAP, senior party leader Yogendra Yadav said, ""Much of the confusion has been created by the media. We have 1.5 million ordinary members as of now. We welcome them all but we can't be expected or demand that they have identical views. These members have no role to play in the decision-making process of the party so any conflict in their views is besides the point."" Social anthropologist Shiv Vishwanathan also didn't appear too perturbed by the exuberance of democracy in AAP. He said that AAP was a ""happy coalition of individuals"" and would take some time to become a party. ""There is a slight anarchy in the unilateral statements being made by some members. Kejriwal must resolve this,"" he said. He added that the party should put across a statement of ideology and a methodology for consensus and conflict resolution. AAP sources said that the party had set up 31 committees with 160 experts to establish a national manifesto by March. Another AAP leader, who didn't want to be identified, said concerns about differing voices in AAP were misplaced. ""AAP is not a radical left or right wing party. People who are joining us have held certain beliefs and convictions for years. We cannot expect them to disown their convictions. But AAP's common agenda remains the same: anti-corruption, against misgovernance and against VIP culture and all members are united on that,"" he said.","Binny vs Kejriwal, Mallika vs Vishwas: Can AAP manage its motley crowd? - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/binny-vs-kejriwal-mallika-vs-vishwas-can-aap-manage-its-motley-crowd/articleshow/28875648.cms

NEW DELHI: Soon after a fresh rebellion by Vinod Kumar Binny in Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), it was reported on Wednesday that national parties are trying to woo the AAP MLA into joining them. ""A national party is looking to rope in Vinod Binny and may offer him a Lok Sabha ticket,"" reported Times Now. However, earlier in the day, Binny denied any intention of leaving the party. ""I am an honest foot soldier of AAP. It's not anyone's personal party. There is no question of leaving AAP,"" he said. Reacting to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's claim that he had asked for a Lok Sabha ticket, Binny said, ""If Arvind bhai has said this then its unfortunate, then no one is a bigger liar than him. There was no talk of LS tickets."" Binny had expressed dissatisfaction over the Delhi government's functioning. Binny claimed that the Delhi government is drifting from core issues. ""I will divulge more details in a news conference,"" Binny said. Binny said he was not upset over not becoming a minister and wanted to raise issues in public interest. ""I am not upset over anything. The party is deviating from the main issues. Hence, it is important for us to make them realise that we are in the party for its cause and the issues it raised,"" the MLA said. ""There are a lot of differences between the promises we made and how it's going to be delivered,"" Binny said. Criticising the Delhi government for its style of functioning, Binny said, ""The issues on the basis of which the party came to power, I feel party is drifting away from it."" Binny also threatened to go on a hunger strike. Kejriwal had hit back at Binny, questioning why the latter had not raised his issues related to the party's functioning in meetings. ""Why didn't Binny speak in yesterday's meet of candidates who had contested Assembly polls if he wanted to on certain issues,"" Kejriwal asked. Stating that Binny wanted a cabinet berth first and recently asked him for Lok Sabha ticket, Kejriwal said, ""Party has decided sitting MLAs won't get ticket for MP post."" Kejriwal said there was a meeting of all 70 candidates who contested the Delhi polls but the MLA did not raise a single point in the meeting.

253,"US retailers sales rose by a modest 0.2 percent in December as Americans stocked up on food and drinks for the holidays, bought more clothes and purchased more goods online, according to government data issued Tuesday. Yet the increase would have been a healthier 0.7 percent if the auto sector was excluded, the Commerce Department reported. Auto sales hit a post-recession high in November but then tapered off last month. Retail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending, the main engine of economic growth. What tempered the gains in the final month of the year, however, were reductions in the pace of retail sales for November and October. The sales increase for November was lowered to 0.4 percent from 0.7 percent, while the increase for October was trimmed one-tenth to 0.5 percent. The downward revisions are likely to spur some economists to cut growth forecasts for the fourth quarter. By and large, 2013 turned out to be a subpar year for retailers. Sales rose by 4.2 percent, marking the smallest annual gain since the recession ended in mid-2009. Retailers were hurt in part by a tax increase on millions of Americans at the start of the year. In a typical year, retail sales are about one-third higher. In December, sales jumped 1.4 percent at Internet retailers, 2 percent for food and beverage stores and 1.8 percent for outlets that sell clothes. The spike in sales for food and drinks followed two straight declines. Sales also rose 1.6 percent at gas stations to reflect somewhat higher prices at the pump last month. Sales at auto dealerships, meanwhile, dropped 1.6 percent. Auto dealers attracted lots of buyers in November with big discounts, likely cutting into the sales that might have occurred in December. Autos account for about one-quarter of all retail sales. The amount of money consumers spent at electronics and appliance stores fell an even sharper 2.5 percent in December, and sales actually fell in that category over the past 12 months. Home and garden retailers, department stores and outlets that sell sports and hobby items also saw a decline in purchases.",US retailers see rise in December sales | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/us-retailers-see-rise-in-december-sales/
254,"Starbucks app leaves passwords vulnerable. Starbucks acknowledged its mobile app has a vulnerability that stores customer passwords without encryption. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Starbucks' mobile app leaves customers' passwords open to attack, according to a research report. The popular app, which allows Starbucks ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ) customers to purchase drinks and food directly from their smartphones, saves customers' usernames, passwords and other personal information in plain text. That means a hacker could pick up a left-behind phone, plug it into a laptop and easily recover a Starbucks customer's password without even knowing the smartphone's PIN code. Starbucks spokeswoman Linda Mills acknowledged the vulnerability and said the possibility of the vulnerability being exploited is ""very far fetched."" Mills and Jim Olson, another Starbucks spokesman, said no customers have claimed to have been hacked as a result. ""Obviously the security of our customers' information is of the utmost importance to Starbucks and we're monitoring for any risks and vulnerabilities,"" Olson said. After CNNMoney and other outlets reported the issue, the company announced in a letter to customers it was ""working to accelerate the deployment of an update for the app that will add extra layers of protection."" On Wednesday, Olson stressed the company was ""always evolving and enhancing our systems to ensure that our systems are secure."" Exploiting the issue wouldn't be easy. To access a customer's password, a hacker needs to be in possession of the phone, have a computer handy, and know how to access the file. If a hacker does obtain the password, it would allow him or her access to money stored in the customer's Starbucks account. Customers could be at greater risk if they use the same password for other sites. The issue was first exposed by security researcher Daniel Wood, a Starbucks customer who said he tested the app to see if his information was secure. ""The application is storing the users' information -- everything from your full name to your address to your username and password as well as your email address,"" he told CNNMoney. Wood disclosed the issue in an online posting after approaching the company in December without a response from technical teams. After the issue became public, he was contacted by Starbucks. On Tuesday, his post was reported by the technology site ComputerWorld . Olson said Starbucks had reached out to Wood regarding his report. The Starbucks apps are used by about 10 million customers, Olson said.","Starbucks app leaves passwords vulnerable - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/technology/security/starbucks-app-passwords/index.html

The good news for investors who were worried over the sluggish trend in the growth of traditional software services since the past few quarters was the 3.1% sequential increase in this segment during the December 2013 quarter. However, retaining the traction in this largely commoditised business segment will be a challenge.

Following are brokerages' views on the stock post Q2 results: Sharekhan: The big surprise was the better-than-expected margin performance despite the company facing headwinds in terms of wage hike during the quarter (120 bps impact). EBITDA margins were largely stable at 26 per cent (as against our estimates of a fall by 112 bps). HCL Tech reported impressive results with a positive surprise on the margin front and revival of growth in its IT services business. Strong growth in BPO and IMS segments also reflects a more diversified growth model and augurs well for further re-rating of the stock. We maintain our buy rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,564. IDBI Capital: HCL Tech reported revenue of $1,321 million which was in line with IDBI estimates of $1,320 million; and a tad better than the consensus. The 3 per cent CC growth in Q2 was broad-based across verticals, service lines and geographies. HCL Tech's EBITDA margin at 26 per cent in Q2 came in 100 bps ahead of IDBI and Street estimates, largely driven by better gross margins and SG&A rationalization. Net profit of Rs 1,470 crore came around 4-5 per cent ahead of estimates, largely driven by flow through impact of better margins coupled with lower depreciation and tax rate. We have a 'buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,295. The company has increased its interim dividend to Rs 4 from earlier Rs 2. Dolat Capital Market: We believe the constant currency growth of 3 per cent CQGR for over last six quarters and modest employee add of just over 1 per cent on LTM basis contradicts the large and regular multi-billion dollar TCV additions highlighted by the company in the recent past.",Brokerages bullish on HCL Tech post Q2 results - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/stocks-in-news/brokerages-bullish-on-hcl-tech-post-q2-results/articleshow/28878419.cms

259,"MUMBAI: The banking sector, which will see the entry of new players this year, is witnessing a hectic pace of activity on the HR front. An unusually high percentage of hiring is taking place, which is being attributed not only to branch expansion by existing banks but also to the new banking licences that are expected to be issued. Experts believe this could lead to a war for talent. Prospective players are said to be researching employee databases in existing banks to identify talent. Some are believed to have even kept banking personnel on a standby so that they can hit the ground running, if and when they bag a licence. With the fear of being poached by new players, existing banks, on the other hand, are boosting their strength and using innovative employee retention tools. Some could even look at golden handcuffs, if faced with a loss of talent, industry sources said. ""The banking sector where the hiring rate was not more than 15-20% in 2012-13, has witnessed a spurt in hiring of around 60% till December last year. Most of the existing banks are gearing up by increasing their headcount in order to stay ahead. We expect the trend to continue and grow stronger,"" said Ajay Shah, general manager (BFSI), TeamLease Services, a staffing company. ""Companies/financial services firms aspiring for a banking licence are putting in place a database of people for senior positions (CXO/CXO-1 levels) that will form the core team. Given their established credentials of having built businesses from ground up, key people in Indian private banks are likely to be prime targets for the new entrants,"" said Animesh Kumar, group head, HR & corporate services, IDFC. Firms which bag banking licences would get about 18 months to launch operations. To cut down on cycle times and costs, technology, big data and analytics will be key drivers of new ways of acquiring talent and delivering services and products. ""An important source of talent for prospective banking firms would be women managers, especially those who have taken a career break and are now desirous of coming back into formal employment,"" said IDFC's Kumar. Another interesting talent pool for banking aspirants, he said, is likely to be the Indian diaspora, which is now looking to relocate back to India for personal reasons. Santrupt Misra, group HR head, Aditya Birla Group, however, said, the group is not hiring for banking. ""It will be presumptuous on our part to do so as the licence issue is not decided,"" he said. The group is not worried given its strong employer brand. ""Should we get a licence, we will take up hiring. Some companies may have done opportunity hiring or may be meeting other needs that are current hoping to leverage when the bank comes up,"" said Misra. While private banks are worried about the HR challenge, they too are sprucing up their strength. Axis Bank , for instance, is expected to see a double-digit headcount growth this year. The bank is tapping on growth potential at unbanked locations. ""Hiring is primarily towards the expansion plan of the bank. The new banking licences would have an impact few years later,"" said Rajesh Dahiya, president-HR, Axis Bank, who is hopeful that its employee engagement initiatives and growth opportunities within the bank would help retain key talent. Ratnakar Bank , on the other hand, is expected to close the year (March 31, 2014) with 1,000 hires this year to take its total strength of 2,600 employees. ""The way plans are being discussed, we will continue to hire around 500 or so even in the next year, but it is not finalized yet,"" said Tajinder Kumar, head-HR, Ratnakar Bank. Kumar admits shortage of talent is a challenge for the sector. ""Existing private banks, other banks and even public sector banks have stepped up hiring efforts in a big way. When new banks come up, although one is not clear on date and count, they will also have a requirement of senior management people,"" he said. So is it an unusual trend? ""It seems to be a period of significant change in the sector. Technology is playing a very important role in this change, so is operations and sales and distribution . Newer ways of work require different skills, so re-skilling is key,"" said Ratnakar Bank's Kumar. Even customer expectations have changed.

Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar claimed on Twitter that she was posting from her husband's account, intimate private messages sent to him by Lahore-based journalist Mehr Tarar , to show the world ""how she is stalking my husband"". Pushkar confirmed to ET that she had posted the messages on Tharoor's Twitter account and her Twitter account had not been hacked. ""Our accounts have not been hacked and I have been sending out these tweets. I cannot tolerate this.

He did not respond to a text message asking if he wanted to respond to his wife's subsequent quote to this newspaper. ""Sorry folks, my Twitter account has been hacked and will be temporarily deactivated. Bear with me while we solve this,"" he posted on Twitter.

Tharoor, a former United Nations diplomat and the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram, is one of the most followed Indian politicians on Twitter, with more than two million followers. Tharoor resigned in 2010 as junior minister for external affairs after Indian Premier League's then chairman Lalit Modi alleged that Tharoor's friend Sunanda Pushkar had been gifted sweat equity in a consortium that was bidding to become the Kerala team in the twenty-over Cricket tournament. Tharoor said at the time that his support to the consortium bidding for the Kochi franchise was purely as a mentor and he did not benefit from it financially. Tharoor and Pushkar married subsequently. Tarar, the Pakistani journalist, distanced herself from the controversy. ""Okay. What's going on? Who's tweeting to me?

261,"The jolt at Billboard is expected to see former Blender Editor-in-Chief Joe Levy elevated into the recently vacated editorial director job at the music trade title and its related digital ops, according to the buzz on the street. Levy, a consumer magazine veteran, was lured to the No. 2 job at Billboard in mid-2012 from Maxim, where he had spent three years as chief content officer. Earlier he was EIC of the now-defunct music magazine Blender. Bill Werde, who until Wednesday was the Billboard editorial director, was one of the casualties when The Hollywood Reporter Editor-in-Chief Janice Min was elevated to president and chief creative officer of Guggenheim.

Min is charged with injecting some of the buzz she generated at THR over the past three years into Billboard, which has consumer recognition beyond the music trade thanks to its top-song charts and an annual awards show on ABC-TV. Both Levy and Min spent a long stretch at Wenner Media ó Levy as executive editor of Rolling Stone and Min as EIC of Us Weekly. Min is said to have played hardball in negotiations with Guggenheim Partners, the venture capital firm that owns Guggenheim Media, by threatening to jump ship to an executive job at a cable network.

A spokesman for the cable network declined to comment. Min also declined to give a comment on the negotiations that led to her promotion and the banishment of her internal rival, Ross Levinsohn, the CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media. Min had chaffed under his direction because, sources said, she felt he had little publishing or news understanding. Levinsohn gets to keep his title but has no profit and loss responsibilities.

262,"Most government scandals involve the manipulation of the system in obscure ways by people no one has ever heard of. That is why George Washington Bridgegate is nearly a perfect scandal ó because it is comprehensible and (as they say in Hollywood) ìrelatableî to everyone who has ever been in a car. This is the reason this one is not going to go away so easily, even if one accepts the contention that Gov. Chris Christie had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Government officials and political operatives working for Christie, for weird and petty reasons, chose to make traffic worse. Thatís the takeaway. When they are reminded of the fact that people working on Christieís behalf thought it was a good political game to mire tens of thousands of their fellow Americans in the nightmarish gridlock that is a daily dreaded prospect for tens of millions, they will be discomfited by that and by the politician in whose name it was done. And yet, you know what is also something everybody would find ìrelatableî? Politicians who sic the tax man on others for political gain. Everybody has to deal with the IRS and fears it. Last year, we learned from the Internal Revenue Service itself that it had targeted ideological opponents of the president for special scrutiny and investigation ó because they were ideological opponents. Thatís juicy, just as Bridgegate is juicy. Itís something we can all understand, it speaks to our greatest fears, and itís the sort of thing TV newspeople could gab about for days on end without needing a fresh piece of news to keep it going. And yet, according to Scott Whitlock†of the Media Research Center, ìIn less than 24 hours, the three networks have devoted 17 times more coverage to a traffic scandal involving Chris Christie than theyíve allowed in the last six months to Barack Obamaís Internal Revenue Service controversy.î Why? Oh, come on, you know why. Christie belongs to one political party. Obama belongs to the other. You know which ones they belong to. And you know which ones the people at the three networks belong to, too: In surveys going back decades, anywhere from 80% to 90% of Washingtonís journalists say they vote Democratic. Scandals are not just about themselves; they are about the media atmosphere that surrounds them. They are perpetuated and deepened by the attention of journalists, whose relentless pursuit of every angle keeps the story going. That is exactly what has been missing from the IRS scandal from its outset; Republicans in Congress have been the dogged pursuers, not the press. There was plenty of material. Just as journalists remain skeptical today about who exactly might have gotten the idea for the lane closures, they could have been asking without letup who got the idea to dig into conservative tax-status applications. Several officials at the IRS resigned, retired and took the Fifth, just as was the case with Christie-aligned Port Authority officials. Itís pretty clear the questions about how high up Bridgegate went are going to be pursued far more diligently than they have been in the IRS case. What gives? There is a fundamental misunderstanding among conservatives about the causes of partisan media bias ó the reason there is unequal coverage of scandals of this kind. It exists not because there is a conscious effort to soft-pedal bad news for politicians you like and to push hard on bad news for politicians you donít. Itís actually more personal ó more relatable, shall we sayóthan that. Journalists know the Obamans. Intimately. They know them from college, they know them from work, they know them from kidsí soccer. Theyíre literally married to them. To the journalists, the Obamans donít look like crooks and cheats. Far from it. For them, itís like looking in a mirror. In September, Elspeth Reeve of The Atlantic Wire took note of 24 major journalists who have taken posts at senior levels in the Obama administration. All of them have worked for decades in various news organizations, thus creating personal ties and bonds of affection with literally hundreds of working reporters and editors. The journalists are not covering up for their friends and their spouses. They just believe the people they know could not be responsible for behaving badly, or cravenly, or for crass political advantage óand the tone they strike when such things are discussed is often one of offense, as though it is a sign of low character to believe otherwise. It would be, well, like believing the journalists themselves were crooks. Itís fair to say that most conservatives donít know people in the Obama administration, and they dislike and disagree with its policies. When they look at it, their dislike and lack of any personal connection make it easier for them to see officials mired in scandal and tush-covering cover-up. This is a direct analogue to the way liberals ó of whom journalists comprise a central cohort ó viewed the George W. Bush and Reagan administrations. They saw people with whom they disagreed and who they thought were bad for the country and so found it much easier to believe they were acting out of malign motive and doing evil. Christie may be entirely innocent of all wrongdoing. Or there may be some connection, even a very tenuous and suggestive one. But there will be little let-up now.

263,"A new deal with Iran ìmarks the first time in a decadeî that Tehran has agreed to ìhalt progressî in its nuclear program, and even ìroll backî some of it, President Obama proudly announced Sunday. Actually, Sundayís signing marks the second time in two months that Obamaís hailed this deal as a historic unprecedented diplomatic breakthrough. And whatís happened in those weeks bodes poorly for whatís supposed to be a final agreement later in the year. Back in November, this same deal (a gentlemenís agreement, really) between six world powers and the Iranian regime was supposed to launch a six-month period, after which a more comprehensive pact would be signed, and really really end Iranís nuclear-arms dash. The diplomatsí logic was simple enough: We hope to halt Iranís nuclear progress, while they want sanctions removed; start with half-way measure ó weíll remove some sanctions, theyíll stop some nuclear activity. Then hash out a real deal ó with a deadline: Iran has half a year (with an option for one extension) to prove its seriousness. But the November ìdealî wasnít complete; it took two months for diplomats to nail the details. So the six-month clock doesnít start ticking ítil next Monday. And Iranís been busy in weeks between the November ìsigningî and Sundayís signing: Tehran continued to grow its nuclear program, reportedly introducing a new generation of centrifuges to its facilities in Natanz and Fordow, and vigorously building its Arak heavy-water facility. It added 1,000 pounds to its stockpiles of uranium enriched to 5 percent, and 66 pounds to its 20 percent stock, getting it thisclose to breakout capacity. International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors were turned away when they sought to visit the Parchin military base, where the IAEA indicates that Iranians are experimenting with ways to weaponize nukes (Oops: Our diplomats didnít include a right to inspect military bases in the November pact). Oh, and while Obama claims that we can undo the rollback of Iran sanctions at any time, the mullahs used the November agreement to end their global economic isolation: Next month, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is to visit Tehran, signaling a thaw between the two countries. They plan to ink a trade pact worth up to $50 billion a year, which would give Turkey access to Iranís oil and open a major regional market for Iranian goods. Iran is also negotiating an oil-for-goods deal with Russia, worth $1.5 billion a month. This one will revive sales of Iranian crude around the world, which had nearly halted under strict banking and ship-insurance sanctions. Note that Russia is one of the six powers conducting the diplomacy that produced Obamaís ìhistoricî boasts. Meanwhile, Tehran insists that (despite Washingtonís protests to the contrary) the November deal affirms its Allah-given right to enrich uranium. Certainly, the deal at least ignores, if doesnít de facto repeal, a decadeís worth of binding UN Security Council resolutions that explicitly banned all Iranian enrichment. And top Iranian figures ó including the ìmoderatesî ó emphasize that theyíll never halt their nuclear program. Meanwhile, Obama says it could shatter his oh-so-delicate diplomacy for America to even hint that weíd ratchet up sanctions if the deal turns sour. Well, the Senateís on track to defy him. A bill by Senate Foreign Relation Committee Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) would impose added sanctions on Iran if no final agreement is reached after six months. It has 59 co-sponsors and 67 supporters, enough to override a veto ó though Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will delay a vote as long as he can. Administration officials confuse the issue by saying ìnew sanctionsî could sabotage our diplomacy ó ignoring the fact that the billís sanctions come only if the diplomats fail to meet their own time limit. The president himself says the chances of actually reaching a comprehensive deal with Iran are 50-50, yet his supporters insist we press on with diplomacy, claiming the only alternatives are a nuclear Iran or an Israeli strike that would lauch a major regional war. Except a major regional war is already going on, with Sunnis and Shiites fighting across Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, and in flashpoints elsewhere. Worse, it increasingly looks like Iran is winning that struggle ó and we look more and more like its enablers.",Nuke deal looks better yet for Iran | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/nuke-deal-looks-better-yet-for-iran/
264,"MORE FROM. With much ballyhoo, the Obama administration announced this week that it will keep a close eye on school districts that discipline minority students at higher rates than whites. Attorney General Eric Holder and Education Secretary Arne Duncan held a joint press conference to release a ìDear Colleagueî letter to school districts issuing guidance on school discipline that will likely encourage districts to make race a significant factor in deciding how to administer punishment. Holder and Duncan claim their intention is to ensure nondiscrimination in school disciplinary procedures ó but the guidelines theyíve offered will result in exactly the opposite. Black and Hispanic students, on average, experience higher rates of school suspensions and other serious disciplinary actions ó there is little doubt or debate on that score. A Washington Post study last year found that in the DC region, black students were far more likely to be suspended from school than whites or Asians. Just outside of Washington in suburban Montgomery County, Md., 6 percent of black students were either suspended or expelled from school the previous year, while only 1.2 percent of white students suffered the same punishment. The most recent available national school-suspension statistics show that some 15 percent of blacks, 7 percent of Hispanics, 5 percent of whites and 3 percent of Asians are suspended at some point in their school life. But the real question is: Why? If black and Hispanic students engage in behavior thatís punishable by suspension at higher rates than whites or Asians, then we shouldnít be surprised that their punishment rates are higher, as well. On the other hand, if behaviors donít differ or if black students who commit the same infractions as whites get harsher treatment, discrimination is likely the cause. Unfortunately, the DOJ and DOE guidelines go far beyond discouraging actual racial discrimination. In essence, the administration wants school districts to guarantee that minority students donít experience higher rates of suspension or other serious punishments for disciplinary infractions. Itís certainly laudable to try to bring down suspension rates for blacks and Hispanics ó but there are right and wrong ways to go about it, and the administration has chosen the worst way. The guidelines tell school districts that any discipline policy that results in an ìadverse impact on students of a particular race as compared with students of other racesî is problematic. The district must prove that the policy is ìnecessary to meet an important educational goalî and that there are not ìcomparably effective alternative policies or practices that would meet the schoolís stated educational goals.î In the DC-area study, for example, minority students were far more likely to be suspended for ìinsubordinationî than whites. The easiest way to fix the statistical disparity would be for school districts to eliminate insubordination as an infraction punishable by suspension. But whoíd benefit? Students who refuse to follow the rules and behave disrespectfully to teachers and administrators would learn they could get away with it with no consequences, setting them up for future failure in the work world. Students who behaved would find themselves in unruly classrooms, and teachers would find their authority and ability to teach undermined. Meanwhile, the real culprit for racial differences in disciplinary problems among students would go unexamined. More than 70 percent of black babies are born to single moms, as are about 60 percent of Native Americans and 50 percent of Hispanics, but less than 30 percent of whites and 20 percent of Asians. Children who grow up in fatherless homes are exponentially more likely to face school suspension or engage in early criminal behavior. According to the Fatherhood Coalition, fatherless teens are three times more likely to be suspended from school and fatherless teen boys are 10 times more likely to become chronic juvenile offenders than those raised in homes with two parents. Forcing school districts to weaken disciplinary policies or set racial quotas in implementing them serves no one. And those whoíd suffer the most would likely be minority students stuck in undisciplined classrooms.",The Federal war on school discipline | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/10/the-federal-war-on-school-discipline/
265,"The scandal isnít just that a top aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered up massive gridlock at the Fort Lee entrance to the George Washington Bridge in retaliation for the Fort Lee mayorís refusal to endorse Christieís re-election bid. Itís that Port Authority officials went ahead with that political hit. In a two-hour news conference Thursday, Christie said he was ìhumiliatedî by the actions of his PA appointee, Bill Baroni, Baroniís subordinate and old Christie classmate David Wildstein and top gubernatorial aide Bridget Anne Kelly, all now quit or fired. But this canít just be fixed by resignations and firings ó and not just because the stunt caused life-threatening gridlock when ambulances couldnít get through. The biggest outrage is that the Port Authority is making any decisions based on raw short-term politics. The PA was founded in 1921 as a model of progressive government ó removed from cutthroat politics. Yes, deciding what to build will always be the job of elected officials ó but actually building it and running it is a job for technocrats, not pols or their henchfolk. The two governors created the authority to solve a problem: New York and New Jersey needed to work together on building bridges and tunnels to connect the two states, as well as the ports on both sides of the Hudson. But they kept bickering over who should build what, and where. So the governors would each appoint board members to the new authority, and the board would pick an executive to run it. The board members would come from both states, yet act not on behalf of either state, but for both. Over the next two decades, the PA would build critical crossings, including the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel. But the authority turned rancid a long time ago. Governors started using the PA for unacceptable political ends way back in the í60s ó when Gov. Nelson Rockefeller got it to divert financial resources to building the World Trade Center. (His brother had just built an office tower downtown, and needed company for it.) But itís grown worse in the decades since. In the 1980s, Gov. Mario Cuomo used World Trade Center revenues to fund patronage projects that had nothing to do with ports, bridges (or airports), including real-estate ventures in Queens. Meanwhile, Jersey got a similarly political development in Hoboken. After 9/11, Gov. George Pataki saddled the Port Authority with impossible financial obligations ó $7 billion in debt ó to build One World Trade. Jersey got the obscenely overpriced Calatrava PATH station there. The billions that the Port Authority has spent downtown mean that it doesnít have the money it needs to do what itís supposed to be doing: keeping up bridges and tunnels and modernizing LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark airports. More recently, the PA took over the Atlantic City Airport. Pumping money into Atlantic City to prop up failing casinos has nothing to do with the authorityís mission, but Christie wanted it. (His point man on the takeover: Baroni.) The political interference wastes all kinds of cash. For example, the Port Authority was supposed to hand over security responsibility for the new World Trade Center to the NYPD as a cost-saving measure. But Christie nixed that five-year-old agreement, vowing last year when he accepted the Port Authority Police unionís endorsement that ìnever .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. will there be another police force who will patrol the new World Trade Center.î As for the board: Christie named a former chief of staff and a drug-industry lobbyist. Gov. Andrew Cuomo named a publisher of Spanish-language newspapers. None of this was a news-dominating scandal. But it all adds up ó and contributes to New York and New Jerseyís inability to compete with the rest of the world on better infrastructure. Even without the political gridlock imposed on Fort Lee, the way that successive governors have routinely treated the Port Authority was already a scandal ó and has seriously harmed both statesí ability to be competitive. All along, Port Authority appointees have never spoken up about how political mandates have constrained their ability to serve the public good. (The MTA has the same problem, albeit to a lesser degree.) If Bridgegate proves anything, itís that we need more checks and balances, not less. Consider: The PA did provide some checks and balances ó if Christie alone had run the GW Bridge, weíd still probably be in the dark (and in traffic). But that doesnít change the fact that the agency regularly acts at the behest of sleazy political operatives. New York and New Jersey voters deserve better. That means: no more patronage appointments. No more patronage projects. And when either governor asks the Port Authority to do something rancid, it should just say ìno.î Nicole Gelinas is a contributing editor of the Manhattan Instituteís City Journal.",Port Authority rife with ugly politics | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/10/a-rancid-authority/

Mom moved us out to Vegas in 1972, when I was 3. Before that, we were based in Philadelphia. She stayed at home with us while Dad worked at his fatherís casino in New Jersey. Dad wasnít around much, and when he was, he never paid much attention to Mom. But then they went on vacation to Acapulco without us kids where Mom met George, a guy who promised her a life of glitz in Las Vegas. He told her she was beautiful enough to be a showgirl ó that he had the connections to make it happen as an investor in a slot-machine company. To Mom, the vision of a life with a man who would 100 percent focus on her sounded like an escape. They went out to Vegas together first, then the plan was for my siblings and me to join them a few months later, accompanied by our nanny, Delma*. The plan quickly crumbled. Just weeks after Mom got to Vegas, George suddenly died ó leaving her alone. But Mom was resilient, and decided to pursue her goal of being a showgirl anyway. She auditioned for the Tropicana and, at age 32, became the oldest performer in its famous show Les Folies BergËre. She was one of the only girls with children, and one of very few Jews to ever perform there. So Delma, my sister, Rani, 7, my brother, Todd, 8, and I moved out to Vegas and fell into our own routine. Sometimes, weíd go to the Circus Circus casino. There were games and people dressed up ó it felt like Disney World. Twice a month, weíd get dressed up and opt for a special dinner at the local dive, Dust & Rusty Bar. Mom would pile us into a booth and fill up three platesí worth of free bar food. While ìCopacabanaî played in the background, Mom worked the bar, trying to meet a new dad for us ó one who could buy us a house with a pool. Kraussí mother displays the Lash Vegas look. Mom kept her costume and makeup at the Tropicana so we wouldnít see her all dolled up, with her three layers of foundation and five pairs of fake lashes. Once, however, Delma took us to the venue and we sat front-row. She clutched a cross, muttering prayers under her breath. ìHoly Mary, mother of God,î she was saying. I didnít know why she was praying. I just thought she was silly to miss Momís amazing performance! The stage version of my mom was like catnip for men. Roses were sent to her dressing room every night. When celebs came into town ó like ìGodfatherî author Mario Puzo and Sammy Davis Jr. ó theyíd pose for photos with her. But sheíd never tell those guys about me and my siblings ó it would ruin the fantasy. Then she met Paul, a Realtor. He came on strong. And she made a strategic move sheíd come to regret. After only knowing her for a couple of days, Paul said he wanted Mom and us kids to move in with him ó into his house with a pool. ìI wonít move in with a man until Iím married again,î Mom said. ìThen marry me,î he replied. They got hitched that week. Afterwards, he started making demands. Paul hated that Mom performed nearly naked for men, so he demanded she quit. But she loved her job with all the camaraderie and attention. Then the Tropicana got bought by mobsters. They were going to make it all-nude. Mom had a limit ó and performing sans pasties was it. Mom (far left) and her Vegas showgirl pals cool off backstage between sets at the Tropicana. Even though she was no longer in the show, things with Paul got worse. He abused Mom, my sister and me. But Rani and I never said a word about it. To cope with her own abuse, Mom drank. And Paul was constantly drunk. Theyíd have bruising, loud fights and make up with even louder sex, sometimes in front of us kids. Without the show for Mom to escape to, our own sweltering hell in Vegas continued for five more years ó until Rani was brave enough to tell Mom what Paul was doing to her when the lights went out. Mom realized she had to get away. She filed for divorce, and we moved back to Philly in 1979. Mom eventually got married for the third time to an insurance agent. We had a normal suburban life. Mom began selling real estate, and I made friends running track in middle school. If anyone ever asked about our past, Iíd shrug and say we lived in Vegas for a while. I was a scaredy-cat of a kid even after we were away from Paul, who I later found out, died. I hated being alone, and would have to check under my bed and in the closet before I could sleep. But I buried those feelings for years, never telling anyone what we went through. Vegas was like a distant, painful memory that we didnít talk about as a family. But it came back to haunt me on Momís 45th birthday. I was 18, and we had a big group of family and friends over for a party. I walked into the house and saw that someone had taped up photos of Mom in her old showgirl gear all over the walls. My secret was out ó I felt exposed and suffocated. ìTake these down, Mom,î I gasped. ìOh, come on. Itís fun!î she responded. Even though some of the worst years of her life were in Vegas, she had fond memories of the Tropicana ó not to mention she was proud of that killer body. I wasnít ready to talk about it. Those half-naked pictures were humiliating and represented the terror of my childhood. When I moved to New York City after college to begin a career in publishing, I started therapy to deal with my anxiety. Iíd made a name for myself in marketing. I was engaged to an amazing man. My life was great ó but my past was taking its toll and I had anxiety attacks. Suzanne R. Krauss and her mom before Vegas. Engelbert Humperdinck wanted fun with Mom. It took just one session with a therapist to connect my secret past and my stress. The more I began to open up, the more questions I had. Mom told me everything, and some amusing anecdotes I couldnít even have imagined ó including the time Engelbert Humperdinck propositioned her and the fact she slept with Mr. Universe just to get a peek at his package. (Turns out he wasnít as enormous as she feared and, yes, he flexed on command for her.) Seeing this side of her ó and realizing how spirited and resilient she is ó really helped. Today, Iím proud of my mom and what we went through. More than two decades after that birthday party, Iím finally ready to talk about those years in Vegas. Iím very close with my mom today, and she is a marvelous grandmother. At 72, sheíll spend hours chasing my kids around in the yard, and they adore her. One of Momís old performing photos is on my bookís cover. And, just the other day, my daughter had a friend over. I heard them talking about the photo. ìWhoís this?î her friend asked. My daughter paused before mumbling, ìI donít know.î Of course, she did know who it was, but, like me at her age, she must have been embarrassed to see her grandmother in scanty performing duds.",ëMy mom was a Vegas showgirlí | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/my-mom-was-a-vegas-showgirl/
267,"Retail sales edge higher in December. This holiday season wasn't the Christmas miracle that retailers were hoping for, but sales were slightly higher in December. Retail sales ticked up 0.2% in December, according to a report from the Census Bureau. Economists were expecting sales to be flat from November. November sales, however, were revised lower. The government said sales grew by 0.4% in November from October, down from the 0.7% it had originally reported last month. The number was lifted by strong sales in food, clothing and accessories and gasoline -- necessities or gifts on the lower end of the price spectrum. Sales at nonstore retailers, which includes online shopping, increased by 1.4%. But big-ticket items that are generally considered staples of the holiday season weighed on the number. Sales at electronic and appliance stores fell by 2.5%, and auto dealers saw a 1.9% drop. Experts say that weather could have played a part in what sold, and what didn't sell, last month. ""If you look at what lifted spending -- food, gasoline, clothing, online shopping -- are all things you can expect to increase when the weather is bad,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. ""Harsh weather could have hurt some of the bigger discretionary items."" LaVorgna also said that these better-than-expected numbers should calm investors who were anxious after last week's lackluster jobs report. The government reported that hiring slumped sharply in December , making it the weakest month for job growth since January 2011, the Labor Department said last week. There were signs of weakness for retailers beginning Thanksgiving weekend, the start of the of holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation reported that shoppers spent an average of 4% less over that holiday weekend, the first time spending declined since 2009, when the recession cut deeply into spending. Industry analyst ShopperTrak reported a modest 2.3% increase in spending on Thanksgiving day and Black Friday. Analysts had long expected holiday sales to be sluggish this year. In November, Morgan Stanley predicted that sales growth during the fourth quarter would be the weakest since 2008. The calendar was also expected to hurt sales, since there were six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this past holiday season compared to a year earlier. This means that there were not only fewer opportunities for shoppers to get to stores, but also that stores would likely cut prices earlier and in a bigger way to try to lure customers in to make up for it.","Retail sales edge higher in December - Jan. 14, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/14/news/economy/retail-sales/index.html
268,"Google's plot to take over your digital life. Google is knocking at your front door. It wants to come inside and quietly take control of everything in your home and your digital life. For years, Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) has been buying and building the tools to do just that. This week's $3.2 billion purchase of Nest , a smart thermostat and smoke detector company, is just the latest step. In the near future, these seemingly random interests may not seem so disconnected. Today's emerging technologies will eventually blend together. The divisions between smartphones, home automation, cars, smart glasses and watches and fitness trackers will fall away and our gadgets and data will work together to form a seamless experience. How the Nest thermostat was created. That means someday soon all of your devices will communicate with each other. Your self-driving car will share notifications from your smartphone, turn it over to your Google Glass when you park and start walking, and then a smart home can take over when you walk through your front door. Thanks to GPS on your phone and car, your house will know exactly when you are arriving and will turn on your favorite TV show when you walk inside. Your refrigerator will know what food is inside and when it expires, and security systems could send your smartphone a notification when they detect anything unusual. Streams of data from all these devices will be collected in one place, where Google will analyze that information and learn about you over time. It will then program your hardware and software to meet your unique needs. If this is the future, it's no mystery why Google would want to get into the business now. The potential business opportunity is massive. A spokesman for Google declined to comment for this story. But why smoke detectors and thermostats? While the devices have been popular, it's what's behind the scenes and inside the gadgets that makes Nest a coveted get for Google. Eventually, Google will likely tap the Nest team's expertise to help with its own hit-and-miss attempts at creating and selling connected home devices and platforms (remember the Nexus Q or Android@Home?). But Google owning another tool that would allow it to gather more data has immediately triggered privacy concerns. Fresh off of an unpopular decision to allow Google+ contacts to contact people in their circles through Gmail, Google already has users who are unsettled by the vast amounts of data the company can collect. Google has access to a person's data through its Chrome browser, Gmail accounts, Google search terms and the many advanced sensors on an Android smartphone. As Google aims to become more ingrained in our digital lives, it will have to tread carefully to maintain users' trust.","Google's plot to take over your digital life - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/technology/innovation/google-nest/index.html
269,"That seems to be the unintended message of a poster with stars Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin linking the romantic thriller ìLabor Day,íí which opens Jan. 31, to National Pie Day on Jan. 23. A spokeswoman for the American Pie Council, Mary Deatrick, said the tie-in poster was distributed to pie shops and bakeries nationwide. ìItís not just dessert, itís a tradition,íí reads the poster copy from the American Pie Council. ìThroughout our lives itís always been there, like family and friends. It doesnít matter if itís Apple, Cherry and Chocolate Cream. It makes the time we spend together, just a little sweeter. Pie. Grab a slice of life.íí Apple pie-making does indeed have a prominent scene in ìLabor Day,íí which a press release gushes ìshares the APCís message of passing down pie-making skills from generation to generation.íí But what makes this a truly eccentric choice for a promotion is that Brolin plays a convicted murderer who escapes from prison. He holds Winslet and her 13-year-old son, played by Gattlin Griffith, as hostages. A bond does emerge between Brolin and his hostages before he surrenders to police. But still. The APCís press release does cop to the fact that Brolin is playing an escaped convict, ìa man both intimidating and in need of help.íí But it omits the fact that before they all make pies together, he abducts them from a supermarket and ties both of them up, as you can see from the trailer below. Which may come as a bit of a surprise to the winner of the private viewing party being given away as a prize on the APCís Facebook page. APC executive director Linda Dailey told Marketing Daily this was the first time her group has partnered with a movie studio on a promotion, though pies have been prominently featured in movies like ìWaitressíí and ìAmerican Pie.íí ìWith the movie coming out, weíd sure like to encourage people to teach each other how to make pie,íí she said. ìIt certainly encourages the pie-making process, and weíre very excited to be a part of it.î Deatrick said she didnít believe the APC paid Paramount Pictures for use of an image in the poster, or subsidized the movie.

270,"MOVIE REVIEW. Ride Along. ìRide Alongî tries to be a comic version of ìTraining Day,î only thereís nothing in it as funny as Denzel razzing Ethan. Thereís nothing much funny in it at all. Ice Cube plays James, a cop who canít stand Kevin Hart, which is pretty easy to imagine, only unlike Cube I still couldnít stand Hart at the end. Hart plays Ben, a Paul Blart type who dreams of being a supercop and eagerly agrees to go on a daylong ride with James, the kind of tough undercover man for whom a routine investigation into some forged passports somehow turns into a shootout and a drive through a fireball. Cubeís James doesnít want his beautiful sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) to marry Ben, a half-pint gamer nerd who calls himself ìBlackhammerî on his super-soldier video game and once set fire to James at a barbecue. So the cop figures heíll haze the younger man for a day and this will somehow keep the little guy from becoming his brother-in-law. The movie depends entirely on how funny you think Kevin Hart is. All I see is a twitchy little rooster who needs to switch to decaf or remove his finger from the nearest electrical outlet. He jerks and jukes his way through the movie, begging us to laugh and crashing into stationary objects. His models seem to be Chris Tucker and Eddie Murphy, but Tucker was infused with nuttiness whereas Hart just seems to be trying too hard. Heíd do better learning some of Murphyís í80s cool. The script rumbles along from one little-guy joke after another. James sends Ben to ask some biker outlaws to move their hogs, and liíl Ben is immediately surrounded by menacingly large, hairy dudes. Thereís nowhere to go with that scene except for a lame gag about a bearded lady, so we move on to a playground where Ben gets in an argument with a small child who bests him. Then, itís on to a shooting range where Ben is so wee he gets thrown against the wall by the kick from firing a shotgun. Cube is a pro at playing gruff and street-smart, so itís tiresome to watch him reduced to lobbing lazy insults at his motor-mouthed would-be partner. ìHeís about one chromosome away from being a midgetî is the best of these.

272,"Alex Rodriguez may have a team of lawyers fighting to get him back in baseball in 2014, but the suspended Yankees third baseman sounds like a man resigned to his fate. Rodriguez, speaking in Spanish at an appearance in Mexico, broke his silence when he spoke with the media Wednesday for the first time since an independent arbitrator suspended him for the entire season. ìI think that the year 2014 could be a big favor that [Major League Baseball has] done for me because Iíve been playing for 20 years without a timeout,î he said. ìI think 2014 is a good year to rest mentally and physically and prepare for the future and begin a new chapter in my life.î On Saturday, arbitrator Fredric Horowitz reduced Rodriguezís 211-game ban, but still left him suspended for entire 2014 season ó including the postseason ó for using three banned performance-enhancing drugs and two incidents of obstructing the investigation. Team A-Rod responded by filing suits against MLB and the MLB Playersí Association to overturn his suspension. ESPN aired a video of Rodriguezís appearance early Thursday morning. In it, Rodriguez ó in front of a backdrop promoting the recently opened Alex Rodriguez Energy Fitness Center in Mexico City ó spoke in Spanish for about a minute and did not take questions. Rodriguez said heís received support, ìnot just from my Yankees teammates, but also players from other teams, retired players, Hall of Fame players and lots of good people, owners of other teams.î Rodriguez, whose representatives have said he intends to attend spring training, which he has the right to do, said he is already looking forward to the 2015 season. ìI have three years left on my contract starting in 2015 and I hope to play very well and finish my career in New York,î he said. Rodriguez did not mention PEDs or his suspension directly, but did seem to address it. ì[To] tell the truth, itís a very sad situation and we hope to get this out of every newspaper and start concentrating on all the good things that MLB is doing and the great things that young ballplayers are doing and move forward,î he said. Rodriguezís spokesman, Ron Berkowitz, suggested the legal wrangling and public scrutiny has been ìtaxingî for the superstar third baseman. ìThis process has been taxing both mentally and physically throughout the past eight months,î Berkowitz said. ìAlex will abide by the rulings of the federal judge ó whatever he decides ó and get ready for 2015 should the judge rule against him. He will continue to move forward with his complaint which will help all players against this unfair system.î Will A-Rod play for the Yankees again? Bottom line major league baseball appointing themselves judge and jury in this case is wrong. Where else is purchasing evidence and buying people to testify ethical or even legal? And would this type of judging and evidence be allowed if this were a real court. .no! Im not disputing that A Rod took steroids but baseball is going overboard to get something on this and he didn't pop on the test. No other sport goes this far all they do is testing if you don't fail you shouldn't be a target. Selig is responsible for knowing about it in the 80s 90s but he let it go on because that was the golden era when baseball was the most exciting. This information should have to stand up in court not baseball. Not to mention he and the few that were mentioned aren't the only ones doing it. Why is McGuire in the hall of fame. ..so many inconsistencies. What a crock!† He's trying to save face because he knows he's guilty and has been caught and they have exhausted all avenues when the arbiter ruled his suspension. Now he says he was ready for a break--GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's a cheat and a loser and he shouldn't be allowed to play any more because he disrespected all the players who played the right way.† Now he wants to try to make people think other players and owners support him--YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""super start third baseman"" - I guess they took that one right out of his self indulging press release - please Arod - take a permanent break - it's time for everyone to move on as you are a disgrace to the game and you dragged everyone else into this nightmarish view of your narcissistic career. The A-rod energy fitness center, exactly what is that code for? This is like a very bad joke, firstly can you imagine what he is going to look like physically after a full year of no PEDs cocktails? He already was fairly useless on the field, a year with no juice will and he will make Joe Hardy look like an 18 y.o. This is another tragic figure like Clemens who simply is suffering from the delusion that they can say something over and over and make it true. They are living in a bubble and can't deal with reality. A few mentioned ""The Pope"" of talk radio. †He is an absolute boorish individual who continually contradicts himself with regard to Arod. †Example: he says he can't believe anything Bosch says because he's lied in the past and has every reason to lie since MLB paid. †News flash ""Pope"": Arod is an admitted liar and had $27M reasons to lie too! †What a farce he is. †Never lets any call-in person finish a sentence, always interrupting to inject his stupidity. †Sorry......rant over. A-Roid is baseball anthrax.† No one wants to get anywhere near this guy. No manager, general manager or team will ever give him a look. If he thinks he was under a microscope before, wait and see what happens in 2015 if he is dumb enough to make a come back run. What player would want to call him their ""teammate"". He has a good idea though. Go to Mexico and start a chain of fitness and energy centers, where he can sell his nutritional supplements in 1 to 3 mg cups. Looks like A-Rod has resigned himself to the† 1 year suspension. I think it can be a positive result for him. He can get himself in shape for 2015 and move on. I think his suspension for 1 year was excessive. It should have been no greater than was given to the others.A -rod is a good guy and i wish him well and future success. A little late in the game to pull the contrition card Afraud. I don't know how much you paid your legal and PR team but they sure got this assbackwards. This is where your argument should have started. Apparently the PEDs have scrambled something above the neckline. Support from so many GOOD people? Oh, please. The guy is a psychotic imbecile. He's talking about all the love and support he is receiving from fellow teammates, players, owners, etc. I would immediately put anybody supporting him on the 'Steroid Watch List'. He will never play another MLB game - thank God! Nobody would touch Barry Bonds after his contract expired in San Francisco, even though he was coming off of a very good year and proved he had gas left in the tank, why would any team touch this Choke Artist Loser??? Seriously ? What's the color of the sky in your world?...Guy is a lying drug cheat who is only out to save his millions and doesnt care about anyone but himself....but he's a victim..let me know when you wake up. @Ted Smith Dead straight on the Pope, Ted.† YES mgt and the Yankees finally had their fill of this gas bag and did not renew his services contract.† The Pope does occasionally make a decent point in his broadcast and then repeats† 3-4 times.† We got it the first time, McWindy! He is incredibly rude to his callers.† Cuts many off immediately.† Has a ego to match his waistline.† I predict he'll explode while eating a glazed donut at his new gig on MSG. @ Alam Brito I'm glad someone has to guts to stand up for a great ballplayer during this witch hunt.† The whole steroid thing is so overblown.† I'm glad they are banning it but they're not banning having big muscles and you can get that in a gym but steroids gets you there faster.† The athletes will be healthier so that is good, but Mickey Mantle was great due to his muscles and so were many greats but that was before steroids but those guys used uppers to keep their strength up during games, expecially pitchers. @ Richard Mulvaney Why do you say his suspension should not have been greater? He is a 3 time cheat...2001-2003, 2006 and three plus years with Biogenesis. He also took a 3 drug regimen and tried to obbstruct the MLB investigation. All of the items are greater than any of the other players who gladly signed up for their medicine. @ Richard Mulvaney Get in shape? How can he get in shape when he will be tested regularly during the year long suspension, when he has to get off the juice for a year his loss of muscle mass will make him look like a senior citizen. He already has lost the ability to catch up with the fastball and now without juice he won't be a legitimate hitter at all. He is faded and doomed to irrelevancy and he can now also kiss the HOF goodbye. Had he not challenged the proposed idea of the inevitable suspension to begin with he would not have gotten himself into the obstruction mess. Therefore the 211 games originally imposed may have been no more than 65 games or so. Seems like he bargained himself to more than double of what he might have gotten. @ Jeppydog I don't think you get the main point. Steroids gets you there by cheating and obtaining an advantage over other players who are also trying to make a living.

274,"With media attention focused on Chris Christie and Bridgegate, it was easy to miss a more important Washington story last week. The other shoe dropped on the Obama presidency. Still battered at home by the ObamaCare debacle and the permanently sluggish economy, the last thing the White House wanted was bad news on foreign policy. But thatís exactly what it got, and then some, thanks to the shockingly scathing book by Robert Gates. The former defense secretary offers the most devastating critique to come from an Obama insider. He paints the president as estranged from the very Afghan military surge he ordered and suspicious of and hostile toward top leaders of the armed forces. Gates is especially critical of Vice President Joe Biden, writing that he has been ìwrong on nearly every major foreign-policy and national-security issue over the past four decades.î He blames Biden and others for leading Obama to believe that military leaders were giving the president ìthe bumís rushî in seeking more troops in Afghanistan in 2009, according to excerpts. ìSuspicion and distrust of senior military officers by senior White House officials ó including the president and vice president ó became a big problem for me,î Gates writes. Hillary Rodham Clinton also comes off as a craven politician, with Gates saying he witnessed Clinton confess to Obama that she opposed the 2007 Iraq surge because she thought it would help her 2008 presidential campaign. The book, set for release this week, carries extra sting because Gates is a widely respected team player who served presidents from both parties. The former head of the CIA, he led the Pentagon under George W. Bush and Obama. His status as a kind of one-man blue-ribbon panel makes it impossible to refute his charges. The result is that the existing image of Obama as incompetent on domestic policies is now twinned with one of incompetence abroad. And those views are rapidly hardening into fixed conventional wisdom. The implications are enormous for the three years left in his term. ìIt makes him even more of a lame duck,î says Ed Rollins, a GOP wise man . He says Obama, whose approval number is stuck at about 40 percent, wonít be welcome to campaign for most Democrats during this yearís election. ìMost will say, ëThanks but no thanks, just send the money,í<U+2009>î Rollins adds. And Obamaís lack of commitment to the war on terror is something our enemies already figured out and are exploiting. Longtime al Qaeda expert Peter Bergen pulls together disturbing developments previously reported only in piecemeal fashion. ìFrom around Aleppo in western Syria to small areas of Falluja in central Iraq, al Qaeda now controls territory that stretches more than 400 miles across the heart of the Middle East,î Bergen writes for CNN, and adds, ìAl Qaeda appears to control more territory in the Arab world than it has done at any time in its history.î Others note that borders are being erased as terror groups carve out safe havens in several countries. Even The New York Times took a rare break from its propaganda approach to Obama, seeing a ìpower vacuumî and ìa post-American Middle East in which no broker has the power, or the will, to contain the regionís sectarian hatreds.î It later added a frightening note, reporting that intelligence officials say Syrian Islamists are trying to recruit Americans to carry out terror attacks here. This ìparade of horriblesî largely reflects a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia for Muslim supremacy that is spreading because Obama has abdicated global leadership. Adding a nuclear-armed Iran to the dangerous mix is a terrifying prospect to many in the region. But not to worry, the administration is on the case. Secretary of State John Kerry paid his 10th visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories in a frantic, and relatively pointless, effort to get a peace treaty. And President Obama returned from his 17-day, $4 million vacation in Hawaii and promptly denounced income inequality. On Friday, the Justice Department said it would recognize gay marriage in Utah, even though the state doesnít. And the band played on. De Blasio offers few ideas for education reform. ìI do not believe in, for example, merit pay,î Mayor de Blasio declared. And so the list of things heís against grows, while the list of education policies he supports remains a mystery. Heís against charters and closing failing schools. He pledges to stop grading schools and wants to curtail the use of standardized tests to measure students and teachers. The teachers union holds those same positions. The new mayorís opposition to merit pay stands in stark contrast to fellow Democrat Gov. Cuomo, who advanced the idea in his State of the State address. Cuomo wants to offer bonuses of up to $20,000 for teachers who receive top marks, with money coming from a Teacher Excellence Fund he would create. Meanwhile, de Blasioís only educational initiative, a push for universal pre-kindergarten and tax hikes to fund it, is irrelevant to everything that happens for the school systemís 1 million students. He is so far out of the bipartisan reform movement that he had to coax the 70-year-old Carmen FariÒa out of retirement to be chancellor. She spent 40 years in the system, and the nicest thing that can be said is that she knows how it works. Over her career, she was not credited with any historic breakthroughs or big achievements. Thanks to her fat pension and salary, she will be paid $412,000 this year. Her lone major comment is that she wants to focus on improving middle schools, hardly a new idea. Then again, at least she has an idea, which puts her ahead of her boss. Federal Promise Zone program adds bureaucracy to cut through bureaucracy. Hereís how Big Government gets bigger. It needs somebody to cut through the bureaucracy it already created. Officials told reporters that a program involving ìPromise Zonesî in poor urban areas wonít bring new money. Instead, it would give local governments ìaid in cutting through red tape to get access to existing resources.î It makes too much sense to just eliminate the red tape once and for all.

A lawyer accused the officers of ìracial profiling,î and NuÒez is dismissing charges, saying cops had no reason to search other than a hunch the men were criminals.

275,"Mayor Bloomberg has donned a hardhat countless times as he framed his greatest legacy: the city itself. Photo: NY Post composite. New York City comprises five very different boroughs, but Michael Bloomberg dreamed of a single, shimmering metropolis ó one of skyscrapers where none stood before; of desolate neighborhoods brought back to life; of moribund waterfronts teeming anew; and of a magical park on a trestle where steam locomotives once delivered beef and grain. In 12 years, he made much of his vision a reality. ìThe Bloomberg legacy is going to be part of New York for the next 50 years because he changed the physical landscape,î says NYU urban policy and planning authority Mitchell Moss. ìSo much of our land was undervalued, and he gave it value.î That he accomplished it despite the catastrophic economic impact of 9/11, the 2008 Wall Street crash and Hurricane Sandy makes it more remarkable. Unlike Robert Moses, Bloomberg didnít bulldoze homes. But he wielded a ruthless hand on the levers of mayoral clout, tempered by more respect for the way New Yorkers live, work and play than his numbers-driven techno-speak might suggest. He brought no particular urban-planning ideology, but only common sense, to the task of remaking New York for the 21st century. Yet it was ferocious common sense, reinforced by a steel will and a $25 billion personal fortune, which freed him from placating special interests. It will take years, if not generations, to fully perceive what the whirlwind wrought. This is not merely because the changes are many and vast to how neighborhoods and the communities they serve function. The larger imponderable is: How will all the pieces of the puzzle fit together as part of the new urban fabric? By now, Bloombergís credits can sound like old news: nearly 40 percent of city land rezoned, often (although far from always) to allow larger new buildings. Since 2001, 40,000 new structures, 170,000 new housing units, 450 miles of bike lanes, nearly 1,000 acres of new parks. Or forget statistics and use your eyes. Stand in the middle of Columbus Circle, once a traffic nightmare and camp for the homeless. Time Warner Center was under way before Bloomberg took office, but everything else owes its existence or pristine condition to his administration. The sparkling Museum of Arts & Design came into being when the city sold off crumbling 2 Columbus Circle. The streamlined traffic flow and landscaped oasis in the circleís once-forbidding center are a product of the Department of Transportation and other agencies. The radiant restoration of Art Deco 240 Central Park South by its owners followed its 2002 designation as a protected city landmark. Bloomberg had made his fortune on Wall Street and in technology, and understood those businesses as none of his predecessors did. He had no sentimental attachment to abandoned ìmanufacturingî districts. Yet City Hall had allowed precious parcels of all five boroughs to remain zoned as if we were still the factory town of 1950. Bloombergís 120 different rezoning measures brought forth new hotels in the dying West 30s, modest commercial regeneration in the Bronx, and modern apartment buildings along the desolate Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Long Island City waterfronts. His Economic Development Corporation built the great High Line Park. Bloomberg utilized tax benefits and † infrastructure investment to get two mighty † endeavors off the ground: Hudson Yards, where an 80-story office tower is under way for Coach Inc. and LíOreal, and Atlantic Yards, where Barclays Center† symbolizes the ìnewî Brooklyn. Not every Bloomberg action clicked right out of the gate. Brooklynís Fourth Avenue, a backwater of auto repair shops, was rezoned in 2003 to allow new apartment buildings up to 12 stories tall. But the measure neglected to require them to include retail uses. Then the recession stalled some projects before they got off the ground ó yielding a staccato procession of boxy, charmless new structures without stores or cafes. Yet those buildings quickly filled with residents. The city later fine-tuned the zoning to include stores and restaurants, and the delayed ventures are roaring back to life. In Times Square, too, Bloomberg secured the territory first and left the fine points for later. However popular with tourists, the asphalt pedestrian plazas are unworthy of their iconic location. But a $45 million redesign to replace their schoolyard surfaces with twinkling, light-reflective concrete will make all the difference, judging by the first stage now under way. Yet, while Bloomberg opened up many precincts to growth, he severely inhibited it in others. This is a less recognized part of his legacy. He imposed fresh limits on construction in more low-rise residential neighborhoods than he up-zoned, from Williamsbridge/Baychester in the Bronx to remote corners of the Rockaways. Preserving districts where dramatic transformation surely would otherwise have occurred is itself a kind of transformation. Bloombergís Landmarks Commission established 32 percent more historic districts ó where the panel micro-manages what may be built ó than existed before. On the Upper West Side and in the West Village, nearly 70 percent of all buildings are now covered by individual landmark or historic-district protection. Bloomberg the tower- and condo-builder was also the greatest preservationist of them all. Will the appeal of waterfront living in Williamsburg and Hunters Point diminish the desirability of those neighborhoodsí traditional dwelling grounds? Will the† ìSkyscraper Historic Districtî on Brooklynís Court Street, which preserved a bunch of weathered old office buildings, prove a boon or a blight to neighboring brownstone communities? Also, Bloomberg left one piece of crucial unfinished business: his aborted attempt to rezone East Midtown, a ìpremierî but increasingly obsolescent office district astride Park Avenue where buildings average 70 years old. He waited until it was too late. So it was cut down in a buzzsaw of ìcommunityî resistance over density and infrastructure. But that rare blunder will likely be remedied by Bill de Blasio or his successor. The myriad gifts Bloomberg bestowed on the cityscape will be remembered more than the one he couldnít quite deliver. The new New York he made, from Riverdale to Coney Island, is just being born ó a hint of the full-blown Bloombubble which our children, and our childrenís children, will behold. FIDI. Photo: EPA. The mayor got off to a weak start in Lower Manhattan, at first objecting to commercial reconstruction and ceding control of the area post-9/11 to then-Gov. George Pataki. But one of his first steps in office was crucial: He killed the NYSEís plan for a 60-story tower in the middle of Wall Street, a project which made no sense in the digital age. That signal from City Hall helped open up FiDi to its residential boom. In 2006, Bloomberg brokered a deal between the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein over new World Trade Center towers that finally allowed major construction to start. He rescued the faltering Memorial with his own funds and by twisting bankersí arms to pony up as well. City incentives lured a swelling tide of technology companies to older office buildings. LONG ISLAND CITY WATERFRONT. Photo: Getty Images. In LICís Hunterís Point section, Bloomberg created an entirely new neighborhood along the post-industrial East River waterfront ó one of several he set in motion in Brooklyn and Queens. The Economic Development Corp. in 2012 opened the Hunterís Point South Waterfront Park, a five-acre open space on the full 30-acre site that will eventually boast 5,000 new apartments, 60 percent of them ìaffordable.î The city spent $66 million to build the park and related infrastructure. HIGHLINE/CHELSEA. Photo: NY Post: Brian Zak. Bloomberg spared the crumbling old train trestle from demolition (for which permits had been issued) and in 2002 embraced the idea of turning it into a park. The city paid most of its $152 million construction cost and built it. In 2005, Bloomberg rezoned neighboring West Chelsea to exploit the parkís magnetic pull years before it was opened. The moves catalyzed well over $20 billion in new development, much of it in architecturally compelling apartment buildings but also in dramatic adaptive re-uses, such as the Avenues World School in a former grocery warehouse. BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK. Photo: Brian Zak. Bloomberg was instrumental in creating the public-private partnership behind this 85-acre jewel of greenery at the foot of the bridge and the edge of the thriving and growing Dumbo neighborhood. When completed, it will stretch from the foot of Atlantic Avenue to the Manhattan Bridge. The city contributed about half of the $350 million for infrastructure upgrades on rotting piers and lawns. Bloomberg also stimulated private-sector apartment and hotel projects nearby that will help pay for the parkís upkeep and security. BARCLAYS CENTER. Photo: Getty Images. Although state condemnation was the prime mover behind Atlantic Yards, the city played a prominent role as well. Bloomberg gave a generous tax subsidy to developer Bruce Ratner. He lent the prestige of his office to the controversial project, which had to overcome years of lawsuits. Rezoning of several neighborhoods around the sports and entertainment mecca liberated them from decades of neglect. Barclaysí arrival inspired a store and restaurant boom on all sides. The worldís tallest prefab apartment tower, now rising behind the arena, is being assembled at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the former shipbuilding complex thatís now a thriving industrial park thanks to massive city investment under Bloomberg. A WHEEL DEAL? Photo: Office of the Mayor of New York. The Staten Island Wheel will be a towering testament to Bloombergís vision. Rising 625 feet over the St. George waterfront, the elegant, lacy structure would be the worldís tallest Ferris wheel. Scheduled to break ground in 2014 and open in 2016, itís part of a planned $580 million complex near the ferry terminal to also include a 350,000-square-foot Empire Outlets shopping mall. Both projects received all city approvals. However, the state last week declined to provide an economic development grant to the Wheel, which has a different development team than the Outlets.

276,"One of the nationís leading energy-industry executives is blasting Gov. Cuomo for denying upstate New Yorkers thousands of jobs with his ìshortsightedíí refusal to permit drilling for natural gas. American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard also accused Cuomo of hiding ìfor far too longíí behind the ìexcuseíí of conducting a health study on the safety of fracking for natural gas when its safety has already been proven in some 30 states across the nation. ìI think itís shortsighted, I think itís unfortunate because it hurts his state. It hurts economic development in his state,íí Gerard told The Post. ìWe need to go back to facts and reality,íí he continued. ìThe director of the [Environmental Protection Agency] .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. the secretary of energy today, the secretary of the interior today, have all reaffirmed the fact that hydraulic fracturing can be done in a safe and effective way that protects the workforce and protects the environment,íí continued Gerard, whose institute represents virtually all major gas and oil companies in the nation, including ExxonMobil and Shell, and sets the industry standards for the equipment used in the energy field. A spokesman for Gerard, Reid Porter, told The Post that neither Cuomo nor the state Department of Health, which the governor claims has been conducting a health study on fracking for nearly a year, has sought any information about the drilling technique from API or any of its member companies. While Cuomo claims heís trying to make New York business-friendly, an authoritative oil-and-gas industry source involved in Pennsylvania-based energy production told The Post the governor has repeatedly rejected offers of information on fracking from leading energy companies, which are prepared to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on gas exploration in the state. Whatís more, the source said, Cuomo has turned down offers to tour ongoing fracking operations just across the New York border in Pennsylvania and, in at least one case, ìinsultedî a major energy- company president by not even responding to a formal letter requesting a meeting on the gas-drilling issue with the governor. ìCuomo says he wants New York to be business-friendly, and this is how he treats the president of a leading international company?î asked a second source. Cuomo, the target of repeated threats of political retaliation from environmental activists, including his former brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy Jr., has repeatedly refused for more than three years to approve fracking in the gas-rich Marcellus Shale region of the Southern Tier ó even as President Obama backed the practice and state Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joseph Martens proclaimed it could be done safely. Last February, just as a final report on the safety of fracking was due to be released by Martensí agency, Cuomo abruptly announced that his health commissioner, Dr. Nirav Shah, would conduct a last-minute study, which Shah promised would be completed in ìweeks.íí Since then, both Cuomo and Shah have repeatedly refused to say when the report would be finished. While energy-company executives initially believed Cuomo would stick to his campaign promise to make a decision based on the ìscience and the facts,íí theyíve long since concluded that political considerations ó including a possible run for the presidency in 2016 ó have determined his stance. That view was reinforced by two developments last week: Cuomoís aides proposed a new energy plan for the stateís future that, unlike previous plans, made no mention of fracking in the Southern Tier, and Cuomo himself named former New York City Councilman James Gennaro, a fierce fracking opponent, as a deputy commissioner at Martensí environmental agency.",Cuomo ripped for stalling on fracking | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/13/cuomo-ripped-for-stalling-on-fracking/

They get five weeksí holiday every year.íí (How many people get that much down time?) ìTourists love them.î He speculated that efforts to ban the carriage trade resulted from a land grab by greedy developers eager to get hold of horse stables on Manhattanís West Side. ìI think itís about real estate. Iím not the kind of person to use my celebrityíí to promote causes, he said. But, ìthe horses are happy.î ìDonít you agree, darliní?íí Be still my heart. Liam warned that the lives of these graceful animals, who weigh between 1,000 and 2,000 pounds apiece, will be cut short if the horses get pink-slipped. ìSomeone is going to take the horses in?

Liamís loyalty to the carriage industry puts him at odds with de<U+2009>Blasio, who at a press conference two days before his Jan. 1 mayoral inauguration delivered these fighting words: ìWe are going to quickly and aggressively move to make horse carriages no longer part of the landscape in New York City. They are not humane. Itís over.íí It also puts him in the cross hairs of many nitwit celebrities, from actors Alec Baldwin and Mary Tyler Moore to singers Miley Cyrus and Pink, who point to isolated incidents ó including the case of a horse who got spooked last September and bolted through the streets, upending his carriage on the West Side and sending two tourists to the hospital ó as proof that the city is no place for horses. Warbler Lea Michele of TVís ìGlee,íí who speaks for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told me in 2011 that an industry claim that carriage horses lead good lives ìis the most blasphemous thing Iíve ever heard!íí But Liam, who counts carriage drivers as some of his closest friends, isnít one to cave to Hollywood hysterics. ìSome of these celebrities,íí he told me with contempt, ìare ill-informed. They should visit the stables and see how comfortable the horses are, and talk to the drivers.íí In these days replete with girly-boys, the ìSchindlerís Listíí and ìLove Actuallyíí star may be the last true Hollywood he-man, favoring roles that reveal both his macho side and his sensitive inner core.

Liam, who works nonstop, will soon start promoting his latest flick: ìNon-Stop.íí De Blasio, who presumably wishes no harm on horses, favors a plan by New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets ó NYCLASS ó to replace carriage horses with ridiculous antique-style electric cars.

On Tuesday, she showed up at 3:30 p.m. On Wednesday, The Post found her at home in Westbury, LI, all day before emerging at 2:50 p.m. ó school dismissal time. Wearing a fur coat, she took her BMW for a spin. She showed up at school Thursday, but not Friday. When Sills, 48, does go to work, itís rarely before 11<U+2009>a.m. ó and often hours later, say sources familiar with her schedule. ìShe strolls in whenever she wants,î one said. The school hasnít had a payroll secretary in years. A Department of Education spokesman said Sills was required to report her absences and tardiness to District 27 Superintendent Michelle Lloyd-Bey but would not say whether Sills did so last week. Lloyd-Bey did not return a call. Sills hung up on a reporter. When she is out, an assistant principal is left in charge. Yet Sills, who gets a $128,207 salary, also pockets overtime pay ó $2,900 for 83 hours in 2011, the latest available records show. ìThis school is a complete s-<U+200A>-thole, but nobody in a position of power comes to investigate.

The floods of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 wrecked a hangar-like annex, called the Early Childhood Academy, which housed pre-K, kindergarten and first and second grades. It has not been repaired. Two kindergarten classes moved into ìtemporary classroom unitsî in the yard. The other children moved into the main building, forcing some classes to squeeze into small offices and storage rooms. The pre-K class sits in the auditorium, but has to move to the cafeteria during the movies. Kids in several grades said that last week they watched ìFat Albert,î ìAlvin and the Chipmunksî and ìMonsters, Inc.,î but did not relish the downtime. ìI like gym. I like to draw,î said Charm Russell, 10, who added her peers are too restless and bored to watch the screen. ìTheyíre always making noise, and thereís nothing entertaining going on. No art, no gym, no music class.î More alarming, the teachers have gotten no curricula since Sandy. Last February, the DOE announced several new options, including ìGo Mathî for grades K-5, and ìReadyGenî or the state Education Departmentís ìCore Knowledgeî for English language arts. The books cover the Common Core standards, skills that kids should master at each level. But five months into the school year, PS 106 classes still donít have the books or teacherís guides. ìThey have no reading program, no math program,î a source said, adding Sills blames outside administrators for not sending materials. Teachers muddle through by printing out worksheets they find online, buying their own copy paper. The DOE gave no explanation for the missing curricula but said itís ìworking with the school to provide students with physical education.î A spokesman denied the trailers are rat-infested. Staffers wonít speak up or even file a grievance with their union because Sills will retaliate, a source said. Parents wonder if higher-ups know whatís going on. ìWhy donít they get on them?

Two unpaid loans to murder victim Menachem ìMaxî Stark and his business partner Israel ìSamî Perlmutter were among 17 bad bets that spelled $104<U+2009>million in losses for Chicagoís Broadway Bank before it was shut down by the feds in 2010, court papers show. The loans included $1.5 million Broadway gave Stark and Perlmutter in December 2007 through their Southside House LLC business ìto provide working capital for the borrowersí New York-based real-estate business,î according to a 2012 suit filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The one-year, interest-only loan was secured by a second mortgage on a 74-unit apartment building in Williamsburg that Stark and Perlmutter bought for $29 million earlier in 2007, the Chicago federal court filing says. But Broadway lost any chance of getting repaid when Stark and Perlmutter ìdefaulted on the first mortgage,î the suit says. Stark and Perlmutter also borrowed $6.2 million in construction money from Broadway in February 2007 to develop The Bedford Lofts in South Williamsburg, even though financial statements revealed ìthey were highly illiquid and unable to pay the loan,î the suit says. Broadway Bank was run by Demetris and George Giannoulias, brothers of former Illinois state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias.

281,"RENTON, Wash. ó Russell Wilson thinks itís ìpretty coolíí a new food item specially created for Sundayís NFC Championship Game was inspired by his own taste buds and will be available for purchase at CenturyLink Field when the Seahawks face the 49ers in an NFC West grudge match. Wilson figured the ìDangeRuss Dogíí had to in some way involve macaroni and cheese, as thatís a particular favorite of his. StillÖ ìI never really thought of a mac-and-cheese hot dog,î he said Wednesday. That means for $12 those in attendance can test the inner-workings of their digestive systems as Wilson and Colin Kaepernick ó two of the NFLís most visible new-age quarterbacks, athletes who can run it and throw it and make a defense look silly ó engage in a high-stakes duel, for the right to play in the first new York/New Jersey Super Bowl. If the AFC title game is classic music ó supreme pocket passers Peyton Manning and Tom Brady orchestrating traditional passing attacks ó in the NFC it is improvisational jazz as Wilson and Kaepernick play to a different beat. ìIn terms of Colinís ability to run the football and throw the football extremely well, and my ability to throw the ball and run it, itís one of those things that I believe the quarterback position is changing a little bit,íí Wilson said. ìYou have some guys that can move around and make plays, but also there are still the Tom Bradys of the world that rip the defense by just sitting there in the pocket and throwing it all day and getting the ball out and all that. So itís pretty cool.î Wilson has been more than pretty cool ever since he stepped into the spotlight as a rookie sensation and heís no less intriguing as a second-year phenom. Wilsonís performance from one year to the next were almost identical ó he started all 16 games both seasons and had a quarterback rating of 100.0 in 2012 and 101.2 in 2013. But the passing game he directs has not done a whole lot since he threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns in a rout of the Saints in Week 13. In his last four regular-season games, Wilson passed for 200 yards only once ó and that was 206 yards in a routine victory over the Giants. Last week, in the rain and wind, Wilsonís arm wasnít much of a factor in a 23-15 playoff victory over the Saints, as he completed only nine of his 18 passes for 103 yards and no touchdowns. ìObviously, last game was one of those things, all the circumstances and all that, Marshawn [Lynch] was running for 150 yards, why wouldnít you keep giving it to him?íí Wilson said. Indeed, with Lynch rushing for 140 yards and two touchdowns the Seahawks didnít have to take any chances on offense, but coach Pete Carroll acknowledged heís heard the rumblings perhaps Wilson is not as sharp as he needs to be. ìI know there is a lot of talk about that,íí Carroll said. ìIím not that worried about it.íí Wilson does not appear to be very worried about it, either. ìI think the biggest thing is be more accurate on a couple throws I normally make,íí he said. ìThatís what it comes down to. Itís nothing I need to search deep down for or go study a whole bunch for. Itís just put the ball on the money right where you need to be.íí Thereís a good chance Wilson will be without receiver Percy Harvin, who sustained a concussion last week and has not yet been cleared to practice. Harvin played in only one game during the regular season, returned to catch three passes last week against the Saints before he was forced out just before halftime.","Seahawksí Wilson out to devour 49ers, NFC title | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/seahawks-wilson-out-to-devour-49ers-nfc-title/
282,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. ó ìHow will the Patriots ever replace him?î was all the rage around these parts when Wes Welker bolted for the Broncos in free agency last spring. The answer: Quite easily, it turns out. The Patriots had no shortage of concerns hanging over their heads going into this season, but replacing Welker is no longer one of them as New England prepares to renew acquaintances with the NFLís most prolific slot receiver in Denver on Sunday in the AFC Championship Game. Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola, and to a lesser extent running back Shane Vereen, have more than made up for the gaping hole in receiving production left when Welker spurned the Patriotsí offer to return and signed with Denver. Edelman recorded a career- and team-high 105 catches for 1,056 yards and six touchdowns in the regular season, while Amendola ó the injury-prone former Ram ó added 54 receptions for 633 yards and two scores and Vereen emerged as a fearsome receiving weapon out of the backfield with 47 catches for 427 yards and three touchdowns. That trio hasnít slowed down in the postseason, either combining for 11 receptions for 177 yards ó including a 53-yard grab by Amendola ó in the Patriotsí 43-22 rout of the Colts in the divisional round last week. Just donít expect them to brag about practically making Welker a distant memory in New England, even after he led the NFL in receptions in three of the previous six seasons before signing with Denver. Asked if it was satisfying to quiet the skeptics about replacing Welker, Edelman danced around the question Wednesday. ìTo be truthful, we havenít really thought of that,î he said. ìThatís kind of been the mediaís thing. Weíre more worried on what we have to do, especially as an individual.î Thatís typical for the Patriots, who are always marching under strict orders from Bill Belichick to keep their responses limited to the team as a whole and the game at hand. That game this week would appear to offer even more opportunity for Edelman and the others to pile up big receiving numbers, considering the Broncosí secondary was already banged up before losing reliable cornerback Chris Harris to a knee injury last week. Denverís injury woes on defense were more interesting to Edelman than the fact Welker will be watching his replacements up close Sunday. ìWhat I have to do to prepare for the team weíre about to play, along with what I have to do to help the unit,î Edelman said of the Welker angle as a whole. ìSo Iím not really thinking about that.î What's Your Take? I don't agree that the Patriot's offense is not as good as last years offense. The difference is the offense has evolved once again. They are back to a running game offense. Have the most time of possession, and don't turn the ball over. They had Wes Welker, Randy Moss and Gronkowski. They did not win a SuperBowl by throwing the ball. So let's try winning a Super Bowl someday by running the ball.

283,"MORE ON: It now looks like ObamaCare will hurt twice as many people as it helps ó because the law isnít nearly done with canceling peopleís insurance. The 5 million-plus Americans whoíve seen their health plans canceled thanks to ObamaCare will be joined by millions more this year ó because the Affordable Care Act makes their employer-provided policies illegal, as well. ObamaCare defenders are trying to minimize the coming pain. Jonathan Gruber, an architect of the law, told The Washington Post that the number of ìlosersî who will have to pay more for the same or inferior coverage will be ìvery, very small.î Nonsense. ObamaCare exchange plans ó the only option for most people who lose on-the-job coverage ó are a raw deal. Yet millions will get dropped from employer-provided coverage over the course of this year and be stuck with that alternative. Effective Jan. 1 of this year, the Affordable Care Act requires small-group plans to provide 10 ìessential benefits.î Many employers renewed their plans late last year to avoid that costly requirement as long as possible. But as the months pass, these plans will expire ó and employers will be tempted to drop coverage altogether, rather than pay for those costly added benefits. And those dropped employees will be stuck with ObamaCare-exchange plans or no insurance at all. Yet an exchange plan is a ripoff compared with what theyíre losing. On average, US workers with on-the-job individual coverage contribute $999 a year in pre-tax dollars and have a deductible of $1,135, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. On ObamaCare exchanges, all but the lowest earners will pay more (even after subsidies), pay with after-tax dollars, face deductibles of $3,000 to $5,000 for silver and bronze plans and lose access to many doctors and hospitals theyíre covered for now. How many people will this change clobber? Well, about 60 million Americans now get employer-provided insurance via small-group plans. Law firms and other high-end businesses are unlikely to drop coverage, but companies with lots of salespeople, receptionists and other lower-paid workers will say they canít afford Washingtonís ìone size fits allî requirement ó which, the Heritage Foundation reports, adds an estimated $1.79 an hour to the cost of a 40-hour worker (and more than $2 an hour in states like New York and New Jersey, where health care is more expensive). Even the chance that ObamaCareís ìemployer mandateî will go into effect in 2015 isnít apt to deter employers from dropping coverage. The penalty for not complying with the mandate would add only 98 cents an hour for a 40-hour worker ó a bargain compared with the $1.79 cost of providing coverage plus the enormous amount of red tape, reporting requirements and fees that ObamaCare piles on employers who provide coverage. In truth, the law discourages employers from insuring their workers, making it far easier and cheaper to send them to the exchanges. Thatís why the management consultants at McKinsey & Co. warned in 2011 that nearly a third of employers surveyed already were considering dropping coverage, with the figure rising among those familiar with the lawís requirements. So a conservative estimate is that 25 million people, out of the 60 million in small group plans, get dropped in 2014. Add that to the 5 million or so whose individual-market already canceled on Jan. 1, and you have a lot of losers. Indeed, it looks like ObamaCare will create twice as many losers as winners in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 16 million will gain coverage via the lawís Medicaid expansion (9 million) and subsidized exchange plans (7 million) ó and even thatís rosier than the enrollment figures weíve seen so far. Thirty million losing insurance; 16 million gaining it. Itíll be hard for Democrats running for election this fall to defend a law that hurts twice as many people as it helps.",Another 25 million ObamaCare victims | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/another-25-million-obamacare-victims/
284,"MOVIE REVIEW. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. In ìJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,î we learn that Greenwich Villageís lefty haven Film Forum is the favorite place in town for CIA agents to swap files, which is as I always suspected. Next weíll hear about how Rumsfeld and Cheney plotted the Iraq War from the restrooms at CBGB, and itís well known that Henry Kissinger frequented Studio 54, which is where he and Cher first got the idea to manufacture the oil crisis. Despite the occasional hard-to-believe moment, the reboot of the 1990s franchise (later doomed by Ben Affleck, before the next ìBatmanî turns him into a serial franchise killer) is soundly structured, smart and fast, with a plausible central scenario, several gripping moments and well-wrought dialogue. If it isnít quite as gritty or intelligent as the Bourne movies it is ó as Ryan responds when asked if heís still ìintactî after nearly taking a few unexpected bullets ó close enough. ìJack Ryanî is also ó a major point of relief with me ó considerably less frivolous than most of the Bond and ìMission: Impossibleî films about what it might be like to be an international man of mystery. If the star can brush everything off without even unknotting his tie, and crack jokes as he goes, so much for intensity. And Chris Pine is much less blockish here than in ìStar Trek,î with his callow quality serving him well as an often-terrified newbie economics Ph.D. and ex-Marine combatant recruited by a CIA operative (Kevin Costner) to follow terrorismís money trail while undercover at a Wall Street firm. Under pressure, Pine gets red-faced and sweats instead of quips as his investigation of Russian banking transactions leads him to a cold-blooded Moscow financier (a chilling Kenneth Branagh, also the filmís director) who is engineering a simultaneous 9/11-style bombing and financial attack. Jackís girlfriend Cathy (Keira Knightley), the doctor who helped him recover after he was nearly killed fighting in Afghanistan, thinks heís having an affair when she finds that Film Forum ticket stub and declines to marry him out of general suspicion ó but he canít tell anyone but his spouse about his secret life, so she canít know. Even when she finds a firearm in his room, though, she considers that evidence of cheating, which seems obtuse in a feminine way: Honey, your man needs only one pistol to fool around, not two. Knightley, though occasionally annoying (her patented gape-smile is getting old), anchors perhaps the best scene in the movie when, having been drawn into the plot, she must divert Branaghís Cherevin by talking about Russian literature while her boyfriend downloads every villainous file from the evil mainframe. Sheís a doctor, not a kickboxer, and the movie doesnít burn off credibility by giving her ridiculous stunts, while the tender moments with Jack lay down a solid foundation for him to risk it all and tear after her in one of the admirably few, but potent, action scenes. Keeping things nimble and clever (the financial scam makes scary sense, and how many blockbusters seamlessly work in themes from novelist Mikhail Lermontov?) brings the director total redemption after the unfortunate, nearly campy ìThor.î Branagh, that recovering Shakespearean, now looks like a reliable hand at le cinema du popcorn. Equal credit goes to the script ó based on Tom Clancyís characters ó by newcomer Adam Cozad and veteran David Koepp (ìJurassic Parkî). An exchange worthy of John le CarrÈ comes when Jack mentions he hurt his back in Afghanistan and Cherevin says icily, ìMe too.î Two words tie together two eras and make clear why Cherevin hates America, for its support of the rebels during the Soviet invasion. Perhaps an even better line is the Costner characterís response to Ryanís mildly insane (but perfectly correct) series of computations that lead to the conclusion that thereís a sleeper agent in Pennsylvania. Nah, says Costner: ìNobody blows up Pennsylvania.î",Smart and fast ëJack Ryan: Shadow Recruití entertains | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/smart-and-fast-jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-entertains/
285,"ItíS going to be a few months before we get a clear idea of who the combatants will be at the Tony Awards, but thereís one category thatís quickly coming into focus ó Best Actress in a Musical. Broadway insiders already are gaming the five divasí prospects, even before theyíve seen them all perform. First out of the gate is the weekís sensation, Jessie Mueller, who gives a restrained and tender performance as Carole King in ìBeautiful.î The critics are decidedly mixed on the show ó for what itís worth, I think itís better than they do ó but all agree itís Mueller time. (Boy, was that a groaner!) Mueller was the only redeeming feature in the dreadful revival of ìOn a Clear Day You Can See Foreverî a couple of years ago, and with ìBeautiful,î sheís emerged as a genuine Broadway leading lady. A lot of people think sheís the one to beat, though a few say sheíll have to overcome the hurdle of starring in a jukebox musical that may not find favor with the Tony nominators. Next up will be criticsí darling Kelli OíHara in ìThe Bridges of Madison County,î which opens Feb. 20. OíHaraís never gotten a bad review, managing even to survive two Frank Wildhorn shows, ìJekyll & Hydeî and ìDracula, the Musical.î Sheís received four Tony nominations but has never won ó which could swing it in her favor. On the other hand, some insiders believe she may be miscast as Francesca, a lonely Italian woman living in Iowa. Somehow, OíHara and pasta fagioli donít quite fit. Our third contender will likely be Idina Menzel in ìIf/Then,î the new musical from ìNext to Normalî creators Brian Yorkey and Tom Kitt. Peter Marks of the Washington Post praised her performance during the out-of-town tryout, saying she was ìravishing even in white tops and skinny jeans.î (Easy, Peter.) And she gives the showís power ballads her customary full-throated treatment. Menzel famously knocked off her ìWickedî co-star Kristin Chenoweth for the Tony in 2004. Menzel should never be underestimated. Sutton Foster received raves for her performance as a disfigured woman in Jeanine Tesoriís ìVioletî at City Center last summer (ìtransfixing performance,î said Stephen Holden of the Times). Sheíll be reprising the role in April at the Roundabout Theatre Company. Foster already has two Tonys, and frankly, for a long time I thought of her as an over-peppy tap-dancing machine. But sheís matured greatly as an actress, and this role is one of the most demanding in contemporary musical theater. Last but not least: splendid film actress Michelle Williams, whoís tackling Sally Bowles in ìCabaret,î also for the Roundabout. Sheís come a long way since ìDawsonís Creek,î and though sheís never done a musical, this is a part that requires serious acting chops. The late, great Natasha Richardson was no Julie Andrews in the singing department, but she acted the hell out of those Kander and Ebb songs in the 1998 revival ó and she won a Tony Award to prove it.

The index fell by 2.1 per cent for November on a year-on-year basis, which was even sharper than October's decline of 1.6 per cent. Now all eyes are on inflation data due on Wednesday for the month of December. The BSE Sensex rallied over 400 points in intraday trade on Monday, led by smart buying seen in IT, banks, capital goods and oil & gas stocks.

However, most analysts rule out any major surprises from Q3 results considering the fact that the benefit of the currency which was there in the previous quarter might not be available in December quarter.

288,"KOLKATA: Apple is set to relaunch the 8GB version of the iPhone 4 in the Indian market after losing sales and market share in the middle segment to rival Samsung in the last quarter after pulling out the model as part of a global strategy. The US company, pressing hard to raise its market share in India, will price the device at around 15,000 through buyback and EMI schemes compared with its old retail price of Rs 26,500, Apple's four top trade partners in India said requesting anonymity due to confidentiality clauses. The model launched three years ago has been succeeded by the 4S, 5, 5c and 5s, the last of which starts at Rs 53,500. Since Apple stopped production of the iPhone 4 last August-September, the company is likely to source unsold inventory of the model from around the globe for the Indian market. However, this could not be independently verified. ""While there is still a latent demand for the iPhone 4 due to its attractive price in India, the model has lost favour in matured markets and hence it may not make sense for Apple to start fresh production since it follows economies of scale,"" said a senior executive at a top electronic retail chain. An email sent to the Apple spokesperson at regional headquarters in London did not elicit any response until press time on Monday. The company's decision to stop selling the 8GB iPhone 4 in the last quarter to push its latest devices helped the company gain value share but meant ceding ground in unit sales, with the 5c not reaching expected numbers and the company having no presence in the sub- 30,000 segment. ""Apple's iPhone 4 8GB model used to rank amongst the top three selling models by unit sales and fight neck and neck with Samsung, but with its exit the company lost much ground,"" said a senior executive at a top electronic retail. In his chain, which has more than a hundred stores, the iPhone4 used to account for almost 15-20% of sales compared with Samsung's 50% in the Rs15,000- Rs 20,000 segment, he said. Now Samsung has more than 70% share. Apple's market share in the Indian smartphone market peaked to more than 4% in October-December 2012 and January-March 2013 before dwindling to 1.4% in October 2013, according to CMR data. Samsung's share, in contrast, rose to 42% from 33% in the same period.

289,"KOLKATA: Tax-saving deposit schemes that banks expected would help channel public savings to the banking sector are facing a drought in demand, with the market getting crowded with financial products offering better tax benefits coupled with higher returns. Banks have also become reluctant to push tax-saving deposits, giving up on a scheme they had fought hard for and got approval some eight summers ago. Since 2006, up to 1 lakh deposited for five years in banks qualifies for deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. But retail tax-free bonds from state-run companies and instruments such as Public Provident Fund (PPF) and mutual funds are luring people away from tax-saving deposit schemes, say industry executives. ""The demand for this scheme remains low. We do not promote this as well,"" said Dena Bank executive director Trishna Guha. Senior executives from Allahabad Bank to United Bank of India confirmed this. The trend is similar across regions as savers have grown a habit of using banks for short-term investments while making long-term investments in instruments outside banks that offer higher yields. According to India Ratings & Research, deposits maturing in less than one year formed more than 45% of the total bank deposits in 2013. A significant portion of deposits had maturities of less than six months. Investments in mutual funds need to be locked up for three years to save on tax, while the minimum lock-in period for tax-saving bank deposits is longer at five years. For those who want to keep their money invested for longer periods, some public sector companies offer tax-free bonds with tenures as long as 20 years. According to investment experts, the annual yield on tax-free bonds from firms like National Housing Bank is better compared with tax-saving deposits. PPF investments, which are typically for long periods, also offer tax-free returns. United Bank of India, which is more active in the eastern sector, cites lack of tax-paying business activity in east for the lull it is witnessing. ""West Bengal is an economy driven by agriculture and small-scale units, where income is tax free. Therefore, there is not much demand for tax savings instruments in the rural belts. Even in Kolkata, mobilisation under tax-savings scheme is less,"" executive director Deepak Narang, said. In the South, Kerala-based South Indian Bank has shown a similar trend. Just about 0.4% of the bank's depositors go for the tax-saving scheme, a senior executive said.

Siva Surya Teja has truckloads of tenacity. In his previous three CAT attempts, he scored 89, 99 and 96 percentiles, respectively, but still couldn't make it into a top league B-School as he couldn't clear the sectional cutoffs in verbal ability and logical reasoning. This time around, he has scored 100 percentile. Born in Samalkot, Andhra Pradesh, this 24-year-old has been working in Infosys , Hyderabad as a systems engineer for the past two years. His father is a headmaster in agovernment school. Maths has always been Teja's strong suit ó he has been conducting mathematical shows for some time now. But English wasn't. ""I chalked out a strategy to maximise my strengths wherein I concentrated on logical reasoning and reading and comprehension so that I could clear the sectional cut-offs,"" he says. Teja is now setting his sights on IIM Ahmedabad. Abhiram Iyer. It is in his third attempt that Abhiram Iyer, 23, has managed a 100 percentile CAT score. The 23-year-old who works as a project planner at Ashok Leyland had done pretty well in his previous two attempts with scores of 99.4 and 98.99 percentiles. He was expecting a good score this time too, but didn't expect to be a topper. Iyer, who has a dual degree in mechanical engineering from IIT-Madras, didn't stress himself much, studying 5-6 hours a day after coming back from office. He took mock tests for each section every alternate day and would go through the paper and correct his mistakes the next day. His mother is a retired SBI manager and his father is an auditor in the Defence Accounts Department. He now wants to pursue his MBA from IIM-A. Anirudh Batra. Much of Anirudh Batra's preparations for CAT 2013 happened on his twice a day, hour-long commute on the Delhi Metro from his home in Delhi to his office in Noida and back. And that was enough for the 22-year old to top CAT. An electronics and instrumentation graduate from BITS Pilani, he works in Atrenta, an electronic design and automation company. His workdays typically begin at 9 AM and he returns home by 7 PM. Left with little time to prepare, he began carrying formula sheets and work sheets while commuting on the metro to his office. Having figured out his weakness ó verbal ability ó after his first attempt, he took extra care to not only try answering questions but go deeper and figure out different ways of answering the same. He would utilise his weekends for mock and sectional tests and dedicate weekdays to mostly reviewing these. His father is a vice president at Indraprastha Gas and mother teaches in a government school.",Three toppers who ëbelledí CAT 2013 with 100 percentile score - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/services/education/three-toppers-who-belled-cat-2013-with-100-percentile-score/articleshow/28811583.cms

293,"6 other Obamacare promises - and these are very much coming true. Opinion: Sally Kohn is a progressive activist, columnist and television commentator. Republicans recently pounced on the fact that, yes, some Americans will lose their current crummy insurance plans that don't meet the new standards set by the Affordable Care Act. These Republicans are accusing President Obama of having misled the American public -- or worse, having lied. I think that's a ridiculous claim. If you like your crummy plan, you can't keep your crummy plan under Obamacare, but odds are you will find a better plan that is also more affordable, with subsidies available to more than half of Americans. Aside from parsing this promise that you could keep your plan, it is wrong to say that this alone was how Obamacare was sold to the public. There were many promises -- and they are coming true with great benefits for millions of Americans. So here, for the record, are a few of the Affordable Care kept promises: 1. Millions of young Americans will get access to health car e by staying on their parents' plans. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 3.4 million young Americans now have coverage under their parents' insurance plans that they can stay on until age 26. 2. You will no longer be denied insurance because of a pre-existing condition . Insurance companies will provide coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, a provision that will benefit all Americans when it takes full effect in 2014. 3. Your insurance will no longer be cut off due to spending caps. Every American with insurance is now benefiting from the end of annual and lifetime spending caps, through which insurance companies would cut off payments in medical emergencies, thrusting millions of families into medical bankruptcy. 4. You will now be guaranteed much more comprehensive coverage . All insurance plans are required to cover 10 essential benefits , including mental health services, laboratory work and hospitalization. Preventative care is now free to every insured American. 5. The Affordable Care Act will cover millions of Americans who have lacked insurance . Rates of uninsured Americans are dropping, for instance by 10% in Oregon , and are likely to drop even further and faster, especially in those states that have expanded Medicaid access. But even people who don't qualify for Medicaid will find they can now afford insurance thanks to competitive rates in the exchanges and subsidies for which most seeking insurance will qualify. 6. The Affordable Care Act is projected to lower the deficit . According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, Obamacare will actually lower the deficit by $109 billion over the next decade. That's through a combination of cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates (which were not in line with other reimbursement rates) and new taxes. The point of this exercise: We have to compare all the developing evidence of Obamacare's successes, and challenges, to the reality of what existed before -- which stank. In 2009, 14,000 Americans were losing their health insurance every single day and medical debt accounted for over 60% of all bankruptcies . Every indication is that the Affordable Care Act will lower health care costs in America and raise the quality of care. As this chart reflects , there will certainly be a few people who see their costs go up under Obamacare ó but the vast majority of Americans will see no change or see their costs go down. And that's the point of legislation generally: Do the most good for the most number of people, and therefore do good for our nation in general. By that standard, so far, so good.","6 other Obamacare promises - and these are very much coming true - Nov. 4, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/04/news/economy/obamacare-kept-promises/index.html
294,"""Unemployment checks can help families cover their rent or mortgage payments, pay for utilities and transportation, and keep food on the table,"" said Julia Isaacs and Olivia Healy who co-authored the analysis. Poverty has tripled among parents who have not had a job for six months or more -- from 12 percent to 35 percent. Lately, the social impact of long-term unemployment is also gaining attention, especially after the monthly jobs report last week showed that many are losing heart and dropping out of the workforce. It affects children in other ways: their parent's job losses can lead to worse test scores and school performance. The risk a child will repeat a grade also goes up by 15% , according to a 2009 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. While still large, the number of children who live with long-term unemployed parents, has fallen since 2010 when it reached a high of 3.6 million. Federal benefits first went into effect during the recession in June 2008. It was put in place to help unemployed workers who couldn't find jobs and whose state unemployment insurance had run out. Back then, the jobless rate was 5.6%. It later climbed to more than 10% in 2009, and the government extended or expanded the federal benefits 11 times into the weak recovery, most recently in January 2013. Jobs end year on a downer. Currently, top lawmakers are in quiet negotiations to see if they can come up with a bipartisan deal to extend federal benefits.","2.3 million children have a long-term jobless parent - Jan. 14, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/14/news/economy/children-jobless/index.html

296,"Jones Lang Lasalle sports a cantilevered ceiling not normally seen in office spaces along with large open office work areas ""Benching"" instead of tight cubicles. The duct also works to give the feel of a loft space. Inset: Mitchell Konsker. Photo: Lorenzo Ciniglio/Freelance. Like a bear waking up from hibernation, todayís executives are coming out of their luxurious private offices and joining their workforce on open floor plates. Private corner offices are becoming a thing of the past as they are appropriated for shared amenity space. The open space plans, see-over cubicles and long benching areas are similar to the setup used by former Mayor Mike Bloomberg when he parked himself in the middle of the action at City Hall. By contrast, the decision by Mayor Bill de Blasio to use former Mayor Rudy Giulianiís massive office for himself is contrary to the new progressive management style being adopted by the cityís companies. ìRents in New York City continue to escalate and the companies can do more with less space,î said Marc Spector, an architect and principal of The Spector Group. ìItís an absolute trend of pulling them out of larger offices and work spaces into ergonomic benching.î As a side effect of all the elbow rubbing, architects are now designing more private telephone or conference room areas where workers can have a little privacy ó and in some cases, take politics out of the corner office by reconfiguring them as conference rooms. ìWhen you take them out of offices and into work stations you have to provide them other areas to have the quiet time and heads down time away from their desks,î said Spector who calls them ìTouch Downî spaces. ìWe use the term regularly now in describing to clients how to keep the employees happy.î To keep the back-stabbing to a minimum, corporations are also shying away from assigning corner offices and are instead using them as meeting rooms. ìIt is not politics but a buy in (to the idea) by senior executives that goes towards increasing efficiencies and driving down operating costs,î explained Mitchell Konsker, vice chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle who represents both building owners and tenants in deals for office spaces. ìFor every deal I am looking at, the companies are looking at their space studies and they are still compressing the size of their standards, and that affects the bottom line.î Jones Lang Lasalle is equipped with a large and open cafe area. Photo: Lorenzo Ciniglio/Freelance. As the size of the offices and bullpen areas compress, Konsker said the companies are providing about 30 percent more in amenities that include conference areas, meeting spaces, and large open cafes, with many of them, including the reception areas, doubling as entertainment spaces. ìWe are seeing a 25 percent to 30 percent drop in the size of the private offices,î agreed Spector. Associate-sized offices that were previously 12-by-15 are now 10-by-12 or 9.5-by-11, depending on the building, the core and how the offices lay out between the columns and windows. Konsker sees companies looking at workplace strategies that include benching versus open bullpen versus smaller 6-by-6 cubicles. ìInstead of having three sizes of offices itís down to one or two sizes of offices,î Konsker said. Whether in high-end Midtown offices or utilitarian tech spaces in Midtown South, the new designs have more open ceilings and a more industrial look. Konskerís own space in Jones Lang LaSalleís new open plan offices at 330 Madison also has an unusual cantilevered ceiling. He is representing 650 Madison Ave. where a new ownership group created prebuilt offices with open ceilings, which gave one of the highest end Midtown office environments an industrial look ó and recently obtained a lofty $150 per foot rent for the space. ìThe tenants are trying to recreate the polished floor slab and not have hung ceilings but are still giving their employees high-end amenities,î said Konsker, who declined to discuss the pricing on the 650 Madison lease. Investment sales broker Nat Rockett, an executive vice president in the Capital Market Group at Cushman & Wakefield, said the issue of ìdensificationî comes up with investors as they conduct due diligence on the purchase of office buildings. ìIf the employees donít like it and they have turnover, then the HR people will kill it,î Rockett predicted. ìWe talk about how a building will respond to the densification and if the pendulum swings back, is that going to be a problem (for the building owner) in renting the space?î Marc Spectorís architect brother and partner, Scott Spector, says he isnít worried about a blow-back from up-and-coming executives who may start feeling their oats and request a private office as a perk. ìI donít foresee it based on what we are programming for tenants right now that are signing five- and 10-year leases,î he said. To keep the executives happy while they are uprooted from their offices, some of the leadership is moving into what he called a ìLeadership Hubî zone. This area has five to ten work positions for senior managers and a dedicated conference room for when they need privacy. ìWe are seeing them come out of the offices to more collaborative environments,î he said. True, the top executive may take over two positions or desk areas rather than one, and there are cases where the CEO still has a private office. Lawyers and financial services companies that handle or have to discuss sensitive client or company information are also still stuck behind walls ó although they are more likely to be walls of glass. Scott said designing for a law firm is very different than for a next step media company. ìBut they are thinking about it because itís the next group coming up that is looking for this collaborative environment,î he said.",Next generation offices trade private lairs for common areas | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/next-generation-offices-trade-private-lairs-for-common-areas/

He also forced two-time campaign manager Bill Stepien to cancel plans to be named the next New Jersey state Republican chairman over his role in the fiasco.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Workers at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware rejected a proposal Wednesday evening that would have created the retailer's first union organization in the United States. Some workers at the facility, who repair and keep the equipment running at the Middletown warehouse, were hoping a union could help them establish more consistent policies when it comes to promotions, raises and vacations, said John Carr, spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which helped organize the workers. Twenty-one workers voted against the proposal, while six were in favor. A simple majority of voting employees was required. The vote did not include the packers and shippers who make up the bulk of Amazon employees at the facility. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company already provides competitive wages and comprehensive benefits. ""With today's vote against third-party representation, our employees have made it clear that they prefer a direct connection with Amazon,"" said Mary Osako, an Amazon spokeswoman. ""This direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the wants and needs of our employees."" Carr said the company had called the workers into meetings to tell them why they don't need a union. ""The workers at Amazon faced intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants hired to suppress this organizing drive,"" Carr said in a statement. ""We responded when these workers initially reached out to us, and we'll continue to work with them to pursue the collective bargaining rights they're entitled to under federal labor law.""

301,"Will a higher minimum wage really reduce income inequality? President Obama has backed an increase in the minimum wage, saying it will be good for the economy and good for families. He is expected to push for it again in his upcoming State of the Union address. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Raising the federal minimum wage could help bring many low-wage workers above the poverty line. It also could help restore the value of the minimum wage, which hasn't kept pace with inflation over the past 40 years. But can it really address income inequality? ""It will reduce inequality. The question is how much and for whom. It's not going to have a huge impact, but that's because there's no politically feasible policy that would have a big impact,"" said poverty and fiscal expert Isabel Sawhill , co-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution. Consider the 5-figure paycheck of a janitor versus the 8-figure salary of a CEO. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25, as a leading proposal in Congress would do, wouldn't narrow that chasm. There's also a big gap between those making 6-figures and the bazillionaires at the very top. A higher minimum wage can't touch that. Then there's the gap between very low-wage and middle-wage workers. It's this gap where advocates say some progress may be made if the minimum wage is raised sufficiently. At its peak in 1968, the minimum wage was equal to 54% of average hourly earnings in the private sector. Today, it comes in at 36%, according to the Congressional Research Service. ""There are a lot of causes of inequality but [the erosion of the minimum wage] is one of the important ones for inequality at the bottom,"" Jason Furman, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers , said this week. Obama, who backs the $10.10 proposal, has said raising the minimum wage would be good for the economy and good for families. A higher minimum wage could increase the pay not only for the 1.6 million workers who earn $7.25 today, but an estimated 17 million workers who make between $7.25 and $10.10. In selling the idea of a higher minimum, though, advocates also say it could result in raises for hourly workers across the board in what's known as the ""ripple"" effect. In other words, employers may want to preserve their relative pay scales, so may raise other hourly workers' pay by an amount commensurate with the minimum wage hike. That may help the economy and make workers happy. But it likely wouldn't do much to reduce the wage gap . What would narrow the gap is what's known as ""wage compression."" That is, employers may try to offset the cost of a minimum wage increase by freezing or reducing the pay of higher income employees. Wage wars: The fight for higher pay. In any case, hiking the minimum wage won't alter some of the root causes of income inequality. Sawhill thinks globalization and technology top the list, creating a bigger wage premium for those near the top and stagnating wages at the bottom. She also cites the U.S. education system, which she says has not kept pace with employer needs, evidenced by the fact that demand for educated workers outstrips the supply.","Will a higher minimum wage really reduce income inequality? - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/news/economy/income-inequality-minimum-wage/index.html
302,"Minimum wage hike could mean a raise for all. When New Jersey increased its minimum wage this year, Dolores Riley gave raises to all 16 employees at her childcare center. But it wasn't because they were all making $7.25 an hour. In fact, only five staff members at Gramma's School House were affected when New Jersey upped its minimum wage to $8.25. But Riley didn't want to increase the pay of the least experienced employees without also rewarding those who had been there the longest. So she increased everyone's pay by $.25 an hour. She says it will increase her labor costs by $10,000 to $15,000 annually, a fact she's not happy about, since she'll be taking a pay cut to cover it. Riley is not alone. When there's a minimum wage increase, some small business owners will raise the pay for most, if not all, hourly workers in order to preserve their wage structure and retain quality employees. That's what economists call a ripple effect, meaning an increase in the minimum wage spills over to higher wage brackets. On Jan. 1, 13 states raised their minimum wage (by varying degrees), and on July 1, California will increase its by $1 an hour. As a result, the Economic Policy Institute estimates about 4.6 million workers will see their wages increased, 2.6 million of whom are directly affected as the new minimum wage exceeds their current hourly pay. The other 2 million already make slightly more than the new minimum wage but will benefit from the ripple effect. And it could well be the entire country that sees an increase soon. Congressional Democrats and President Obama are pushing to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2015. For Joann Marks, who owns Florida-based marketing company Cosmetic Promotions, that would require raises for all six of her hourly workers, even though they are paid at least $10 an hour, well above Florida's current minimum wage of $7.93. She would also increase the pay of two of her salaried employees. Broken down, their compensation is equal to about $11 an hour, and Marks wants to pay them more than just above the minimum rate. When wages increase, business owners are left with two options: cut back on staff or raise prices. But sometimes, one or both of those can't be easily altered. About 75% of Cosmetic Promotions' business comes from partnerships with chain stores where prices are already set by a contract. So Marks expects to cut one worker from her staff of 15 if the new federal wage is approved. ""We work better with all these people, but we'd survive if we had to lose one,"" Marks said. Meanwhile, Riley's hands are tied when it comes to the number of employees at Gramma's School House. The state mandates how many caregivers she must have in the room based on the number of children. And raising prices is not appealing. As the economy weakened, parents lost jobs and no longer needed her services. Riley says she's making only a quarter of what she made before 2008 and enrollment is still declining.","A minimum wage raise means a raise for everyone - Jan. 14, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/14/smallbusiness/minimum-wage-hike/index.html
303,"Energy boom's impact on national security. A new report says the U.S. energy boom could destabilize some allies, and spark aggression from Russia and China, among other national security threats. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) The U.S. energy boom could have far reaching effects on the world stage, according to a new report. Acknowledging that the boom is creating jobs and decreasing the need for oil imports, the boom could also lead to increasing instability in some U.S. allies, cause some African nations and Russia to strengthen ties with China, and provoke the Chinese and Russians to become more aggressive. The report , released Wednesday, comes from several leading national security figures, including a former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former director of national intelligence and a former Marine Corps commandant. Despite most Middle Eastern oil going to Asia and projections that show North America may be able to produce all the oil it consumes by 2020, the report said the U.S. should still not withdraw from its role as global policeman. ""It is often suggested that the United States could disengage militarily from volatile oil-producing regions, clearing the way for a larger security role and increased burden-sharing by energy-hungry emerging economies,"" the report said. Yet oil is a globally traded commodity, so a disruption anywhere will impact the price in the United States, adding that the call to disengage ""ignores the potential for wide ranging uncertainty in current forecasts."" The boom could be disruptive for countries that sell oil to the United States. Already, the African nations of Nigeria and Angola are looking to sell oil to China as demand for their crude declines in the United States. There are new transaction costs associated with that, and the countries have lost revenue in the process. In the Middle East, surging oil consumption at home that's eating into oil exports and a growing population has made the region increasingly reliant on high oil prices . If those prices fall -- perhaps partly because of the U.S. oil boom -- those governments could come under severe pressure. How U.S. oil affects national security. The same is true for Russia, where a reliance on high oil prices could cause the country to ""pursue more assertive and more destabilizing foreign policy actions,"" the report said. China could also become more assertive as its oil imports surge and the nation moves to protect new energy deals with countries in the Middle East or Africa. To reduce the potential for conflict, the report says the United States should take several steps, including: -- Strengthen partnerships with other nations to protect shipping routes.","The energy boom's impact on national Security - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/news/economy/oil-boom-national-security/index.html
304,"By the time he visits the White House next month, French President FranÁois Hollande insists he will have figured which of two women he will continue sleeping with ó and call his first lady. The embarrassed and embattled president vowed on Tuesday to make some sense of the national soap opera that has dominated his country for days: Is his live-in girlfriend of many years, Valerie Trierweiler, still the first lady of France? Or has he officially ditched her for his new ó and, until last Friday ó secret love, Julie Gayet, a gorgeous blond actress 18 years his junior, and seven years younger than Trierweiler? The triangle took on added dimension Tuesday when a source close to Hollande claimed that Gayet is four months pregnant. Trierweiler had been invited to accompany Hollande for a state dinner hosted by President Obama ó including an overnight stay at the White House Feb. 11. But Trierweiler, 48, has been hospitalized ó with what is described as a serious case of ìthe bluesî ó since a French magazine revealed that Hollande, 59, had been sneaking out of his presidential place amid a yearlong affair with Gayet, 41. ìEveryone in their personal lives can go through tough times. That is the case [for me]. These are painful moments. ìBut I have one principle: these private affairs are dealt with in private. This is neither the time nor the place to do it, so I will not be responding to any questions about my private life.î However, he said that by the time he sits down at the state dinner with the Obamas, he will have come up with an answer to the question. Or, as he put it: ìIf I do not go into detail about this today, then I will do so before the meeting which you refer to.î Then he added that France doesnít really have a first lady because there is ìno official statusî conferred on a presidentís wife or partner. And, in words that couldnít have made Trierweiler happy, he said the government money spent on a first lady should be made public ó and ìas small as possible.î Trierweiler, a former journalist, has made it clear that she is eager to make the Washington trip and wants to know whether she is still Hollandeís lover, officially or unofficially. She had lived with Hollande for years and moved into the ElysÈe Palace, where she has her own office and staff, after he was elected in 2012. The White House said on Tuesday that Hollandeís trip is still on ó but said questions about who would be accompanying him should be asked in Paris. In a press conference that lasted more than 2π/2 hours, Hollande was only asked four questions about Trierweiler by a mass of reporters who seemed terrified of raising ìlíaffaire Gayet.î Asked about Trierweilerís health, Hollande said, ìSheís resting and I have no further comment to make.î For the rest of the press conference, Hollande droned on about French taxes, renewable energy, relations with Germany and other less-than-hot topics. As for Gayet, she hasnít spoken or surfaced since the scandal broke. But a post on the official Twitter account of the lereel.fr Web site said, ìJulie Gayet is four months pregnant according to a source close to Francois Hollande at the ElysÈe.î It added that this had been confirmed by a journalist at Franceís M6 television news channel. Hollande was already the least popular French president in modern history even before the magazine Closer caught him sneaking off from the palace to see Gayet. It published embarrassing photos including one of Hollande apparently disguised in a motorcycle helmet to avoid being recognized. He told reporters Tuesday his ìindignation is totalî over the exposÈ and left open the possibility that he would sue Closer. But he didnít deny anything the magazine said. This was not supposed to happen to Hollande, who was elected two years ago by a French public tired of reading the latest disclosures about his flamboyant predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. Hollande, who has four children from a previous relationship with a leading politician, ran as ìMonsieur Normal,î the candidate who would never be associated with scandal. Dominique Moisi, a French political analyst, said Hollande has only himself to blame. ìHe wanted to impress the French with the fact that he was a normal man, that he was a man of dignity, simplicity, moral rigor,î he said. ìSuddenly the French are discovering that he is like others, but in a less glorious manner, even a ridiculous manner.î",French prez Hollande will pick lover in time for Obama visit | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/hollande-admits-personal-ordeal-as-affair-scandal-grows/
305,"State with highest minimum wage may hike it again. The governor of Washington is calling for an increase in the state's minimum wage, which is already the highest in the nation. Washington currently requires employers to pay $9.32 an hour, well above the national minimum of $7.25. In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Jay Inslee didn't propose a precise increase, saying he wanted to discuss it with lawmakers. But he said it should be in the range of $1.50 to $2.50 an hour -- or a 16% to 27% increase. ""It won't be a number that remedies 50 years of income inequality,"" he said. ""There is ample evidence that a raise in that range does not kill jobs. An increase in minimum wage means more money being spent in our economy."" The minimum wage increased in 13 states and four cities on Jan. 1. Among those was Washington state, where the minimum went up slightly as part of a cost-of-living trigger. Some in Congress are pushing to raise the national minimum wage. A plan endorsed by key Democrats and President Obama would increase it to $10.10 within three years of passage. On Tuesday, a group of 75 leading economists , including seven with Nobel Prizes, endorsed raising the minimum wage in a letter sent to Congress. But there is still strong opposition to a higher minimum wage from many business groups as well as Republicans. Inslee, a Democrat, faces likely opposition in the legislature, where Republicans control the state senate. Wage wars: The fight for higher pay. ""I recognize the political realities of the split control,"" he said. ""But we must spend time and energy -- and yes, political capital -- helping make sure everyone in Washington is paid a fair wage."" In November voters in the small Washington city of SeaTac , which includes the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and the surrounding businesses, voted to raise the minimum wage there to $15 an hour. But a state judge ruled in December that the increase doesn't apply to most workers at the airport.","Washington governor calls for raising nation's highest minimum wage - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/news/economy/washington-minimum-wage/index.html

307,"Seleka soldiers drive on a street during fighting in Bangui. Photo: Reuters. BANGUI, Central African Republic ó Fighting swept through the capital of Central African Republic on Thursday, leaving nearly one hundred people dead and posing the biggest threat yet to the countryís new government. The U.N. Security Council authorized an intervention force to prevent a bloodbath between Christians and Muslims. Witnesses and aid workers say at least 98 people are dead in Bangui after a day of clashes between the Muslim armed fighters who rule the country and a Christian militia who opposes them. An Associated Press journalist counted 48 bodies at a mosque in a northern neighborhood late Thursday. Separately, Doctors Without Borders confirmed at least 50 people were dead at hospitals they are running. The armed Christian fighters attacked the capital before dawn, in the most serious violence to hit Bangui since a March coup brought the Seleka rebel coalition to power. The former rebels are accused of committing scores of human rights abuses. The Christian militias who support the deposed president are implicated in massacres on Muslim communities. In Bangui, people scurried indoors, some seeking sanctuary in a church. Inside a Bangui hospital, dozens of people with gunshot wounds lay on the floor or on wooden benches, waiting for hours to see a physician. Underscoring the chaos, even the presidentís and prime ministerís homes were looted. The U.N. Security Council unanimously authorized increased military action by France and African troops aimed at restoring security and protecting civilians in the volatile former French colony. Speaking from the Elysee Palace in Paris, French President Francois Hollande promised that the 600 hundred troops in the country will be doubled ìwithin a few days, even a few hours.î He said the Central African Republic was ìcalling us for help,î and he ìdecided to act immediately.î The countryís prime minister welcomed the intervention while in Paris for a summit of dozens of African leaders hosted by Hollande. In his first reaction to the move, Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye told The Associated Press that he sees it ìvery positivelyî and that he had wanted a ìfirm reaction from France.î He called for fast action ìto put an end to this violence and these atrocities.î Tiangaye confirmed his house had been looted, describing the attackers as a group of Seleka who arrived in three pickup trucks. ìItís true, my house was attacked and pillaged,î he said, adding that his family was evacuated beforehand and were safe. Hours after fighting broke out, Central African Republicís president, who was installed by Seleka earlier this year, said the clashes were over. By afternoon, the streets were empty of all but military vehicles and the four-wheel-drive trucks favored by Seleka. Babacar Gaye, the U.N. special representative for the Central African Republic, appealed for calm in a joint statement from the U.N., European Union, African Union and France. Seleka is an unlikely group of allies who united a year ago with the goal of forcing President Francois Bozize from the presidency after a decade in power. After thousands of rebels besieged Bangui in March, Bozize fled and the insurgents installed their leader Michel Djotodia as president. Djotodia has increasingly sought to distance himself from Seleka, which has been blamed for scores of atrocities in Bangui, killing and raping civilians and stealing from aid groups and orphanages. He has even less control in the distant provinces where anger over Seleka human rights abuses fueled the formation of the Christian anti-balaka movement several months ago. Balaka means ìmachete.î While the anti-balaka fighters include villagers defending their communities against Seleka attacks, the group is believed to be receiving support from Bozize allies. The anti-balaka fighters also have been implicated in massacres on Muslim civilian populations, which also have suffered under the Seleka regime and say they are being unfairly blamed for the destruction. The U.N. Security Council resolution authorizes the deployment of an African Union-led force to Central African Republic for a year to protect civilians and restore security and public order. The AU force is replacing a regional peacekeeping mission whose presence has been mainly limited to the capital and a few northern cities. The U.N. resolution also authorizes French forces, for a temporary period, ìto take all necessary measuresî to support the AU-led force known as MISCA, whose troop numbers are expected to rise from about 2,500 to 3,500.",Nearly 100 dead in Central African Republic after clashes | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/12/05/nearly-100-dead-in-central-african-republic-after-clashes/

Trierweiler, Hollandeís live-in girlfriend for years, was hospitalized Friday when a French magazine disclosed he had been meeting Julie Gayet, 41, in a love nest. He sneaked out to see her while wearing a black motorcycle helmet as a disguise, the seven-page exposÈ revealed. Hollande is under strong pressure from his Socialist Party and the public to break up with Trierweiler, with whom he became secretly involved while living with his previous girlfriend, the mother of his four children. Trierweiler is a journalist who has all the taxpayer-financed perks of a first lady, including an entourage and an office in the ìmadame wingî of the presidential palace. Now she could lose all that. ìShe knows that if she is no longer first lady, she cannot continue to have an office in the ElysÈe and make use of state funds,î said a Le Parisien reporter who spoke with her Monday. Trierweiler was described as devastated by the prospect that she wonít be able to accompany Hollande to Washington for a state dinner hosted by President Obama on Feb. 11. ìValerie took it like being hit by a high speed train,î a friend said, according to the Daily Mail. ìShe was completely stunned. Of course, sheíd been aware of rumors circulating around Paris for weeks.î She was supposed to leave the hospital on Monday, but a top aide said she needs to stay there another six to eight days to recover from the ìextremely strong emotional shock.î Hollande could face the questions of 500 journalists on Tuesday when he is scheduled to outline his 2014 policy goals. The French, being French, have strong and conflicting views. One poll found 77 percent of the public said the affair is strictly Hollandeís private matter. Another poll found 89 percent wants him to announce his separation from Trierweiler. Others just want him to clear up the bedroom-farce narrative that has made him a national laughingstock. ìHe has to clarify the situation,î said Thierry Madon, spokesman of the Socialistsí parliamentary group. ìHe has to do it once, firmly and decisively, and then we donít talk about it anymore.î Still, ìlíaffaire Gayetî has boosted Hollandeís popularity.

A spokeswoman for Special Commissioner of Investigation Richard Condon confirmed a probe of the school, which follows a series of Post exposes about problems at Far Rockawayís PS 106 . Two of Condonís investigators were spotted entering the run-down kindergarten through fifth-grade school after its principal, Marcella Sills , was serenaded with boos by angry parents frustrated over a lack of resources and leadership.

The fur-clad Sills first backed her BMW X3 into her reserved parking space at 7:13 a.m. But after sitting in the $40,000 luxury SUV for about a minute, she suddenly gunned the engine and sped out of the lot. Sills stopped in the middle of Beach 35th Street near the schoolís main entrance and sat there for several minutes. The embattled principal then drove back to the parking lot but apparently changed her mind, pulled out again and headed south toward the boardwalk and beach before disappearing from view until her return nearly an hour later. This came a day after Sills dragged herself into class on time Monday ó sauntering through the doors at 7:30 a.m. in a bid to look good for investigators probing her failing and dilapidated school. ìShe hasnít shown up that early in six or seven years,î a source said. Sills appeared to be scrambling like a failing student at finals time to put on a show for the city Department of Education probers who showed up following a series of Post exposÈs. PS 106 earned its ìSchool of Noî moniker because, numerous school sources say, it has no gym, no art classes, kindergarten trailers that smell like animal urine and no reading, writing or math books for the rigorous Common Core curriculum. Students are frequently plopped in front of movie screens for hours on end instead of learning. Despite the squalor, Sills still forces parents ó many of whom live below the poverty line ó to cough up more than $200 to attend a bizarre, end-of-year prom in which fifth-graders must dress up like brides and grooms. Also, sources say Sills frequently fails to attend work. But on Monday, outraged insiders said she got to school early and staged a rare art class for visitors ó and even managed to buy books at the last minute. Itís not clear how well the principalís last-minute whitewashing worked ó but hours after the inspection the DOEís new head issued a statement saying her office would be keeping a close eye on the school. ìThere is significant room for organizational improvement,î Schools Chancellor Carmen FariÒa said. ìBut [Deputy Chancellor Dorita Gibson reported] that classrooms are orderly, teachers are dedicated, and students are learning.

The kids, many of whom live below the poverty line, must foot the bill for the strange get-ups, which Sills personally picks out at stores such as Menís Wearhouse and Davidís Bridal, parents and ex-teachers said.

There were about 25 people in the theater at the time of the shooting. ìI canít believe people would bring a pistol, a gun, to a movie,î said Charles Cummings, who was sitting near Oulson and Reeves. ìI canít believe they would argue and fight and shoot one another over popcorn. Over a cellphone.î Cummings, who said he had been a combat Marine in Vietnam, said the victim fell onto him and his son. When dad and son spoke to reporters Monday, both had blood on their clothes. ìBlood started coming out of his mouth,î said the son, Alex. ìIt was just a very bad scene.î Charles said he and another patron, who happened to be a nurse, began performing CPR on Oulson, while Alex went to call 911. A man sitting next to the suspect was an off-duty deputy from another county, and he grabbed the gun out of Reevesí hand. Reeves did not attempt to get away, Charles said. When cops arrived to arrest Reeves, ìhe was very calm. He was seated in the chair, looking at the screen,î Sgt. Steve Greiner said. Reevesí lawyer, Richard Escobar, later said his clientís reaction was natural. ìThe alleged victim attacked him,î Escobar said. ìAt that point in time, he has every right to defend himself.î",Inside movie murder: Texting and popcorn made ex-cop ësnapí | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/shooting-victim-was-texting-daughters-daycare/
312,"Target hack is mostly harmless for consumers. Target will take the biggest hit from the hack. But customers need to stay on guard. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) The Target hack sure sounds scary: Tens of millions of shoppers' credit card data were stolen and are being sold on the black market. Hackers took emails, phone numbers and PINs too. But there's comforting news in all this for consumers: Though the breach will be irritating for millions of shoppers who have to get new credit and debit cards, Target customers shouldn't lose a dime. The reality is, Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) will take the biggest hit. When fraudulent purchases are made with a credit card, the credit card companies make the customer and the bank whole. They then recover the money that was fraudulently charged by fining the merchant or raising the merchant's swipe fees. That means consumers shouldn't worry about reports that hackers are selling the stolen credit and debit card information on the black market. Brian Krebs , the cybersecurity journalist who uncovered the Target breach, has traced the stolen data to card shops online. But if the card numbers haven't already been canceled, Target will be responsible for paying for whatever goods were purchased with the cards after they were stolen. What's left for customers who shopped at Target's U.S. stores between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 is the headache of staying on guard, monitoring their bank statements and getting a new card. Target even started offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection as an added safety measure. That's because hackers didn't just break into Target's point-of-sale system and collect data from magnetic stripes on 40 million payment cards . They also wormed their way into Target's massive database of 70 million customers , which included names, emails, phone numbers and addresses. On the one hand, criminals with that information have a better chance of duping you. They already know you shop at Target. Expect phone calls, phishing emails and letters with criminals posing as Target, the bank or law enforcement asking for even more sensitive information, such as your Social Security number or PIN. On the other hand, criminals can't steal your identity by just knowing your contact information. The real damage here is that hackers know one thing: You shop at Target. ""It's bad they got a customer list, but the worst case scenario is a very targeted email phishing campaign,"" said Adrian Sanabria, a senior security analyst at 451 Research in Knoxville, Tenn. ""I don't see any risk of identity theft from having that exposed."" The average consumer won't feel much of an impact -- if any -- from the Target breach. But practicing safe Web browsing behavior , changing passwords frequently and monitoring credit card statements would be smart steps to take.","Target hack is mostly harmless for consumers - Jan. 13, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/13/technology/security/target-hack/index.html
313,"They are young, female, and in love ñ and they are the doomed followers of a man known as Russiaís Osama bin Laden. They are the ìblack widowsî of Russiaís extremist terrorist group and are selected for death almost from the moment they join up. Lured by the promise of a key role in a coming Russian holy war led by a charismatic madman with bin Laden-style aims, the women ñ some still in their teens ñ enjoy a brief, passionate relationships with Russian men who are also terror recruits. Then, after he blows himself up in a suicide bombing, the new widow prepares herself for her own fiery end. Willing to become martyrs for their beliefs and their lost loved ones, they enter train stations, buses and airports strapped with explosives destined to cause death and havoc. The cult of the black widow is striking fear in the hearts of Russian parents who are losing daughters and sons to the terror group which is bent on a suicide bombing jihad. Following two lethal bomb blasts in the southern Russian city of Volgograd this week, fears the terrorist cult will threaten the safety of Australians and other athletes competing in the Winter Olympics next month have escalated. The leader of the group is Doku Umarov, a 49-year-old former oil construction engineer turned Islamic war lord and now dubbed the countryís Osama bin Laden. The US government has placed a $5 million bounty on the head of the Chechen-born self-proclaimed emir of a new Muslim state he calls the Caucasus Emirate. Umarov has made a direct threat against the February 7-23 Sochi Games, saying it was his holy duty to prevent them from taking place. Authorities believe Umarov is operating his terrorist movement out of the strife-torn southern republic of Dagestan, which lies between the Caucasus mountains and the Caspian Sea. Umarov has denounced the establishment of Sochiís Olympic village as a defilement of the ìsacred groundî once occupied by Circassians, who were ìethnically cleansedî by Russia in the 19th century. Although young terrorist recruits to Umarovís movement have come from all over Russia, at least one black widow, Naida Asiyalova, who blew herself up in a suicide bombing in Volgograd in October, is from Dagestan. The deadly Russian 'black widow' cult.

The covered bodies of victims lie on the ground as Russian security personnel inspect the scene of a suicide attack at a train station in Volgograd. Getty Images/Stringer. Investigators work near the body of a victim after an explosion outside of a train station in Volgograd. Known as Amaturahman, Asiyalova was in love with another suicide bomber before she ìdid her dutyî to the jihad cause. She was a close friend of the missing woman initially implicated in this weekís Volgograd station bombing. As the death toll rises from the Volgograd bombings, Russian investigators have linked the explosions. Russian Investigative Committee spokesman, Vladimir Markin confirmed Sundayís Volgograd train station was the work of a suicide bomber, whose ìsignature closely matchesî the following dayís bomb on a trolley. Police first identified 26-year-old black widow Oksana Aslanova. Russian news source Life News published a picture of what it reported was her bloodied head lying amid a pile of debris with her long brown hair spread across the train station floor. Aslanova, who has been on Russiaís wanted list for two years, has reportedly been married to two Islamic militant leaders liquidated by Russian forces in the North Caucasus. After investigators found further remains ñ a male finger with a pin from a grenade ñ among the debris at the crime scene, a new culprit emerged. Pavel Pechyonkin, a medical school graduate, left Moscow to join Dagestani militants in 2011. It is believed he became a disciple of Doku Umarov. Oksana Aslanova is now thought to be still at large. As Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a further security crackdown, Sochi, which lies west of Dagestan on the Black sea coast, is being turned into a massive security fortress. Umarov is said to excel in hostage-taking and suicide bombing, favoring buses, trains, rail stations and airports where he can kill and maim as many people as possible and cause maximum transport mayhem. These are the bombings he is credited with and the black widows or young male recruits it is said have danced to his tune: Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova was only 16 when she met and married Umalat Magomedov, a Dagestani Islamist rebel killed in 2009. A classic, if very young example of the ìblack widowî cult which is a feature of the Russian Islamic terror campaign, Abdurakhmanova was part of a nationwide recruiting campaign by the Chechen rebel group. Once lured in, the women are immediately treated as potential suicide bombers. They are not told this, rather they are treated the same way as male recruits and included in discussions about the right and wrong ways of Islamic faith. Then the girl becomes a wife or mistress of the young war lord. Abdurakhmanovaís husband, Magomedov, aka Emir Al Bara, was the leader of the Shariat Jamaat organisation in Dagestan and an appointee of Doku Umarov. After the husbandís inevitable death ñ Magomedov was killed by Russian security forces on 31 December 2009 ñ the new widow may become the wife of another member of the armed underground. From thereon, the black widow begins a new stage: preparing for suicide bombing. Abdurakhmanova, whose real name was Janet Abdullaev, was one of two women earmarked by Umarov to carry out bombings during the morning rush hour at Moscowís Metro station on March 29, 2010. At the time, an estimated 500,000 people were commuting through the Moscow subway system. At least 40 people died and more than 90 were injured. Russian officials called the incident ìthe deadliest and most sophisticated terrorist attack in the Russian capital in six yearsî. About 48 hours later, a double suicide bombing in the Dagestani town of Kizylar killed 12 people including nine policemen. Suicide bomber in the name of love: Maryam Sharipova Magomedov. Photo: News.com.au. Married to close Umarov associate, Magomedali Vagabov, killed in an operation in Dagestan along with four other militants in August 2010, Sharipova was identified after police released photographs of her remains in the bombing aftermath. Sharipovaís father recognised his daughter in photographs of her remains. He told authorities Sharipova, who taught computer science at a local school, had gone missing the day before the attacks. She had allegedly told her mother that she was going to visit a friend. The couple had not heard from her since. Sharipova, who lived with her parents in the village of Balakhani in Dagestan, was never known to show extremist views or unusual behavior, her father said. Naida Asiyalova, whose jihadi name was ìAmaturahmanî, was a 30-year-old Dagestani national and alleged wife of Dmitry Sokolov, a militant in the regional capital of Makhachkala. Neighbours from her village remembered an ordinary, westernised girl who was not religious, but who married a Turk, and ìthen something happenedî and she ìchanged completelyî and began attending the mosque and wearing a scarf. Asiyalova and Sokolov met in the Moscow suburbs, where she recruited him to radical Islam. Dmitry Sokolov (left) and his future wife Naida Asiyalova, both pictured before they converted to Islamic extremism. Photo: News.com.au. They later left the capital to join rebel groups in Dagestan. Sokolov was reported missing in July 2012 after he failed to return home from Arabic language courses that he attended at one of the capitalís mosques. Taking on the rebel name of Abdul Jabbar, he allegedly took part in the two 2010 Dagestan explosions. Russian media reported Asiyalova had a serious disease which caused her jawbone to recede and required tranquilizers and painkillers. Asiyalova constantly changed her place of residence from Makhachkala to other Dagestani cities, where she met with the widows and wives of militants. An ardent convert, she was popular and had access to money collected at Muslim gatherings aimed at preaching Islam. On the morning of October 21 last year, she boarded a bus in Volgograd with explosives strapped to her body beneath her flowing veil. At about 2.05 pm Moscow time, she detonated the bombs, killing six people and injuring 37 others, included a 20-month-old child. A fundraiser was previously organised on social network VKontakte for her treatment. It stated that she had a disease which caused her jawbone to recede. Now one of the most wanted women in Russia, Oksana Aslanova is reportedly the black widow of two extremist warlords. Born in 1987, she later moved to Dagestan, where she married Mansur Velibekov, a Chechen radical and member of a criminal ring wiped out in 2008. Upon his death, Aslanova became a so-called ìSharia wifeî of the gangís leader, Gasan Abdulayev. Another report suggests that Aslanova was also married to a known terrorist, Israpil Validzhanov, who went under the nickname of Amir Hasan. He was eliminated on March 18, 2011 near the Dagestani village of Tashkapur. She has been missing since March 8, 2012 and it is now believed the ìblack widowî who outlived three husbands has undergone training as a suicide bomber.",The deadly Russian ëblack widowí cult | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/02/russias-deadly-black-widow-cult-that-threatens-olympians/
314,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa ó Oscar Pistorius was served with new indictment papers Wednesday containing two extra charges believed to allege that he recklessly shot his gun out the open sunroof of a car last year and fired someone elseís handgun at a restaurant weeks before he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The double-amputee Olympian has already been indicted on a main charge of murder for the Feb. 14 shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp and another firearm charge for illegal possession of ammunition in his home. He now faces the two additional charges relating to firing guns in public. Pistorius will likely face all four charges at his trial starting in March, although his lawyers can argue against the new gun charges being added to his current indictment as the offenses are alleged to have taken place in Johannesburg ó a different court jurisdiction to Pistoriusí fatal shooting of Steenkamp at his upscale villa in the South African capital, Pretoria, in the pre-dawn hours of Valentineís Day. Pistoriusí lawyers were served with the new papers, South Africaís national prosecution spokesman Nathi Mncube told The Associated Press. ìWhat happened today is Ö Mr. Pistorius was served with a new indictment.î Mncube said. ìWe have to advise him (of the extra charges) to accord him with enough time to prepare his defense.î Mncube declined to give the exact details of the new charges, only saying they ìrelate to the contravention of the firearms act.î Mncube also said there had been no indication from Pistoriusí lawyers if they would challenge the adding of the charges to Pistoriusí indictment for the trial. Prosecutors sought special permission to include the two gun charges against Pistorius on the indictment because they did not fall in the same jurisdiction. Permission was granted by South Africaís director of public prosecutions last month. Itís reported in South Africa that the new charges relate to two alleged incidents where Pistorius recklessly shot a gun in public: The first when Pistorius is alleged to have fired his own licensed 9mm handgun ó the gun used to kill Steenkamp ó out the open sunroof of a car in Johannesburg while traveling with friends last year. In the second in January this year, and just weeks before Steenkampís shooting death, Pistorius is said to have accidentally shot a friendís gun under the table at a Johannesburg restaurant, apparently while admiring it. For both alleged offenses he could be charged with public endangerment and damage to property. The multiple Paralympic champion, known as the ëBlade Runner,í is world-famous for his carbon fiber running blades and for becoming the first amputee to compete on the track at the Olympics. He already faces a possible life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison if he is convicted of premeditated murder for fatally shooting Steenkamp. Pistorius says he shot her by mistake thinking she was a dangerous intruder in his house. It will be Pistoriusí 27th birthday on Friday and he was photographed by a newspaper this weekend while out at a Johannesburg restaurant with family, according to the paper. The City Press published photos Sunday of Pistorius in the restaurant wearing a white T-shirt and with a short beard, smiling in one photo and with a black baseball cap pulled down near his eyes in another. The newspaper also quoted Pistorius as saying that he was ìanxiousî about his upcoming trial. ìI feel calm. I now spend most of my time with my family and I enjoy their company,î Pistorius said, according to the newspaper, in rare public comments. ìThey are wonderful and their support is incredible. But, I must say, at the same time I am also anxious about the upcoming court case.î",Pistorius cops 2 more gun charges | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/11/21/pistorius-served-papers-with-2-more-gun-charges/
315,"If you have been experiencing stress, anger and frustration at the workplace, it could stem from a difficult coworker. His actions and behaviour are either hindering the achievement of team goals or hampering your personal success and peace of mind. As a first step to dealing with such people, you need to understand why they are troublesome. Are they not delivering on expected output, or are they negatively affecting the morale? The output could be below expectations because either they are unwilling to work or do not have the required skills. If they trigger negative emotions, either the behaviour doesn't fit in with the work culture or he simply chooses to go against every team decision. Once you identify the key issue, here are the three ways you can resolve it. 1. MOTIVATE. If you believe the person can change his behaviour, try motivation. This is the ideal approach since it transforms a challenging co-worker into a contributer. This works best when the person is a peer or you have more power. Avoid it with your boss or a person with greater power. First, state precisely the change in behaviour you seek. Then figure out the positive and negative drivers of his behaviour. The positive ones may include achievement, knowledge, security or fun, whereas the negative ones can include criticism, isolation, lack of feedback or encouragement. Understand that the person who loves to disagree with the team on every subject may not respond to peer pressure or criticism, but may be sensitive to communication that appeals to his self-esteem. Choose a favourable time and place to discuss the matter with him. If you are equals, involve other team members and structure it into a team discussion. Follow a few basic principles during the discussion. Use neutral language and a fixed format of action, outcome and emotion. For instance, you can say, ""When you did not deliver within the deadline, the customer cancelled the order and the team felt frustrated that its efforts had gone down the drain."" Don't lecture from a higher moral ground. Request change in action or communication, not in personality. Stay calm and focused on the issue and avoid personal attacks even if he gets defensive or agitated. Speak in the language of what both parties want and offer a quid pro quo from the team, saying, ""We expect you to meet deadlines and you will have an equal chance to lead sales meetings."" Reach a consensus on solving the issue and measuring successful actions. The team must be a part of the solution. Encourage him to make a voluntary, public commitment and establish the ground rules for measuring failure and consequent, punitive steps. 2. REJECT. The common reaction is to reject and remove a difficult person from the environment. Choose this option only if you believe it's not possible to change the co-worker's actions. For instance, if the colleague lacks knowledge, but is able and keen, it is efficient to invest in training rather than a risky replacement. The easiest way to reject is to rearrange individual responsibilities such that the negative impact becomes irrelevant. So, you can shift a short-tempered colleague from a role that requires client interaction and make sure the careless one is not responsible for critical data. The biggest drawback of this approach is that it could lead to an undesirable deterioration of the situation, culminating in a complete breakdown. One of the most common forms of rejection is micro-managing a difficult colleague's output or ganging up against him as a team. In both cases, you are communicating that you lack confidence and are isolating him. The co-worker either loses all motivation to contribute or digs in his heels. To avoid such outcomes, examine and change your words, behaviour and actions that are escalating the situation. Be truthful, but kind, in your communication and avoid revenge or emotional drama while dealing with him.",3 ways to deal with difficult co-workers - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/jobs/3-ways-to-deal-with-difficult-co-workers/articleshow/28675474.cms

317,"NEW DELHI: BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Wednesday listed out key areas of focus such as education, industry, agriculture and services that the country needs to develop in order to ensure progress. Addressing India Inc at a FICCI event, Modi showcased his vision for India and emphasised the need to think out-of-the box for progressive and inclusive growth. Growth of Industry: Emphasising the importance of 'restoring faith and trust', Modi said that industrial sector needs to come out of 'this gloomy environment'. ""There is no dearth of opportunity for the industry in India,"" Modi said. ""If we want employment, we need development of industry,"" he said. Education & skilled manpower: ""PM is very fond of inclusive growth but if we do not do capacity building among poor through education how can we make them skilled,"" he asked. Lamenting that India has become a country of 'gross underachievers', Modi said, ""ultimately one needs to empower the poor people in the country."" We need to work towards their skill development,"" he said. ""Skilled manpower is key to the development of our nation in the coming years. We need to change courses keeping in mind the changing trends in technology,"" he opined. Small-scale industries & health sector: Modi said, ""We have to make the common man a stakeholder in development. We need to build more small-scale industries. The small things need to be looked at to bring overall development."" Referring to the health sector, he said, ""Common man looks for cheap treatment. Indian hospitals are renowned in the world but the insurance process in India holds us back."" ""If people know that we have the power to provide insurance, foreigners will come here to get treatment,"" he said. Value addition: ""Value addition becomes important for natural resources. Socialist slogans are good but is that helping anyone?"" he asked. ""Trust, faith changes the situation in a nation. It builds a positive environment. We need to build trust across the country,"" he reiterated. Modi went on to say that in addition to increasing productivity in the nation, we need to look at value addition. ""There is a need for an integrated approach to development. Unless that comes, we will not progress,"" Modi said. ""The amount of land is not increasing but actually decreasing with population increase. Value addition is the best combination in service and agriculture sector,"" he said. Purchasing Power: According to Modi, in terms of purchasing power, agriculture and services sector are very important. ""Agriculture & service sectors are the pillars of our economy . Our focus should be to increase productivity in the nation,"" he said. ""Mahatma Gandhi said that one should think of how the last person in the line would gain. On those lines we need to think on purchasing power of poorest,"" he added. According to Modi, leadership is of importance. ""Leadership matters a lot. Is there determination & will to take decision? The need of the hour is that we inspire people to find answers to these,"" he said. Modi went on to say, ""We could have reached great heights if the governments at centre had planned well.""

Weir, who is openly gay, offhandedly characterized the laws as ìno anal sex in front of libraries,î according to Gay City News, which reported on Weirís Monday talk at Barnard College on the role of Olympic athletes. ìIíve never had a bad experience in Russia, not gotten called a fag or beat up,î said Weir, whose husband is of Russian descent. ìI only see the rosy, golden side [of Russia].

322,"NEW DELHI: Slamming Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for not practising what it preaches, party MLA Vinod Kumar Binny on Thursday said that the party deviated from its principles by forming a government that took support of Congress. ""This is against the party's principles,"" Binny said. Accusing Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of acting at the behest of the Congress, Binny said, ""Sandeep Dikshit and Arvind Kejriwal are close friends. The decisions are being influenced by Congress."" ""Many leaders could voice their dissent in coming days,"" Binny added. ""Why is Kejriwal not acting on corrupt leaders of the previous Congress regime?"" he asked. Binny also alleged that Manish Sisodia, Kumar Vishwas, Sanjay Singh & Arvind Kejriwal form the core group of AAP. ""They take all decisions behind closed doors,"" he said. ""Aam Aadmi Party is always hungry for publicity. AAP's manifesto is a play of words with the people,"" he said. ""You (Kejriwal) have become a dictator. Stop fooling the people of Delhi. All decisions in the party are taken in closed rooms by four-five people. Arvind gets angry if people express any differences with him. If anyone speaks against him, he starts shouting,"" Binny said. Questioning the capacity in which Kejriwal can take the decision of choosing or rejecting a member for Lok Sabha ticket, Binny said, ""How do you arrive at the decision? Are you the sole authority who decides?"" Binny said that 90 per cent of people in Delhi are feeling cheated. Binny feels that the Kejriwal-led AAP is misleading people. Binny said, ""The Aam Aadmi Party has broken the promises which it made to the people before election."" Binny also threatened to go on a hunger strike from January 27 if AAP does not live up to its promises. Talking about the promise of providing 700 litres of free water, Binny said, ""We said 700 litres of water would be given free, but cleverly a clause was added that those who use more than 700 will pay the whole amount."" ""People of Delhi will never forgive a party that went back on its promises. AAP should introspect,"" Binny said. Raking up the issue of Jan Lokpal Bill , Binny said that AAP had promised to pass the bill in 15 days. ""How can you make promises that you don't try to fulfil,"" he questioned. Stating that AAP was not formed to make someone chief minister or MLA, Binny said, ""We came together as a party to help people."" Binny went on to say that he is deeply pained by the allegations being made against him. ""My name was used to woo people to vote for AAP. I had nothing to gain from joining AAP, it was AAP that gained from my name,"" he hit out. Binny had on Wednesday accused the Delhi Government of deviating from its principles and poll promises and called Arvind Kejriwal a ""liar"". Rubbishing the MLA's criticism, Kejriwal had said, ""First, he had come to me for ministership, we refused. After that, he wanted to contest the Lok Sabha polls. He came to my house to ask for the ticket. The party has decided that all sitting MLAs would not be given tickets for the Lok Sabha polls."" Binny had immediately denied demanding either ministership or ticket to contest the Lok Sabha polls, saying it was the ""biggest lie if he (Kejriwal) has made the statement that I went to him for Lok Sabha ticket.

323,"NEW DELHI: In a sign of increasing number of rifts within the Aam Aadmi party (AAP), new entrant Captain Gopinath on Wednesday criticised the Delhi government's move to block retail FDI. ""This move will not help local retailers,"" Gopinath said. Meanwhile, AAP's member Tina Sharma questioned whether the party's sole aim was to work towards 2014 elections. ""I think without catering to the 2013 manifesto we are working on 2014 manifesto. People ask me this,"" Sharma said. Sharma also said that the government had ignored the security of women in Delhi. ""Where are the Mahila commandos, what happened to woman issues?,"" she asked. Gopinath and Sharma's comments are the latest in the line of problems that AAP is facing. Earlier in the day, AAP MLA Vinod Binny had expressed dissatisfaction over the Delhi government's functioning. Binny claimed that the Delhi government is drifting from core issues. ""I will divulge more details in a news conference,"" Binny said. Binny said he was not upset over not becoming a minister and wanted to raise issues in public interest. ""I am not upset over anything. The party is deviating from the main issues. Hence, it is important for us to make them realise that we are in the party for its cause and the issues it raised,"" the MLA said. Soon after the rebellion by Binny, it was reported that national parties are trying to woo the AAP MLA into joining them. ""A national party is looking to rope in Vinod Binny and may offer him a Lok Sabha ticket,"" reported Times Now. However, Binny denied any intention of leaving the party. ""I am an honest foot soldier of AAP. It's not anyone's personal party. There is no question of leaving AAP,"" he said. Reacting to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's claim that he had asked for a Lok Sabha ticket, Binny said, ""If Arvind bhai has said this then its unfortunate, then no one is a bigger liar than him. There was no talk of LS tickets."" ""There are a lot of differences between the promises we made and how it's going to be delivered,"" Binny said. Criticising the Delhi government for its style of functioning, Binny said, ""The issues on the basis of which the party came to power, I feel party is drifting away from it."" Binny also threatened to go on a hunger strike. Kejriwal had hit back at Binny, questioning why the latter had not raised his issues related to the party's functioning in meetings. ""Why didn't Binny speak in yesterday's meet of candidates who had contested Assembly polls if he wanted to on certain issues,"" Kejriwal asked. Stating that Binny wanted a cabinet berth first and recently asked him for Lok Sabha ticket, Kejriwal said, ""Party has decided sitting MLAs won't get ticket for MP post."" Kejriwal said there was a meeting of all 70 candidates who contested the Delhi polls but the MLA did not raise a single point in the meeting. ""I do not know what his intentions are and I do not even want to get into them. We are the most sensitive government towards resolving issues.

324,"MORE ON: Michael Phelps has rejoined the U.S. drug-testing program, the strongest sign yet that heís returning for the 2016 Rio Olympics. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency says Phelps was among the athletes who underwent doping tests in the third quarter, the period ending Sept. 30. He was tested twice. That coincides with Phelpsí longtime coach, Bob Bowman, telling The Associated Press last month the swimming great had resumed occasional training at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Bowman, however, characterized it more as an effort to get in shape than launch a comeback. Still, by subjecting himself to drug testing, Phelps sets himself up to begin competing again by next summer if he chooses. That would give him plenty of time to get in peak condition for the next major meet, the 2015 world championships in Russia, where nearly all of the top swimmers are expected to take part as a steppingstone to the Rio Games the following summer. FINA, the world governing body for swimming, requires an athlete to be tested for at least nine months before taking part in sanctioned events. Phelps has already returned to the pool. Last month, Bowman wrote in a text to the AP, ìHe is occasionally training with the group to get back in shape.î Further stoking speculation about a comeback, Phelps turned up Friday at the Arena Grand Prix event in Minneapolis and, according to Swimming World, even took part in warm-up activities in the diving well. Phelps is the winningest and most decorated athlete in Olympic history. He captured 18 gold medals and 22 medals overall at the last three Summer Games, shattering the previous marks. He is best known for breaking Mark Spitzís record for a single Olympics by winning eight gold medals in Beijing in 2008. He retired at age 27 after winning six more medals at last summerís London Olympics, adamant that he had no intention of competing again. Phelps had long said his goal was to retire from swimming before he turned 30. ìSure, I could come back in another four years. But why?î he said last December, after being honored as AP male athlete of the year. ìIíve done everything I wanted to do. Thereís no point in coming back.î But, as speculation swirled about a possible flip-flop, Phelps softened his stance this past summer. He told the AP during the world championships in Barcelona, ìI donít know whatís going to happen in the future. I donít know whatís going to happen tomorrow.î When asked, yes or no, whether he would compete at the next Olympics, Phelps would say only that he hasnít planned that far ahead in his life. ìI donít know. Weíre in 2013,î he said. ìThereís nothing in the works right now.î Phelps will be 31 at the time of the opening ceremony for the Rio Games ó not that old, really, for todayís top-flight swimmers, who have more opportunities to cash in on their success and can extend their athletic careers well into their 30s. Heck, Dara Torres was 41 when she won three silver medals in Beijing. Phelps doesnít need the money, of course, having earned tens of millions of dollars in endorsements during his career, and he remains a marketable name, even in retirement. If he does come back, it will likely be another case of an athlete who simply missed the thrill of competition, the day-to-day grind of proving himself against other top swimmers. When he retired, Phelps talked longingly about sleeping late and doing what he wanted without dealing with the often-brutal demands of his sport. He opened a chain of swim schools and planned to work more extensively with his foundation, which is devoted to water safety. He had hoped to stoke his fierce competitive side by getting serious about golf, taking part in a television series with famed coach Hank Haney. Phelps even joked that golf, which is returning to the Olympic program in 2016, was the only sport heíd possibly compete in at Rio.",Phelps hints at Olympics return by resuming drug testing | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/11/14/phelps-hints-at-olympics-return-by-resuming-drug-testing/
325,"BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan ó For the first time in history, the Olympic torch will be taken on a spacewalk. The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics torch will be sent to the International Space Station on board a Russian spacecraft this week and astronauts will then carry it outside the station. Hereís a look at the Sochi torch. The Soyuz TMA-11M rocket, adorned with the logo of the Sochi Olympic Organizing Committee and other related artwork, is seen in this long exposure photograph, as the service structure arms are raised into position at the launch pad. Photo: AP/NASA. The torch will travel into Earthís orbit with the next space station crew, who blast off early Thursday from the Russian-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russiaís Mikhail Tyurin, NASAís Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata of Japan are heading to the space station on a Russian Soyuz rocket that has been emblazoned with the emblem of the Sochi Winter Games. For safety reasons, the torch will not burn when itís onboard the space outpost. Lighting it would consume precious oxygen and pose a threat to the crew. The crew will carry the unlit torch around the stationís numerous modules before taking it out on a spacewalk. The Olympic torch has flown into space before ó in 1996 aboard the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis for the Atlanta Summer Olympics ó but it has never yet been taken outside a spacecraft. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazanskiy, who are part of the space stationís current crew, will take the torch into open space Saturday when they venture outside the station. Kotov says they are planning to take the video and photos of the torch, hopefully when the space station flies over Russia and the southern resort of Sochi can be seen in the background. The torch will stay in space for five days until the returning crew takes it back to Earth next Monday, when Russian Fyodor Yurchikhin, NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg and Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency plan to land in Kazakhstan. The four-month Sochi torch relay, which started in Moscow on Oct. 7, is the longest in the history of the Olympics. For most of the 65,000- kilometer (39,000-mile) route, the flame will travel by plane, train, car and even reindeer sleigh, but 14,000 torch bearers are taking part in the relay that stops at more than 130 cities and towns. Last month, the Olympic flame traveled to the North Pole onboard a Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker. Later this month it will sink to the bottom of the worldís deepest lake, Lake Baikal. In February, the torch will be taken to the peak of Mount Elbrus, at 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) the highest mountain in Russia and Europe. The torch will be used to light the Olympic flame at Sochiís stadium on Feb. 7, marking the start of the 2014 Winter Games that run until Feb. 23.",Carrying the Olympic torch into space | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/11/05/carrying-the-olympic-torch-into-space/

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) President Obama's pick to head the Small Business Administration, Maria Contreras-Sweet, is no stranger to small business lending, one of the main tasks of the SBA. Seven years ago, Contreras-Sweet founded ProAmÈrica Bank, and she is still chair of the board. The commercial bank works primarily with the Latino community in the Los Angeles area. ""Not only did she start her own business, they have also been her customers,"" Obama said when he announced her appointment Wednesday. The bank currently has 400 clients, about two-thirds of whom are small business owners, according to CEO Bruce Mills. The rest are individuals and nonprofits. It made $108 million in loans in the first three quarters of 2013. That's a sharp contrast to the $29 billion in loans the SBA made last year. But Mills knows Contreras-Sweet is up to the task. ""She's had hands-on experience with small businesses and knows their needs. She's a perfect fit,"" Mills said. Contreras-Sweet, who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico at a young age, also has public-sector experience. She served as the secretary of the California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency before starting ProAmÈrica Bank. The SBA's primary mission is to help small businesses get access to funding via government-backed loans from private banks. In fiscal year 2013, the agency supported 54,106 loans to small business owners. It also helps small businesses pursue federal contracts and offers disaster loans . Pending Senate approval, Contreras-Sweet will replace Jeanne Hulit at the helm of the SBA. Hulit has served in an interim capacity since September 2013. Her predecessor Karen Mills resigned after four years and is now a fellow at Harvard University.","Community banker nominated to head SBA - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/smallbusiness/contreras-sweet-sba-head/index.html
327,"From his new memoir, ìFaster Than Lightningî (Harper), out next week, four things you didnít know about Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the fastest man alive: In Beijing, he ate 1,000 McNuggets. During the Beijing Olympics, Bolt, then 22, thought that Chinese food was ìodd.î So he hit the nearest McDonaldís in search of his favorite food: chicken McNuggets. ìAt first I ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner. The next day I had two boxes for breakfast, one for lunch and then another couple in the evening. I even grabbed some fries and an apple pie to go with it,î he writes. He estimates that during the 10 days he spent in Beijing, he downed 100 nuggets every 24 hours. That equals 1,000 chunks of chicken. ìMan, I should have gotten a gold medal for all that chowing down,î he writes. His signature move wasnít even his own idea. ìBoltingî is the runnerís go-to celebration, where he pulls his arm back like an archer and aims an imaginary bow at the heavens ó but it wasnít his idea. He first struck this pose when he set the world record in the 100 meters during the Beijing 2008 games. And though it looked off-the-cuff, it was actually planned in advance with a dancer friend from Jamaica. ìIíd made a deal that if I won the 100, I would bust some crazy dance move. It was called ëDi World,í î he writes. Though the move has been criticized for being unsportsmanlike, it hasnít stopped the speedster from busting the move every time he wins a race. He had a ìdonít ask donít tellî policy with his first girlfriend. Bolt was spoken for when he arrived in Beijing, already dating his first serious girlfriend, Jamaican runner Mizicann Evans, for five years. But after becoming an overnight sensation, he found that the ìladies threw themselvesî at him, he writes. ìI was able to get any lady I wanted .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. I could walk into a party and take my pick,î he writes. ìI would go into a club and think, ëHmm, aíight, which one? You .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. ? You .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. ? Oh, you! Letís do this.í<U+2009>î So, how did the couple last? ìWe had one rule: If I was doing my thing with someone else and Mizzi didnít know, then she was cool. But if she found out that something had happened between me and another girl, then that person had to go,î writes Bolt. The couple has since split. A baton nearly got him disqualified. After three first-place finishes at the 2012 London Olympics ó one for the 4◊100 relay ó he decided that gold medals were not enough. He wanted the baton. But the race official looked at him like he was crazy. ì<U+2009>ëYou canít have that. Weíll need it,î the official told Bolt. îWhy? The Olympics is over!î Bolt fired back. The two sparred over the baton in Boltís clutches until the official went ìwildî and threatened him. ìYouíre going to be disqualified if you donít give me back the baton!î the official said. Just as Bolt was about to hand over the prized rod, another official came over and insisted that Bolt keep it. What's Your Take? Being famous & rich overcomes being arrogant & ugly.† Some people will let any celebrity put their penis inside their bodies just so they can ""brag"" (?) about it later.† Groupies have always been around...some just rack up greater scores than others. Sure he's fast, the fastest, even, but why does such a worthless athlete garner so much attention? It would help if he stood for virtue, any virtue, instead of attracting life's lowest common denominator. Being the fastest man on the planet is no small task and I for one salute you for that accomplishment. Two things most men aspire either as a child or as they start into puberty. Fastest man or badest man on planet. Heavyweight champ or Olympic champ. Both are awesome! Bolt is the unquestioned fastest man in the world. I look forward to seeing him race as NO American sprinter is in his league. I'm waiting for the Americans to challenge him for the title of world's fastest man. http://eiphonerepairatlanta.com/ @ jo schmo So it is absurd because you have never strived to push your body to its maximum potential? Just so you know...pro athletes not only contribute far more to society than you do, but they contribute far more to YOUR EMPLOYER than you. Without ever setting foot in your local McDonalds that you call a job. Because it has been proven that relaxed workers are more productive. And watching sports makes people more relaxed.","Usain Bolt: Torrid sex, baton fights and 1,000 Chicken McNuggets | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/11/03/usain-bolt-dishes-on-sex-squabbles-and-mcnuggets/

Cable mogul John Malone, who controls Charter, the No. 4 cable company, with 6.8 million subscribers, has long championed sector consolidation and is seen by Wall Street as dogged in his pursuit of TWC. While many expect Malone to slowly and steadily close in on TWC, few, perhaps, could have expected his battle to get so bitter and personal so quickly. Rutledge did not increase the offer ó instead saying, and displaying charts that he said were proof, that TWCís inflated stock price was the result of Charterís interest. John Bickham, Charterís COO and a former TWC executive, said the Manhattan-based cable company screwed up 10 years of restructuring. ìManagement never had a real vision of what the national organization should look like. Ö How did they go from best to worst?î he asked. Rutledgeís attack is aimed at TWC shareholders, hoping they pressure the board to change its mind. A survey from Macquarie analyst Amy Yong suggested that while few shareholders would accept the current Charter offer, most ó about 97 percent ó believe selling the company to the highest bidder is better than going it alone. Charter also aimed its mighty PR guns at TWC subscribers ó saying a Charter-run Big Apple cable company would offer better service and lower prices. TWC, in a statement, said, ìThere was nothing in Charterís presentation and call today that changes the fact that its proposal is grossly inadequate. We have engaged with Charter, but Charter is not prepared to pay for a one-of-a-kind asset that Tom Rutledge referred to today as the biggest and best M&A option available. We are confident in our stand-alone plan, and we are not going to let Charter steal the company.î",Wires get cross: Charter-TWC spat turning nasty | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/time-warner-cable-shareholders-seek-sale-at-higher-price/
330,"MORE ON: RENTON, Wash. ó In the days leading up to the Dec. 15 game, Giants offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride explained the Seattle defensive backfield was so good in part because the Seahawks hold and grab on every play and it was up to the receivers to fight through the hand-to-hand combat. Those comments by Gilbride were brought up Wednesday to Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman as he and his team prepare for Sundayís NFC Championship against the 49ers. ìI think we cover more than we hold,íí Sherman said. ìI think heís a guy thatís a little bit bitter. His team didnít score any points in that game, so you find a way to explain that to save your job.íí Well, Gilbride, who retired, did not save his job and the 23-0 loss to the Seahawks was perhaps the worst offensive performance in a season full of them. Sherman got two of his eight interceptions in that game ó two of the five the Seahawks got in that defensive masterpiece at MetLife Stadium. One more win and Sherman gets to return to the scene of one of his more memorable performances. If he can help his team get past the 49ers on Sunday, next up for Sherman and the Seahawks is a trip to New York (OK, New Jersey if you want to get technical) for the first outdoor Super Bowl played in a cold-weather city ó a city Sherman figures to be just right for his outsized personality. ìIn terms of New York, I guess weíre a match made in heaven, I guess you could say that,íí Sherman said. ìI guess itís made for the big lights.íí Sherman, a Pro Bowler, specializes in in-your-face press coverage and getting under the skin of receivers with his physical style and ever-present talking. Heís expecting some heavy-duty tension this weekend as these two NFC West rivals square off for the third time this season. ìThereís no love lost, thereís no love found,íí Sherman said ìItís going to be intense, itís going to be physical, I donít know if thereís going to be handshakes after this one. ìI donít hate anybody. But passion definitely, there will be some dislike.

Travel + Leisureís cover boasts ìDream Beaches,î coupled with a bikini-clad lady relaxing with an ocean view. But weíre stunned at the level of oversell. Thereís just six pages of suggested destinations, and itís mostly photographs: the accompanying information is decidedly bite-size. The mag aims at an amusing destination faceoff: Mykonos vs. St. Tropez and a New Post-style tan-o-meter of best places to get brown, with Scotland on one end and Ipanema, Brazil, on the other. We say leave the snark to New Yorkís favorite tabloid. Props to T+L for its fascinating feature on the transformation of ski destination, Tahoe, thanks to the Silicon Valley mini-moguls. Pilar Guzmanís CondÈ Nast Traveler wins gold for the cover most likely to make us leave it on the newsstands. Rather than show a beach or a ski resort, Traveler gives us a corner of Castello di Casole, Tuscany, a top pick in its list of Worldís Best Hotels. Inside lies a different story altogether. Take ìWater Worlds,î a package of breathtaking locations that feature jaw-dropping bodies of water, including Canyon Point, Utah, where the hotel pool literally snakes around an ancient sandstone butte, and the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. We canít help loving the spotlight on much-maligned English food that finally acknowledges the talent beyond pub grub. Most tempting cover award goes to Islands magazine, which lures with teases such as Maldives, Bali and Tahiti. Inside, the editors smartly carve up destinations to suit every interest: the total escape to the best for families to the best views. The photography is top-notch, but the first-person travelogues come off as amateurish compared to more upscale titles. Islands doesnít just do the obvious destinations; it does a good job of seeking out the unique. Take Atlantis Palm, Dubai, where you can sleep with the fishes ó uh no, not what you think ó rather thereís a fish tank at the foot of the bed. The closest National Geographic Traveler gets to beaches is a first-person piece by Andrew McCarthy ó yes, the actor-turned travel writer ó on Honolulu. McCarthy walks us through the vegetation towards a Prada store and on to swimming in the Pacific. But not all of it is positive, as he reveals heís overwhelmed with a desire to get the hell out of there. National Geographic Traveler differs from other travel magazines in that youíre more likely to hear about the goings-on at a local fish market than about the quality of sushi in a top-class restaurant. Only Traveler would recommend 2014 vacation hot spots in Iraq and Sarajevo. Basra this year, anyone?

New Yorkís cover story asserts that, ìWhat adolescence does to adolescents is nowhere near as brutal as what it does to their parents.î This generalization, which, granted, may apply to a large swath of Park Slope, is presented with surprisingly scant irony as a bold new revelation for social science, supported by some guy whoís selling a new book.

Just-released statistics show the magazine industry, drained of ad dollars since the Great Recession, seemed to be finally stabilizing. People racked up 3,183.46 ad pages last year, up 0.9 percent from the previous year. (The numbers werenít enough to save top editor Larry Hackett, though, who was ousted Friday in a corporate shakeup). Peopleís closest rival was its Time Inc. sister title, In Style, a monthly that captured its own fashion-category crown with 2,810.83 ad pages, up 4.7 percent. Total ad revenue for the industry was up 1.1 percent, to $19.7 billion, compared with a year earlier, according to full-year figures released by the Publishers Information Bureau. It was the first time since the recession that total-year ad revenue finished in positive territory. The revenue figure is usually considered a less reliable gauge than ad pages, however, since the calculation is based on the published price for a single ad page. Large multipage advertisers never pay full price. For that reason, the ad-page count has been considered the more reliable barometer of the industryís health ó and by that yardstick the magazine publishing sector posted a 4.1 percent decline, to 145,712.93.

334,"Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks about the number of Apps downloaded during an Apple event in San Francisco. Apple will refund consumers at least $32M to settle a longstanding complaint that the technology company billed US consumers for charges incurred by children buying mobile apps without their parents' consent. Photo: Reuters. MORE ON: WASHINGTON ó Kids gleefully snapped up virtual pet food, gems or other items while playing games on their mobile devices, while bills from Apple mounted, often without parentsí knowledge. Now, the tech giant has agreed to refund the money. Following tens of thousands of consumer complaints, the Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that Apple will pay at least $32.5 million to settle a federal case involving those in-app purchases. Apple also must change its billing practices to make it more obvious that an actual purchase is taking place during a game or app. Just how could a kid buy these things without mom or dadís knowledge and run up bills into the hundreds of dollars or more? A game-player wants to advance to a new level or buy coins, a chest of gems or treats for a virtual pet. It takes a click, and then the app asks for a password. According to the FTC complaint, Apple did not always make it clear that they were buying something. Parents also were not told that entering the password started a 15-minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult, the agency said. A single purchase generally can range from 99 cents to $99, the commission said. One parent told the FTC that her daughter had spent $2,600 in ìTap Pet Hotel,î in which children can build their own pet lodging. The game is free to download and play, but it takes in-app purchases for treats and coins for the pets. Other consumers reported unauthorized purchases by children totaling more than $500 in the apps ìDragon Storyî and ìTiny Zoo Friends.î Apple will have until Mar. 31 to come up with a billing system that ensures it obtains consumersí informed consent before billing them for in-app purchases.",Apple to make $32M payout to parents for kidsí purchases | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/apple-to-make-32m-payout-to-parents-for-kids-purchases/
335,"Nick Romito is the CEO of View the Space, an online real estate company that tracks office inventory for owners and agents. Photo: Lorenzo Ciniglio. When the real estate pros decide to drop a couple of million bucks on a hot property, the neighbors are expected to pay attention. But the millions that are trading hands arenít in Hudson Yards or the new World Trade Center site ó these properties are all in cyberspace. There, a new batch of websites are changing the ways brokers and owners share leasing information, owners seek out contractors and tenants find offices. The websites ó Honest Buildings , View the Space , 42Floors.com and Hightower ó were created because their developers felt their current choices fell short and that good tech could improve the situation. It takes money to develop websites both for engineers and even for their own office spaces and all have found real estate angels to invest in their dreams and make them user-friendly realities. Hereís our roundup of the hot new web sites for the commercial real estate connoisseur. View the Space. View the Space started out with photos and videos to get potential tenant prospects excited about the spaces. But its name and functions have since morphed into a digital drop box for keeping track of spaces, tours, lease proposals and signed lease details across multiple buildings and portfolios. ìOur users are asset managers, portfolio managers and brokers,î explained founder and CEO Nick Romito who now refers to the product as ìVTS.î Building owners pay for the services on a per building basis while their brokers are the power users. The in-house broker uploads all the space and building information so that all the documents, including the leases and proposals, are stored on the site. ìWe become the centralized place for all the data,î Romito said. As a broker for eight years in New York, Romito was juggling so many Excel spread sheets and notes about space tours, tenants and availabilities for the buildings he was responsible for that he developed View the Space to easily keep track of the paperwork, leads and stages of the deals. Seven million dollars in financing was just obtained from Trinity Ventures, along with Thomas Byrne, an early backer of Loopnet and others. The site is headquartered in New York but available in 14 cities where it streamlines the leasing process through HD video tours, targeted distribution and real-time analytics. More cities are coming in the future. The VTS offices are on a full floor of 360 Seventh Ave. ó right next door to Romitoís apartment building. Eloise his small dog, tags along on his short commute to where 20 employees are packed into the space. Honest Buildings. Honest Buildings is a site that brothers Josh and Jared Kushner of Thrive Capital have sunk their funds into ó some $4 million along with other investors. It solves a simple problem: How do you find someone competent to do X at your property? ìXî can mean a lot. Have an historical landmark that needs iron work?†HonestBuildings will offer up companies through a simple search function. The site should really be called Honest Contractors because browsing is free and finding engineers, architects and other skilled firms is easy. Figuring out who is a good match means clicking into the formal referral portion called HB Match, which does entail speaking with a rep and can take a few days. But the user is never charged. The screened matchup is then made to, in this case, appropriate architects and iron specialists, who each send back between a 2 and 5 percent referral fee to HB if they win the contract. Just like LinkedIn and Facebook, real estate executives can also list themselves with their photos and send messages to each other through the site. Although New York-centered, both companies and individuals are listed from around the globe. One search quirk is that as the right search bar is used to scroll down through the numerous companies and people, the bar will suddenly jump up as more companies pop into view. 42Floors. 42Floors.com, an office listing website, whose name is based off of ìThe Hitchhikerís Guide to the Galaxy.î Entrepreneur Jason Freedman was so frustrated by searching for office space in San Francisco for previous startups, that he actually became a broker to learn more about the industry. Eventually, he decided he could do it better and more intuitively. That insight led to the development of 42Floors.com ó a name chosen from the Douglas Adams novel, ìThe Hitchhikerís Guide to the Galaxyî wherein ì42î was the ìAnswer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.î Listings are free for the listing brokers and owners. Once a prospective tenant clicks that they are ready to see a space and fills out their information, customer service reps will call back to pre-qualify the tenant. Rather than just focusing on the exteriors of commercial buildings, 42Floors is filled with interior images of the spaces that are available to lease. All the photography is provided free to the brokers. ìNo one has gone to more lengths to put pictures on line,î said Freedman, who has also partnered with View the Space to use that websiteís space tour videos. Tenants are referred to 42Floorsí partner brokers to do what brokers do best: provide information about the space and building along with the pricing if it is held back from the listing. Because 42Floors is technically a brokerage, their income is derived through fees from the tenantís new broker and advertising. Hightower. Hightower is a Web and mobile platform aimed at following leasing deals along with other documents and building info, and provides real-time analytics. All the data can be imported into Excel while leasing information such as floor plans for spaces can be shared. Founder Brandon Weber is a techie who came out of Microsoftís Excel and Zillow before joining CBRE in Seattle. Weber founded the now New York-based company last year with cloud expert Niall Smart and web designer Donald DeSantis who is connected to music industry technology companies and also did a stint as a real estate broker.

Macklowe has previously tackled ice hockey and ice climbing ó he conquered the 14,410-foot Mount Rainier in Washington State ó but says balance sports have always appealed to him. He grew up skateboarding, started windsurfing at the age of eleven, and has sailed all his life. Kiteboarding has a sailing component to it, he said, but with a ìdifferent rush because you are going about 25 miles per hour on a little board.î He adds, ìAll these sports are technical, they require a fair amount of analysis, an understanding of the situation and how to execute, commitment and fortitude. To me, thatís no different than investing in New York real estate.î Macklowe also plays his ìobligatoryî golf game which, like tennis, is the chosen leisure activity of many real estate executives. Christine Gagliardi, managing director of business development for TitleVest Agency, admits sheís a ìterribleî golf player for whom no amount of lessons were able to fix. After a colleague suggested sporting clays ó shooting clay targets going in various directions at different heights with a shotgun ó Gagliardi took some classes at Orvis Sandanona in upstate Millbrook. She realized she had found her calling. Now, instead of cocktails, Gagliardi brings together people over clays. These small outings with four to five people are a unique way to entertain and network with her clients. ìI try to match up personalities when Iím arranging these excursions,î Gagliardi explained. ìI also introduce them to other people who can help them grow their business. Thatís what I really enjoy. And itís a great networking tool.î Gagliardiís guests get to know her and her humor, observe her tenacity and follow-through and are encouraged by the group as they break or just miss the clays.

He learned to shoot while a youngster at camp in Pennsylvania, but when he grew up and visited a friend in Dutchess County who took him out varmint hunting, Lichtenberg was hooked. Heís now hunted in New Mexico, Colorado, Maine, Pennsylvania, New York and Florida, as well as in Scotland and Argentina. Along with various birds, he has also shot bear, elk, deer, wild pig and alligator. ìWhen we are not hunting we are fishing,î Lichtenberg says.

China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua said that already multi-millions of Appleís iPhones have been ordered by its customers, signaling strong demand for the device. Appleís iPhones will begin selling at China Mobile, the worldís largest carrier by subscribers, starting Friday.

The new cooperation with China Mobile is the last piece of the puzzle for Apple in the country, officially making the iPhones available through all three of Chinaís state-run telecom carriers. Though neither Apple nor China Mobile would comment on the exact terms of the deal, Apple is likely to get a considerable bump from China Mobile, which analysts expect to spend generously on marketing and handset subsidies to sell the iPhones. The cooperation also massively expands the reach of Appleís sales channels in China, making the iPhones available in China Mobileís thousands of stores that range across the country from large cities to tiny hamlets.","New Apple, China Mobile deal goes beyond iPhones | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/new-apple-china-mobile-deal-goes-beyond-iphones/
338,"There is no question about it ó land prices are up and that is causing some angst to bankers as they add up just how much money they can lend on a deal. ìWe are looking at the cost basis, and we have to agree with that value,î explained Jenna Gerstenlauer, founder and managing partner of Sound Mark Partners. ìIf someone is buying a building and paying several hundred dollars a foot and knocking it down, it adds to your cost.î Sound Mark, based in Greenwich, Conn., is raising funds and then investing in debt in mortgages. ìThe deals that make the most sense,î she added, ìare where they acquired the deal in last five years ó those tend to work.î A year ago they closed a transaction where the pro-forma for the future residential condominium sales was $2,000 a foot. They got comfortable with the numbers and later sales came in at $2,500 to $3,000 a foot. ìItís a granular analysis,î she said. ìYou have to know the buyerî ó that is, the developer/sponsor of the condominium site. She also frowns on potential borrowers who provide an analysis that predicts the sales three years later at numbers never before achieved. ìYou want a mix of units and want it affordable so that you are not counting on the 1 percent of the 1 percent to be the buyers,î Gerstenlauer explained. ìFor a builder, you need to sell them, and if you are long with seven units selling for $7 million each, you have a problem.î At a Crainís forum in November, Alan Wiener, managing director at Wells Fargo remarked, ìWe forget what happened four and five years ago. I scratch my head about rating agencies and what they didnít learn.î He said Wells Fargo has to price competitively, and because of the size of the deals, they sometimes have to be syndicated. ìWe will do loans up to $150 million so we will have to syndicate to button them up,î he said. ìThey have to have reasonable returns to make sure other banks will come in and do business with you.î The chief investment officer for developer Taconic Partners, Kevin Davis, said at the same forum that construction loans require recourse ó which means if the developer defaults, someoneís piggy bank could be on the line. For a $300 million project with $200 million in debt, the lender will require a lot of equity and a repayment guarantee. ìIf we canít pay it back you have to go into our personal checkbooks,î Davis said. Ari J. Hirt, Director in the Debt & Equity Finance Group at Mission Capital Advisors, said the company arranges financial partners that could be institutional investors, such as opportunity or pension funds, or even families with cash, to provide the debt and equity needed by his client developers. He says CMBS lenders are now very active and have become more aggressive in locking down deals in New York. ìYou can get 70 to 75 percent LTV,î he said of the loan-to-value ratio. ìClients are coming to us because we are out in the market and can find the right lender for the right deal,î Hirt said. Their TriBeCa office has no walls and is set up ìlike a newspaper officeî so employees can cross-pollinate to make matches ó such as bringing in new banks to the city. But it is hard to forecast ahead because there are so many variables. ìWe just hope interest rates are low and the world situation remains stable so we can continue to do deals and there are no economic or military crises,î Hirt said. ìTread lightly, because if there is a condo boom and the music stops, the first to suffer will be those projects in not a great location; the others will eventually sell out,î Davis warned. Gertenlauer notes they are making investments ìon a very cautious basisî in the major US food groups of office, hotel, retail and industrial, with a small appetite outside the US. ìWe could slip back into a downturn in a month or this cycle could last for years,î she added.",Spiking land prices complicate commercial financing | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/spiking-land-prices-complicate-commercial-financing/
339,"Which is why the new book ìCubed: A Secret History of the Workplaceî is such a revelatory read. Set for release this spring and written by n+1 magazine editor Nikil Saval, ìCubedî delves into the complex history of office spaces. Starting with the pre-Civil War ìmercantileî era continuing on to the rise of the skyscraper, delving into the arrival of ìopen-planî offices and ending with the high-tech ìtelecommutingî offices of the present (and future), Saval deftly links the evolution of business, politics, cultural mores and technology with old-fashioned architecture and interior design. We spoke to Saval about his book ó and his fascinating topic. Why do offices still matter ó particularly in this age of telecommuting? Offices are now chiefly places where meetings happen and where many people get their best work done. For some folks, lawyers for instance, offices provide a structure unavailable at home. Offices are also important for building a sense of company culture ó which is an intangible measure of organization, cooperation and mutual understanding. What is the dominant trend now in office design? The dominant ideology remains open-plan offices ó which is hardly a new thing, but rather an older concept pioneered by German designers more than 50 years ago. But despite their popularity with companies, open-plan offices are not always favored by actual workers. People surveyed often find them noisy and lacking privacy ó as places that are difficult to concentrate and hard to focus. At 650 Madison Ave, spaces are being used for conferences instead of offices. Photo: Lorenzo Ciniglio. So why the continued prevalence of open-plan designs? Bosses find them conducive for serendipitous encounters and increased social interactivity ó even if this is not always the case in reality. Open-plan offices also offer financial benefits ó which is another reason they prevail. Are offices reflections of their companies? Offices today are more reflections of a companyís founders ó and their founding vision ó than the majority of actual workers, often reflecting systems of hierarchy and control. But surely, there must be offices that do consider workers as much as employers? For sure. During my research, I looked at the offices of companies such as GitHub, which is based in San Francisco, and Interpolis, which is located in Holland and found that their offices were really well thought-out and considered. These are the kinds of companies that make room for the sheer variety of work now taking place in offices while simultaneously not insisting that folks actually come into the office to work. This is really office-design at its most progressive. With the rise of telecommuting and shared-work, will offices ever become obsolete? Well, as long as real estate speculation encourages the development of new office towers, offices will always remain popular. In fact, even though we now have more office space than we know what to do with, new offices are still being built. Still, the way we use offices is shifting. The growth of casualized labor, for instance, has made the notion of ìsingle-tenantî offices less relevant and less financially justifiable. A presentation area at 1 WTC. Photo: Lois Weiss. What else is affecting offices today? Shared offices are really shifting how we think of the work-place ó as evidenced by projects such as Grid70 in Grand Rapids, Mich., which is more of a ìcreative hubî than conventional office environment. These types of projects speak to offices as no longer containers for single organizations. Rather, theyíre places to generate creative ideas. And what about technology? What technology does is allow folks today to work anywhere ó not just in the office. And what this means is a shift in the notions of productivity and assertion of autonomy. Technology says I donít need to necessarily work while being watched by the boss. Rather, I need to work in a way ó and in a place ó where I can get my best work done!",Gleaming the cube: How office spaces shape our work | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/gleaming-the-cube-how-office-spaces-shape-our-work/
340,"PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. ó Hal Steinbrenner said Wednesday that he spoke recently with Casey Close, the agent for Japanese free-agent pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, to ìexpress that heís a great player. A lot of respect for him.î Close, who represents Yankees captain Derek Jeter and many other high-profile players, has succeeded so far in keeping his Tanaka negotiations remarkably private. Steinbrenner, here at the Major League Baseball ownersí meetings at the Sanctuary Camelback Mountain Resort, wouldnít even address a question of whether a Yankees contingent met with Tanaka during the right-handerís recent visit to the United States. Yet Steinbrenner made clear how badly the Yankees want to add Tanaka, whom they scouted extensively last season, to their starting rotation. ìI think a lot of teams are interested,î said Steinbrenner, the Yankeesí managing general partner. ìThis is a great, young pitcher. Iím sure heíll come here and do great things with someone. We certainly have an interest. I believe we need another starter. But weíll see what happens.î The Dodgers are viewed as the Yankeesí prime competitor, the Dodgers signed ace Clayton Kershaw to a seven-year, $215 million extension . Itís clear that if the Yankees sign Tanaka, their 2014 payroll will surpass the $189 million luxury-tax threshold, which they had desired to stay under. If Tanaka signs elsewhere, the Yankees have a chance to meet their payroll goal. Either way, Steinbrenner said, the payroll goal hasnít and wonít impact the Yankeesí pursuit of Tanaka. And if they donít get Tanaka, Steinbrenner said, the Yankees will look at other free-agent options, though they arenít believed to be enthusiastic about free agents Bronson Arroyo, Matt Garza, Ubaldo Jimenez or Ervin Santana. Joe Torre, MLBís executive vice president of baseball operations, said he remained hopeful of adding expanded instant replay for the 2014 season, including the ìchallengeî system for managers. However, Torre hinted the additions might not be as dramatic as initially anticipated. Specifically, all safe/out calls may not be subject to replay. ìThe one thing I can say is, Iíd rather add more later than to have too much of it really affect our game,î Torre said. He indicated that adding safe/out calls on plays at the plate was the first priority. In the collective bargaining agreement approved during the 2011-12 offseason, the owners and players signed off on adding fair/foul boundary calls as well as trap plays in the outfield. Those figure to be the basis of the new system. As Fox Sports reported last week, the players have yet to sign off on either expanded replay or a change in the rule on home-plate collisions. Should the Yankees go all out for Tanaka? I said it in the past! Hal Steinbrenner is the man that needs to take charge of this negotiations process with Tanaka and any player or situation he really desires. I have NOOOOOO FAITH!!!!! In Brian Cashman whatsoever! If Hal Steinbrenner steps in to handle this negotiation that means so much to him my guess is that he feels somewhat the same. IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!! With that notion I truly hope Cashman and his goons days are numbered! By the way SIZEMORE is just another of many ""what the hell is he doing""? moves by the twirp! YES ! ! !†††† The Yankees should go all out for Tanaka; they should pull out all the stops to get him.†† The Yanks should go all out in an effort to show Tanaka that he is definitely†wanted in New York, and how he would be treated with the respect due a star of his caliber. That's why you will be watching the playoffs next year and not in them. Go spend another 150 mil stupidly on tanaka and with the rest of those old past their prime players the yanks seem to covet its going to be another long season for the worst run team in MLB. @ Jim Dimacher go comment in the Boston Globe, stay the heck out of our papers. †Boston wins 3 world titles since 1918 and now they are the the elite of baseball? †Gimmie a break, as if Big Slopp Papi isn't using PED's. By the way, can you tear down that raggedy azz joke of a ballpark? †It looks like a little league diamond with that bogus green wall. Stop frightening yourself Jim Dimacher. The Yankees almost made it to the playoffs last year sitting in a wheelchair. They don't necessarily need Tanaka. Without Tanaka they would probably go after 200 innings from what's left on the FA market and almost be forced to finally give one of their own candidates a worthy shot. In fact as I wouldn't mind taking a shot at getting Tanaka I don't see it as the end of the world if the Yankees don't. I like what I've seen in Ken Phelps and some of the other buried candidates that rarely get a chance! This upcoming season we have a stronger and speed bursting lineup with pop (even without Canoe). I can see this lineup has much more offense and flexibility. The wheelchairs will be gone so have plenty cold beers to keep yourself numb to what's about to happen to your team when my Yankees come to your town and beat the living craps out of them.

341,"TAMPA ó The Yankees have their sights set on Masahiro Tanaka and nothing figures to change that until the Japanese star finds a home in the majors. Still, the teamís single-mindedness toward adding Tanaka to its rotation doesnít mean everyone in the organization is sold on him. ìJust because he had great success over there doesnít mean heís going to be lights out here,î one official said. ìWeíll find out soon enough, but itís not like heís a sure-fire thing. Iíd like to think so, but Iím not convinced.î But heís enough of a solid bet the Yankees have done little more than check in on free-agent starters such as Ubaldo Jimenez and Ervin Santana. The organization remains unimpressed with this free-agent class of starters, including Matt Garza and Bronson Arroyo. Though there are different views of just how good Tanaka can be in the majors, there is a unanimous consensus the rotation needs an upgrade to go along with CC Sabathia, Ivan Nova and Hiroki Kuroda. ìIf you donít get Tanaka, it kind of nullifies some of what youíve added to the offense,î one AL official said. ìAnything is possible, but Iím sure they really donít want to lose [Tanaka].î Thanks to the savings they got from Alex Rodriguezís suspension, the Yankees have all the more reason to go hard after Tanaka, even with the goal of staying under the $189 million luxury-tax threshold. With a deadline of Jan. 24 looming, many believe Tanaka and agent Casey Close will wait until that date approaches before making a deal, letting the Yankees, Dodgers and any other teams that choose to stay in the fray drive the price up. The five Yankees eligible for arbitration all filed Tuesday: David Robertson, Brett Gardner, Ivan Nova, Francisco Cervelli and Shawn Kelley. The sides will exchange figures Friday. Gardner could still end up being traded if the Yankees fail to land Tanaka and decide to move the outfielder for a starting pitcher.

343,"What's the deal with crowdfunding investments? Rick Field, owner of Brooklyn-based Rick's Picks, can publicly solicit investors thanks to a rule change made under the JOBS Act. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) A rule changed in September that transformed the way small business owners can seek investment, but it appears to be flying under the radar. The new rule allows private companies to publicly advertise that they are seeking investment, known as ""general solicitation."" Part of the JOBS Act , it aims to make it easier for smaller companies to access new investors and raise capital -- something a majority say is their biggest challenge. For the past 80 years, startups that wanted to raise money couldn't publicly say they were seeking investment. They couldn't mention it at speaking engagements, post an announcement on their website or tweet about it. That's all changed. ""I've seen an entirely new class of individuals taking a look at my business now,"" said Rick Field, CEO of Rick's Picks, a New York-based company selling specialty pickles and beets. Field -- one of the small number of business owners to take advantage of the new rule -- has seen three times the traffic to his fundraising profile on the crowdfunding site CircleUp. Though he says it's too early to tell if that will lead to more investment, more and more people are discovering Rick's Picks -- and they could become investors down the line. Shahab Kaviani is the CEO of CoFoundersLab, an online matchmaking platform connecting entrepreneurs with business partners. He also took advantage of the rule change in September by tweeting and blogging about his fundraising campaign. Since then, Kaviani has received about $150,000 in investments, and he says half of those investors were the result of general solicitation. ""It's really going to help startups all around. They can sell out loud, which is going to give them more exposure, more quickly,"" said Alejandro Cremades, CEO of the crowdfunding platform Rock the Post. His website launched in 2012 and helps startups raise funds. Unlike crowdfunding sites Kickstarter or Indiegogo, Rock the Post allows entrepreneurs to sell shares, as does CircleUp, a site for consumer product companies. Only about one-third of the 66 startups currently using Rock the Post have taken advantage of the general solicitation rule, while just six of 34 companies on CircleUp are using it. Advertising for investment really only works well for businesses with a tangible product like pickles, or those with an already established social network, said Cremades. The National Federation of Independent Businesses and the Small Business Majority are not yet tracking the extent that small firms are using general solicitation. That may be because the JOBS Act in its entirety has yet to take effect. Although the new rule allows business owners to tell the world they're raising capital, that doesn't mean they can take money from just anybody. Only accredited investors -- those who have a net worth of more than $1 million or have earned $200,000 in each of the previous two years -- can pony up funds. The burden to verify these investors is placed on the fundraiser. And once a business owner opts to solicit publicly -- done by filing out a fairly straightforward form with the SEC -- he or she can't take any funds from a non-accredited investor, which means passing up investments from family or friends they might otherwise have received. The SEC is eventually expected to loosen that limitation. ""General solicitation is a step in the right direction, but without that second part we're still not opening up to a broader population,"" said Rhett Buttle, vice president at the Small Business Majority. Ryan Caldbeck, the CEO at CircleUp, believes the rule change is significant regardless. There are millions of inactive investors that already meet accreditation standards, he said. The change helps small business owners reach them.","What's the deal with crowdfunding investments? - Jan. 7, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/07/smallbusiness/crowdfunding-investments/index.html
344,"The Yankees have made Masahiro Tanaka their top offseason pitching priority, and though not everyone is sold he can be an ace or that he will hold up after being ridden hard in seven seasons with Rakuten, one former Yankee who has played with Tanaka through most of his career believes he would do just fine in the majors. Rasner spent parts of three seasons with the Yankees, the last in 2008. Since then, he has been with Rakuten, where he has most recently been pitching out of the bullpen. ìHe doesnít need to prove anything else [in Japan],î Rasner said. ìHe almost at times goes easy and just plays with [hitters]. Heíll go out there and get guys out at 70 percent. I just think heís really special, super fun watching him.î With the rest of their plans on hold until they get a better idea of where they stand in the Tanaka sweepstakes, as well as how much they are going to owe Alex Rodriguez following arbitrator Fredric Horowitzís ruling on the appeal of A-Rodís 211-game suspension, their primary focus is on landing the 25-year-old right-hander, who went 24-0 with a 1.27 ERA in 2013. Rasner said Tanaka continues to improve. ìThis year I saw him learn how to mess with guysí timing,î Rasner said. ìHe would do a quick pitch, change speeds. He really has a good feel right now of what heís doing.î Though Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and Tanakaís agent, Casey Close, have kept in touch since Tanaka became a free agent last month, no meetings have been set up. Nevertheless, the process will have to move fairly quickly once it gets underway, because there is a Jan. 24 deadline to sign the Japanese star and pay his former Rakuten team the $20 million posting fee. Rasner, who went 5-10 with the Yankees in 2008, said he is confident Tanaka is worth the investment. ìYou see this with some pitchers, they have this extra gear,î Rasner said. ìI donít have that extra gear, and itís really fun watching these pitchers that when they get in trouble they can go up that extra bit and get outs that way with just pure stuff.î Still, he joined the chorus of those cautioning about the amount of pitches Tanaka has thrown. ìI would always tell him to try to knock his workload down, but the guys in Japan, they donít think that way,î Rasner said. ìI think that his size [6-foot-2] and body are different than other Japanese players, so heís able to handle the load a little better. But certainly thereís always some worry of them throwing too much. Thatís the only thing they know, especially Tanaka ó he wants that ball, and he wants to keep the ball, itís really hard to get the ball from him.î Rasner said he doesnít expect Tanaka to be overwhelmed by the spotlight, if he ends up in The Bronx. ìNew York is a tough market, but I think by him pitching in Japan he has had the entire country watching him, so I really donít think itís going to be a huge deal,î Rasner said. He told the owner and baseball people of the Golden Eagles that he wanted to challenge his ability and test his skills with MLB. Either he smells the money or really wants the chance to compete at the best level or both. IF HE REALLY WANTS TO MEET THE CHALLENGE then there is no better place for that than coming to New York! If it's a challenge he wants then he'll surely get one by becoming a Yankee! We'll see what his agenda becomes! A CHALLENGE OR THE MONEY?

345,"Masahiro Tanaka has finally arrived in the United States and is expected to meet with multiple MLB teams ó including the Yankees ó over the next few days, according to a source. Tanaka, the coveted Japanese free-agent righty, flew into Los Angeles on Wednesday night and reportedly had a physical Thursday. He is planning to meet with as many as 10-to-12 teams, although itís unclear if all the meetings will take place in L.A. Details of the sit-downs remain a closely guarded secret, but other teams interested in the 25-year-old Rakuten star ó who easily ranks as the marketís top starting pitcher ó also include the Dodgers, Diamondbacks, Cubs, White Sox and perhaps the Mariners and Blue Jays. Tanaka must strike a deal by Jan. 24 after being posted on Christmas. The reason so many teams are lining up for the chance to speak with Tanaka and his agent, Casey Close, is clear. While there is always a risk in signing pitchers from Japan, Tanaka is younger than others to make the leap to the majors, and scouts rave about his arsenal and his makeup. He went 24-0 with a 1.27 ERA in 2013. One of the lone concerns regarding Tanaka is the heavy workload he had while with Rakuten (1,315 innings in seven seasons, as well as a high pitch count), but teams will still likely offer him a contract in the six-year, $100 million range, if not higher. The team that signs Tanaka will also pay a $20 million posting fee to the Rakuten Golden Eagles, his former team. Although the Yankees are seen as among the favorites to land Tanaka, one official warned the same was true of Robinson Cano until Seattle entered the fray. ìWhen the Yankees want someone ó and they want this guy ó they usually get him,î the official said. ìBut thatís not always the case anymore.î Infielder Jayson Nix agreed to a minor league deal with the Rays. Nix spent the last two seasons with the Yankees and was one of the many to fill in at third base in the absence of Alex Rodriguez and Kevin Youkilis. The Yankees have already signed Kelly Johnson and Brian Roberts to go along with Eduardo Nunez as they prepare for life without Cano and perhaps Rodriguez. Mark Reynoldsí return remains a possibility. I thought the Bankees were going to become role models for fiscal sanity? If Tanaka signs with the Yankees then everything that Ca$hman, Levine and the other flunkies in their front office have been spewing about payroll reduction and avoiding the luxury tax is simply bull, and nothing they ever say from this point forward is to be taken seriously. Why even meet with Tanaka when for two years you've been claiming you are finally putting limits on your payroll? No. we don't need him because he is way too overrated. Kei Igawa, three times Strikeout champion in Japan and the winner of Sawamura award, couldn't perform well because the ball is very different and he couldn't adjust it. Many others couldn't adjust it either (Kawakami etc). There is no way to predict if the same thing won't happen with Tanaka. Darvish was an EXCEPTION, not the rule. UGH! The Yankees†just want to continue to spread†their†brand globally. Get ratings on YES and gin up interest at home to fill that stadium. Whether this pig in a poke can win is secondary. Can we ever just get good baseball here without a circus and gimmicks? There will be one of these in Japan every season now and it is all a set up. What he was pitching against is a joke compared to the MLB and the winner of his services will be a big loser in the end just like with Matsuzaka, Igawa and Wang. This guy is not close to Darvish pitching and never will be. Japan knows how to fish in MLB for the cash. And they had no intention of holding this scam back in Japan for another year as they are already setting up their next one. WATCH! @ day tripper I can agree with that to an extent. †They want to win too, let's not forget about that and they know their farm system stinks so this is the easiest way to get a good (?), young pitcher who will not cost them anything but money. Like you, I'm leery of pitchers from Japan (still can't manage to get Igawa out of my memory) but this guy looks like he could be a decent number 3 or 4 starter. †I'd rather see the Yanks spend some of the money us fans fork over this way then bring back Bartolo Colon.","Masahiro Tanaka in the U.S. to meet with Yankees, others | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/09/masahiro-tanaka-in-the-u-s-to-meet-with-yankees-others/

(Thereís actually no such law. But there should be.) With the holidays fully behind us, letís reboot (or deboot , as they put it in Sunday nightís episode of ìThe Simpsonsî) and see whatís left in this baseball offseason. This figures to be the busiest January in recent memory. The Hall of Fame. That topic is expected to dominate this week, with the announcement coming Wednesday and a news conference with the inductee(s) Thursday in Manhattan. Here is my ballot . Last month on YESí ìYankees Hot Stove,î I predicted Craig Biggio and Greg Maddux would be the two inductees. Based on the 133 full ballots that have been publicized and calculated by Repoz of Baseball Think Factory, itís looking like I shot too low; right now, Tom Glavine and Frank Thomas would join Biggio and Maddux. Alex Rodriguez. As The Postís Joel Sherman mentioned last month, if Fredric Horowitzís announcement didnít come earlier in the month, it probably wonít arrive until after the Hall of Fame announcements . Though neither Major League Baseball nor the Players Association can absolutely control Horowitzís timing, itís common sense that if a request is made to hold off, heíll hold off. Baseball wants as much publicity as possible for its Hall of Fame class, especially after last yearís BBWAA ballot shutout. It doesnít want air time and newspaper/website space being compromised by A-Rod news. And the union doesnít want its newly elected Hall of Fame players being bombarded with queries about their reactions to A-Rod news. So thatís that. Anyway, Iím sticking to my guess that A-Rodís 211-game suspension will be reduced to either 150 or 162 games. I think Anthony Bosch earned his side of his deal with MLB by providing strong testimony ó of the same ilk that already nailed 13 players ó and by documenting multiples usages of multiple drugs, which will get A-Rod far more than the 50 games doled out to a first-time offender for a positive test. But I donít think baseball substantiated its contention that A-Rod obstructed the investigation. Such a suspension would give the Yankees a realistic chance to stay under the $189 million luxury-tax threshold for 2014. Well, unless they sign Masahiro Tanaka, which they very much want to do. Tanaka. This goes back to the old baseball adage: ìWhen the Yankees really want someone, they get him.î Thereís no sense out of Yankees camp the team is going to draw any sort of financial line with this guy. Theyíre in desperation mode after missing the playoffs, and they badly need another frontline starting pitcher while a) not loving any of Matt Garza, Ubaldo Jimenez or Ervin Santana; and b) not having the trade chips to get someone from another team. Tampa Bay wouldnít trade David Price within the American League East unless it was a ridiculously lopsided deal, anyway. Hence Tanaka, whom they scouted extensively and really like. Is it possible, say, the Mariners bring the sweepstakes to a level at which the Yankees arenít comfortable, outbidding the Yankees for the second time this offseason? Sure. Thatís not a great bet, though. We know the Yankees are far more excited about landing Tanaka than they were about retaining Robinson Cano. Going back to the first paragraph of this section: The only time in recent memory the Yankees didnít get someone they really wanted was with Cliff Lee three years ago. It turned out Lee, a free agent following the 2010 season, absolutely loved his brief stay in Philadelphia for about three months in 2009 and couldnít wait to get back there. We know very little about Tanakaís personal beliefs and desires, besides that he wants to pitch in MLB. But given that Lee was the outlier, Iíll stick with thinking Tanaka winds up a Yankee. The other guys. Just as we did a year ago, we have a group of comp free agents (free agents who turned down a one-year, $14-million qualifying offer and therefore require the signing team to forfeit a draft pick) going into January without a deal: Jimenez, Santana, Nelson Cruz, Stephen Drew and Kendrys Morales. Weíll deal with that specific issue in the coming weeks. For now, though, itís clear the markets for the pitchers have been compromised as much by the Tanaka situation, if not more so, as by the draft-pick compensation issue. Garza doesnít even require a draft pick to sign him. The good news for Garza, Jimenez and Santana is the Tanaka saga has an express timeline. By Jan. 24, heíll be obligated to sign with an MLB club or return to the Rakuten Golden Eagles. So Garza, Jimenez and Santana, if they indeed wait out Tanaka, will have about three weeks to find employment before spring training begins. Your Pop Quiz Answers: 1. Bob Meusel 2. Randy Johnson 3.

347,"TRENTON, N.J. ó New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will propose extending the public school calendar and lengthening the school day in a speech he hopes will help him rebound from an apparent political payback scheme that threatens to damage his second term and could cut short any ambitions to run for president. According to excerpts of his State of the State address obtained by The Associated Press, Christie, an early front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, will make the case Tuesday that children who spend more time in school graduate better prepared academically. Details of the plan will be left for another day. Christie, who won re-election by 22 points in a Democrat-leaning state, hopes to regain his footing after being shaken by revelations that key aides orchestrated massive traffic backups by closing lanes near the George Washington Bridge, one of the worldís busiest spans. Four Christie loyalists have been fired or resigned for the apparent political vendetta against a Democratic mayor who wouldnít endorse Christie. The governor apologized , and during a lengthy news conference last week said he was ìblindsidedî by his staffís involvement. Two state legislative panels announced plans Monday to continue their investigations into the incident one Democratic leader now is calling an ìabuse of powerî probe. The U.S. Attorneyís office also is reviewing the apparent political vendetta, possibly to target a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse Christie for re-election. The mayor, Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, told the AP Monday he was asked by a Christie operative to endorse the governor but never responded with a definitive answer after saying he would consider the request. Christie has denied any knowledge in the planning or execution of the plot, and there is no evidence linking him to it. Recently released emails, many from private accounts, show some in Christieís circle were told about the traffic jams days or weeks after they happened. Christieís proposal to lengthen school could antagonize an old adversary, the powerful public teachers union, which he has clashed with over pension and tenure changes. An overhaul of public employee retirement benefits by Christie and the Legislature in 2011 was bitterly opposed by the union, which spent millions in anti-Christie ads during his gubernatorial campaigns. The education plan is the latest from a governor who has sought to retool schooling in grades kindergarten through 12 with mixed success so far. Christie successfully overhauled century-old teacher tenure rules, essentially eliminating lifetime job protections. But the Democrat-led Legislature has not gone along with his voucher plan, which would allow children in failing schools to attend classes elsewhere, including at private or parochial schools. Christie also is expected to revive the theme of bipartisanship, which has taken a hit in the scandal. While Christie has sought to package himself as someone willing to reach across the aisle to get things done, in contrast to politicians in Washington, the traffic plot exposed the petty partisan politics being practiced by some of his aides. Christie is set to be inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 21. The celebration will be on Ellis Island, historically a gateway for immigrants arriving in the United States.",Christie proposes longer school day amid Bridgegate scandal | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/christie-proposes-longer-school-day-amid-bridgegate-scandal/
348,"Chris Christie: Can corporate America's candidate get out of this jam? It was a snowy December day in New York City when a few dozen of the rich and mighty gathered in a private room at a posh Midtown eatery for lunch. In attendance was enough political and financial wattage to constitute a Bilderberg quorum: J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, legendary Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the future former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg; the list went on. At one of the tables the talk turned to politics -- and speculation about who would carry each party's banner into the next presidential election. There was easy consensus for Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee, but what about for the Republicans? ""Chris Christie,"" pronounced Ken Langone, the billionaire founder of Home Depot and a major booster of the New Jersey governor. That drew a quick objection from Vernon Jordan, the Democratic superlawyer and quintessential Friend of Bill from the Clinton years. ""He's a bully,"" Jordan said. Langone returned the volley: ""It's Christie!"" Jordan countered: ""He's a bully. He's a bully."" It's worth noting that this good-natured schoolyard squabble came a month before the revelation that Christie aides had engineered those Fort Lee, N.J., traffic snarls around the George Washington Bridge, apparently for political retribution, setting off a national firestorm and prompting career-threatening questions about the New Jersey governor's role. Jordan, it seems, was awfully prescient. But at the lunch the real question wasn't about Christie's temperament. Rather, it was about how a moderate, even a blustery one, could secure the nod of a rightward-lurching party. For that, Langone had a wordless reply, rubbing his thumb and fingers together to indicate the flood of money that will sweep Christie through.","Chris Christie: Can corporate America's candidate get out of this jam? - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/leadership/chris-christie-jam.pr.fortune/index.html
349,"Marty Chavez: A singular CIO at Goldman Sachs. For Marty Chavez, the decision to return to Goldman Sachs came after a week cleaning toilets. Chavez, 49, is the firm's CIO, but that doesn't begin to tell his story. He's part tech pooh-bah, part guru, and the newest member of Goldman's 29-member executive committee. He's also an example of how people can reinvent themselves at Goldman -- and in life. Arriving at Goldman ( GS , Fortune 500 ) in 1993 after earning his Ph.D. in medical information science at Stanford, Chavez worked as a quant in the energy business -- but left four years later, claiming he needed a new challenge. That wasn't the real reason. ""The real reason is I made a big change in my life,"" says Chavez. ""I decided to stop drinking."" Seeking a change of venue (people in recovery call it ""pulling a geographic""), he moved to Credit Suisse, but says he knew he'd made a terrible mistake. After a few years he left the industry, founded and sold a startup, bought a beach house, and retired to Fire Island, N.Y. Soon after that, he got a call from now-president Gary Cohn, then co-head of global securities. ""I heard you sold your company -- congratulations,"" Chavez recalls him saying. ""I heard you retired. That's ridiculous. I was just calling to share with you that you're coming back."" When Chavez told him he was burned out on commodities, Cohn suggested investment banking. Chavez didn't know the first thing about banking, but Cohn was insistent. Chavez was reluctant. But after some soul-searching at a silent monastery in New Mexico, he says he had an epiphany. ""It's the only time in my life that I would say there was a clear message from the universe,"" he says. It might have been that he wanted out of his task for the day -- cleaning toilets -- but Chavez says he realized that he wanted to effect transformation in a global way and that returning to Goldman ( No. 45 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For ) was the way to do it. He returned, made partner a year later, and soon was named global co-chief operating officer of equities. ""After that I became pretty fearless,"" he says. So last year when the firm told him it needed him to become CIO, he was game. Goldman had just suffered a coding glitch that caused it to lose tens of millions on errant trades. Chavez, with his tech background and stature within the firm, was the ideal person. So far, so good, he says. Young people often ask Chavez what it takes to do well. He has an answer he's honed over the years: If Goldman Sachs is your top priority in life, he says, it probably won't work (""That's wonderful, but I don't want to hang out with you,"" he says); but if it's your fourth, that probably won't cut it either. He advises them to make a list of their ""short and sacred list of priorities."" For him, he says, Goldman is a solid three. ""Not one, not two,"" he says. ""And definitely not four.""","Marty Chavez: A singular CIO at Goldman Sachs - Jan. 16, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/16/leadership/best-companies-goldman-chavez.pr.fortune/index.html
350,"MORE ON: LONDON ó French President FranÁois Hollande came under heightened pressure yesterday to secure the backing of lawmakers before taking military action in Syria, with his position significantly complicated by President Barack Obamaís decision to consult Congress ahead of any strike. A vocal critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Hollande has long stood with Britainís Prime Minister David Cameron in calling for tougher action. But after Cameronís stunning defeat in the British Parliament over Syria last week and Obamaís weekend move, Hollande finds himself facing a new set of political risks. Franceís National Assembly is set to debate possible Syria action tomorrow, but lawmakers are not scheduled to vote on a resolution. Under French law, Hollande does not need to call a vote until four months after any intervention has started and has thus far has rejected one prior to any strike. But Hollandeís opponents argue that a decision by the French president not to allow a vote would leave Paris out of step with other world capitals. ìNo matter what happens in Syria, France is not going to become the dominant ally of the United States.î Dominique Moisi, senior adviser at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris. ìItís not going to happen.î ìI think there should be a vote of Parliament,î Arnaud Danjean, a center-right French member of the European Parliament, told the France24 television channel. ìWe see the skepticism of the people, and we see the skepticism of our allies.î The government in Paris is nevertheless pressing for action, with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault meeting with top French lawmakers to disclose domestic intelligence on an alleged Aug. 21 chemical attack by the Assad regime. The evidence, according to a nine-page summary posted on the French government website, described the ìmassive use of chemical agentsî believed to be deployable only by Assad or the ìmost influential members of his clan.î A French review of video footage counted at least 281 dead, but French experts also concluded that other estimates as high as 1,500 were consistent with the likely number of fatalities from such an attack. Hollandeís opponents argue that Cameron, too, had the power to act without Parliament but chose to consult with lawmakers given the complexity of the Syrian conflict. But French analysts say Hollande faces a difficult choice. A decision to act without the backing of lawmakers would raise questions about his mandate, but a vote would carry the risk of the same of surprise political humiliation that saw Cameron lose a call to arms last week. In addition, Hollande would probably have to wait until after Congress decides, less he leave Paris in the embarrassing position of having to back away from military action if Capitol Hill rejects it. ìThis act cannot be left without a response,î Ayrault told reporters in Paris late Monday. But, he added ìit is not for France to act alone. The president is continuing his work of persuasion to bring together a coalition without delay.î In the wake of Britainís decision to opt out of any strike, analysts said French participation in any American-led strike in Syria would be crucial to U.S. hopes of establishing international credibility for action. On Monday, NATOís Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was convinced that the Syrian regime was behind the alleged Aug. 21 attack and called for strong action. But he made clear that he did not foresee a broader NATO role and said that it would be up to individual member nations to decide how to respond. At the same time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stepped up the pressure against Washington. Responding to U.S. claims it presented Russia with irrefutable evidence of regime culpability, Lavrov said, ìThere are no facts there.î ìWhen we ask for more detailed proof, they say, ëYou know, itís all secret, so we cannot show it,î he said according to the Reuters news agency. ìThat means there are no such facts.î If Hollande does join a U.S.-led coalition, it would raise the prospect that the very nation savaged in Washington for rejecting the 2003 Iraq invasion could emerge as the leading European partner in any Syria strike. Yet even if the French participate and the British ó traditionally the staunchest U.S. ally in Europe ó sit this one out, few analysts see a long-term shift in which Paris replaces London as the go-to ally for Washington. Rather, France has a number of rationales for acting in Syria that might not carry into the future. For one, France is the former colonial power there and sees Damascus as being within its sphere of influence. For years, Paris has also smarted at Assadís involvement inside another former French colony, Lebanon. ìThis is payback time for France,î said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. ìThe Assad regime has given them a hard time.î In addition, by sitting out the war in Iraq, French politicians lack the same baggage as those in Britain, whose troops entered the U.S.-led mission in Iraq based on false intelligence. It has made any decision to join in on Syria easier for the Elysee Paris than No. 10 Downing Street. Without question, France has recently be flexing its military might, helping lead the allied operation in Libya two years ago and taking unilateral action this year in Mali. Yet, France has long judged its foreign-policy objectives to be somewhat separate and distinct from purely ìAnglo Americanî goals. That makes it unlikely Paris would easily fill any void left by the British should their decision last week signal a future unwillingness to cooperate in coalition operations.",Hollande under pressure to put Syria action to vote | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/09/03/hollande-under-pressure-to-put-syria-action-to-vote/

Over the last several weeks I conducted an informal survey ó i.e., I mostly was dressed in jeans, sneakers and a golf shirt ó of male friends and family and their friends and family, to determine the extent of their social embarrassment and physical unease as per the wearing of stitched-label undergarments. What I learned was stunning: No one ever had such a problem. In fact, some seemed far more annoyed by my questions than the worst annoyance that a pair of stitch-labeled briefs could cause. And then the final questions: By creating both this disease and cure for a problem from which none ever suffered, was Hanes pulling our legs, giving us all a wedgie? Isnít Hanes simply saving factory production costs by stamping labels on undergarments rather than having them sewn on?

353,"Car gadgets raise privacy fears. Ford's SYNC is one of the devices that's gathering information about drivers. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Consumers want their cars to be more connected. But smarter vehicles are raising concerns about protecting driver privacy. New cars carry computers and wireless communication packages that track everything from where the car is driven to what speed it travels. While drivers want turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates, they wouldn't want data about their trip to result in a speeding ticket showing up in the mail. So there are calls from both inside and outside the industry for new laws to protect that driving data. ""It's just really important that we have boundaries and guidelines to operate,"" said Ford CEO Alan Mulally in remarks at this week's Detroit auto show. ""Our homes, the cars, everything is going to be on the Internet. Everything's going to be connected. And so what are the guidelines? What do we want?"" Mulally said Ford is cooperating with regulators that are considering what privacy protections are needed for the driving data. His comments followed those earlier this month from another Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) executive who suggested the automaker had collected data showing if vehicle owners were speeding or breaking other traffic laws. ""We know everyone who breaks the law; we know when you're doing it.,"" said Jim Farley, executive vice president of global marketing at Ford at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He and the company eventually backed away from the statement, saying Ford does not have data showing driving activity. Ford's onboard communication system, SYNC, is a joint venture with software provider Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) . Mulally announced last week he would be staying at Ford and would not be leaving the company to become the Microsoft CEO. Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) says the information collected onboard cars belongs to the driver and is only used with their permission. Other automakers also said they respect privacy of the data they're collecting. ""We've worried about this issue for a long period of time, about the utilization of that database,"" said Sergio Marchionne, the CEO of Chrysler Group and Fiat. But there are advantages for the drivers to the automaker collecting data about their driving habits. The data, in aggregate, can help the automakers when designing the next generation of cars. ""If I could read the performance of all our vehicles at all times on the road, I could come up with a set of corrective actions that would make the manufacture and the software of these cars a lot more efficient,"" Marchionne said. The issue of driver privacy protection was receiving attention even before the comments from the Ford executives, as vehicles become more connected through wireless communications. The General Accountability Office, Congress' watchdog group, issued a report last month that showed auto manufacturers, portable navigation device makers and developers of mapping and navigation applications for mobile phones now collect data in order to provide customers with services. But it also found that the 10 companies studied do not follow all industry-recommended privacy practices. It also said it is difficult for consumers to understand the privacy risks inherent in using these services. Watch a driverless Audi hit the highway. Sen. Al Franken, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, said last week that the GAO report shows there needs to be more protection of driver privacy. ""Privacy laws haven't kept pace with these enormous advances,"" said Franken. ""People across the country need much more information about how the data are being collected, what they're being used for, and how they're being shared with third parties."" The Minnesota Democrat said he intends to reintroduce legislation to offer more legal protection.","Driver privacy protections rising issue for Detroit, Washington - Jan. 15, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/15/technology/driver-privacy/index.html

In a unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the Federal Communications Commission overstepped its bounds when it implemented a series of rules in 2010 forbidding broadband providers from blocking content or giving preferential treatment to one content provider over another.

356,"67-year-old Italian restaurant closes its doors. On New Year's Eve, Mike and Cathie Merlino will close Merlino's Belvedere after 67 years in business. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Six months after a 3,000-acre wildfire raged through Royal Gorge and decimated the economy of Canon City, Colo., Mike Merlino had no choice but to close his family's namesake restaurant. So after nearly 70 years, Merlino's Belvedere will serve dinner for the last time on New Year's Eve. Merlino announced the restaurant's closing on Dec. 2, which, ironically, led to a huge surge in business. Since then, the restaurant has produced over 400 gallons of its red sauce and over 700 pounds of sausage -- three times the normal amount. But even with the bump, this year's gross revenue of $750,000 is still about 25% lower than in 2012, Merlino said. (In 2005, it was even higher at $1.3 million.) His restaurant is a well-known destination for tourists and diners all along Colorado's Front Range, who drive hours for its award-winning homemade red sauce, pasta and steaks cured on site. It's also a favorite gathering spot for locals in this small town of 17,000. But it's been a daily battle to stay open for the last two years, in the wake of a series of natural disasters and a struggling economy. ""In 2008-2009, there were rising gas prices on top of a weak economy,"" said Mike Bandera, president of the Canon City Chamber of Commerce. ""We had a significant downturn in tourist traffic in the rafting businesses, and in restaurants and shops."" Sam Cruz, the restaurant's longtime kitchen manager, grill cook and handyman, has seen that reflected at Merlino's. ""In the late '80s, we had people waiting in line to get in every night,"" he said. ""We were doing probably 150 to 200 dinners a night."" But until Merlino announced the closing, Cruz said the restaurant was doing just 20 to 30 dinners a night. The economy of Canon City and surrounding Fremont County is built on tourism and the prison industry -- the county is home to 13 prisons, including the so-called Supermax. The county is one of the state's poorest, with a per capita income of around $17,400 and an unemployment rate of 8.7%, nearly 2% higher than Colorado as a whole. The economic downturn is obvious in Canon City's largely shuttered Main St., which dead-ends into the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, the oldest operational prison in the state. Jobs are hard to come by, and many that do exist are plagued by static wages, says Merlino, a former president of the town's Chamber of Commerce. ""When you lose a lot of the local businesses like we have, people start migrating to Wal-Mart. It's a pretty dismal picture,"" he said. At a time when chains like Chili's, Applebee's and the Olive Garden -- which all have locations within 40 miles -- have multiplied across the country, family-owned restaurants like Merlino's have either closed or barely managed to hold on. ""This is emblematic of what happens to a lot of family businesses, not just restaurants,"" said Giovanni Coratolo, vice-president of small business policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""If you're already in a recession, if a natural disaster or other unforeseen event happens, all of a sudden, you can't recover."" The Royal Gorge fire burned 3,220 acres over six days, including most of the Royal Gorge Park, and brought tourism to a halt. Bandera estimated that local businesses lost 25% to 35% of their expected yearly revenue. Merlino's, which saw a 40% drop in volume this past summer, was just one of the casualties. Built in 1946 by his grandfather Ubaldo ""Baldy"" Merlino, a miner who emigrated in 1903 from Italy, the restaurant takes its name from Mount Belvedere in Italy, where Merlino's business partner and brother-in-law fought in WWII. ""We have customers who have literally grown up with us,"" said Cathie Merlino, who manages the restaurant with her husband and acts as hostess. ""Every birthday, graduation, marriage, they come here. Whoever it is, they become part of our family."" Over the years, the restaurant has also served a number of famous faces, including John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Nat King Cole and Jane Fonda when they were on location nearby. The restaurant has been totally booked since Merlino made his announcement. Long-time customers are even flying in from out of state for one last meal. On a recent night, the 21 employees scrambled to keep up with the huge surge. ""On the morning after we announced we were closing, we had 89 voicemail messages requesting reservations,"" Merlino said.","67-year-old Italian restaurant closes its doors - Dec. 31, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/31/smallbusiness/merlinos-belvedere/index.html

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Apple will refund millions of dollars to consumers after allowing kids to make purchases in apps without their parents' consent. Apple will pay at least $32.5 million, after reaching a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission Wednesday. FTC Commissioner Edith Ramirez said that Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) failed to notify parents that once they enter their Apple passwords for children to buy virtual items for games on their iPhones and iPads, they leave open a 15-minute window during which children can make additional and unlimited in-app purchases without additional parental authorization. These charges generally range from 99 cents to $99.99 per in-app charge.

One consumer complained to the FTC that her daughter had spent $2,600 in the app Tap Pet Hotel, according to Ramirez. Others reported that their kids had racked up as much as $500 in in-app purchases. Apple has agreed to provide full refunds to consumers who have been affected, Ramirez said. Apple has emailed consumers who may have been impacted by unauthorized charges, but Ramirez said consumers can also reach out to Apple if they believe they have been affected.

""This settlement is a victory for consumers harmed by Apple's unfair billing, and a signal to the business community: whether you're doing business in the mobile arena or the mall down the street, fundamental consumer protections apply,"" Ramirez said in a statement.

""Today's agreement with the FTC extends our existing refund program for in-app purchases which may have been made without a parent's permission,"" the company said in a statement.

358,"MORE FROM. Boutique financial firms inked deals for 80 offices last year at $100 per square foot or more in 27 different buildings, up from 2012, when there were just 51 such deals, a new Jones Lang LaSalle report shows. According to broker Cynthia Wasserberger, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle, this puts the city back on par with the 81 such deals in 2007 and foreshadows a banner year similar to 2008, when 91 leases were signed at over $100 per foot. While these leases amounted to a tiny slice of the market ó 1 million square feet of the total 23 million feet leased last year ó Wasserberger says, ìThese trophy leases are market indicators of the health of the boutique financial-services industry that includes hedge funds and private-equity firms, and indicates growing confidence in their businesses going forward.î The desire for high-floor trophy offices has also created a sky-high space crunch, with a vacancy rate of just 5 percent for offices above the 25th floor ó a big recovery from 2002, when many companies were height-averse after 9/11. The largest deals over $100 per square foot in 2013 included 112,585 square feet for the Jeffries Groupís future expansion at 520 Madison Ave., a renewal and expansion by Och-Ziff Capital Management Group at 9 W. 57th St. to 95,200 square feet, and a renewal and expansion by Federated Investors at 101 Park Ave. for 52,800 square feet. ìThey wanted to remain in place and paid strong rents,î said Wasserberger, who declined to reveal the tenant names (but we obtained them through CoStar and other industry data). Nine W. 57th St. has the top honors for both 2013 and 2008, at the peak of the market, with a rent of $205 per foot. In 2012, its highest rent was $185 a foot. With a dozen renewals and new leases, Aby Rosenís RFR Holdings walked away with the most deals of more than $100 a square foot for its Seagram Building, as it did in 2010 to 2012. The company also chalked up 15 such deals across its portfolio, with Boston Properties signing 14 leases and Paramount Group 11. One blemish on the numbers is that free rent and Tenant Improvement allowances (known as TI) are much higher today than in 2008. Tenants received an average of 3.8 months of free rent in í08, versus 6.7 months last year, while the average TI was $30.49 per square foot in 2008 and $61.13 per square foot in 2013. ìSo while the starting and face rents are back, the net effective rents are well off peak levels,î Wasserberger said. Thatís one reason Cushman & Wakefieldís 2013 report released Tuesday only counted 60 such deals. But while economist Ken McCarthy predicted $100 rents would be reached in 2014 in a market other than Midtown, Wasserberger believes triple digits in the tech-favored Midtown South buildings ìwill be a hurdle.î A stalled downtown site at 45 Broad St. between Exchange and Beaver streets where Robert De Niro once planned a hotel could be sold and finally developed as a tall, 264,200 square-foot tower with views to the Statue of Liberty. ìThere is no height restriction in the area,î said Nat Rockett of Cushman & Wakefield, who is marketing the site along with colleagues Helen Hwang, Jared Kelso, Karen Wiedenmann and Sujohn Sarkar. ìIt truly is an opportunity to create a brand-new and attractive building and redefine the FiDi skyline,î said Rockett. The group expects bidders will focus on residential condominiums and hotels as units are selling for over $2,000 per foot and the hotel market remains underserved. The availability in downtownís Water Street corridor is now getting chipped away, proving the buildings to be stronger than Sandy. In good news for building owner Jack Resnick & Sons, Allied World Insurance Co., which is a subtenant on two floors of 199 Water St., will convert to a direct tenancy and double its space to 143,297 square feet. The subsidiary of the Switzerland-based giant now leases the 24th and 25th floors from Wells Fargo and will add floors 23 and 26 when the sublease ends on Jan. 1, 2015. The asking rent was $48 per foot. Paul Ippolito and Joseph Zona of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank represented the insurance company in the 16-year deal. John Cefaly and Robert Constable of Cushman & Wakefield worked with in-house agents Brett Greenberg and Dennis Brady of Resnick on behalf of the building, also known as One Seaport Plaza. Other tenants are now touring five other floors, totaling 180,000 square feet, which will also come available on Jan. 1. Nearby, Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass signed a 15-year lease for 58,444 square feet encompassing the entire 44th and part of the 45th floors of One New York Plaza. The law firm is now located in the nearby One Battery Park Plaza. According to CompStak, the starting rent is in the low-$40s per foot and concessions included a year of free rent. Mound Cotton is currently located in the neighboring One Battery Park Plaza. The attorneys were represented by Lewis Miller of CBRE while his colleagues Peter Turchin, Kenneth Rapp, Michael Rizzo and Adam Foster represented the Brookfield Properties ownership, along with David Cheikin and Duncan McCuaig. Dallas-based Neiman Marcus is finally lassoing a spot in the city for its off-price LastCall outlet. This is Neimanís first foray into Gotham since the company was sold to a group lead by Ares Management last fall for $6 billion, so thereís pressure to increase revenues at the retailer. LastCall is leasing 16,000 square feet at 210 Joralemon St., a redevelopment of the Brooklyn Municipal Building now owned by Albert Labozí United American Land. ìThis is incredibly huge for Brooklyn,î said Laboz of its first location in the city. The space includes an 800 square-foot entrance with an escalator up to the entire second floor. Sephora is already open, with Itís Sugar and Yoga Works soon to join them in the 48,000 square-foot project. The retailer was represented by Howard Dolch and Robin Abrams of The Lansco Corp.

359,"INDIANAPOLIS ó Carmelo Anthony remembers the feeling last May, walking off the court at Bankers Life Fieldhouse after a Roy Hibbert block, after the Pacers had knocked the Knicks into summer, winning the second-round playoff series in six games. Thursday, the Knicks will make their first visit to Indy since the crushing loss ended the Knicksí title hopes. The Pacers are a league-best 30-7. ìHow can I forget the feeling?î Anthony said. ìI canít explain [the feeling]. Itís unexplainable. I will never forget that feeling. ìIndiana is rolling. Theyíre playing great, might be the best team in the NBA. Itís a tough game on their court, and we have to be prepared for that.î Anthony, who has advanced past the first round just twice in his 10 playoff appearances, has suffered a lot of tough postseason defeats, so he wonít classify it as the lowest moment of his career. But itís close. Anthony was muted in the fourth quarter of all three playoff games in Indy to end an MVP-caliber season in disappointment. He repeatedly said during the 2012-13 season it was the best team he ever had been on. It will also be a bittersweet night for center Tyson Chandler, who is battling back from bronchitis just as he was battling from strep throat last May and lost the low-post battle against Hibbert. ìI was [ticked] off the way we exited,î Chandler said. ìObviously we wanted to go further than that. But we canít accomplish that in the next couple of days. We want to continue to build and start a new winning streak.î Chandler was rusty in his Charlotte return Tuesday, when the Knicksí five-game winning streak was snapped, so he doesnít want to make too big a deal out of Thursdayís showdown. The Knicks have won six of eight games in 2014, showing signs of life, but they still own a 15-23 record. ìRight now itís regular season,î Chandler said. ìWe played well against them throughout regular season [last year], but the playoffs is where it counts. Nobody remembers that. Nobody remember how well we played in regular season last year. They remember the end. ìItís a big game, we need to get a win, but at the end of the day itís still the regular season.î The Knicks nearly beat the Pacers at the Garden in November. They were victims of a tough call against Iman Shumpert in the final seconds of regulation when he grazed Paul George on a 3-pointer, and George was awarded three free throws to tie the score. The Knicks have beaten Miami and nearly beaten Indiana, which gives Woodson hope. He doesnít like the notion that some, including owner James Dolan, who believe Pacers coach Frank Vogel ó who on Tuesday was named the coach of the Eastern All-Stars ó got the better of Woodson last May. In Woodsonís defense, he was forced into playing a feeble Amaríe Stoudemire, who had just returned from March knee surgery. Now Stoudemire is playing electric. ìHeís in a nice groove,î Woodson said. ìIf we stay in the neighborhood of 22, 25 minutes and get all our guys back, I think weíre going to be just fine. Weíll have a legitimate shot [at contending].î",Knicks eager to bury memories of playoff demise in Indy | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/knicks-eager-to-bury-memories-of-playoff-demise-in-indy/
360,"The Rangers and Red Wings havenít directly competed against one another for a playoff spot since 1969-70. Both clubs made it on the final weekend of that season that ended with the bizarre last day on which the Blueshirts hammered Detroit 9-5 at the Garden while pulling goaltender Ed Giacomin with a 9-3 lead in the afternoon, before the Canadiens lost in Chicago 10-2 while pulling goaltender Rogie Vachon once down 5-2 that night. The only other time since World War II came in 1961-62, when the Rangers grabbed the final berth by four points over the Red Wings, keyed by a 3-2 victory over Detroit at the Garden on Mar. 14, 1962 in which Andy Bathgate broke a 2-2 tie by scoring on a penalty shot at 9:03 of the third period against Hank Bassen. So although the clubs share the romantic Original Six heritage, there is little in their shared past ó other than the 1950 Finals in which the Red Wings prevailed in Game 7 double overtime after the Blueshirts had taken a 3-2 lead in the series, in which five games were played in Detroit, including the final four, while two were played in Toronto and none in New York because the circus had commandeered the Garden ó to bind the club as historical rivals. Of course, until this year, the Rangers and Red Wings hadnít been in the same conference since 1992-93. The next year, the Red Wings moved west, where they stayed until this seasonís realignment. Coincidental, isnít it, how Detroit manages to position itself to play in the weaker conference? But if it has been more than four decades since the two clubs were in direct competition for a postseason berth, thatís exactly the circumstance now, with the Rangers one point ahead of Detroit in the battle for an Eastern Conference wild-card position as the Red Wings visit the Garden on Thursday. The Rangers and Maple Leafs held the two wild-card spots, each with 51 points, before Torontoís match at home against the Sabres on Wednesday. The Red Wings have 50 points (tied with the Senators and Devils), with two games in hand on the Blueshirts and three on the Leafs. Detroit had one game in hand on the Senators and two on the Devils. Detroit has won only 20 of 46 games (20-16-10), 17 in regulation, two in overtime and one by shootout in going 1-7 in the skills competition. Of course, the Red Wings ó who havenít won fewer than 43 games in a full season since 1996-97, when they won 38 before capturing their first Stanley Cup since 1955 ó do have excuses for their middling performance, and theyíre either on or have been on injured reserve. Indeed, Pavel Datsyuk, who has missed 11 games this year, will be out Thursday with a lower-body issue. Daniel Alfredsson, who has missed eight games, is questionable with back spasms. Jonathan Ericsson, who has missed 17 matches, is on IR with broken ribs. Johan Franzen, who has missed 16 games, is on IR with a head injury. Stephen Weiss, sidelined for 20 overall, is on IR recovering from sports hernia surgery. Jimmy Howard, who has won only eight of 26 starts (8-10-8), is questionable with a hip flexor. Additionally, Tomas Tatar will not play, as he has been excused to attend his fatherís funeral in Slovakia. At least Henrik Zetterberg, who missed nearly all of December with a herniated disc in his back, is scheduled to play for the Red Wings, who are 13-8-7 within the East and 7-8-3 against the West after getting out while the getting was good. Derek Stepan, who failed to record a shot in Tuesdayís 2-1 defeat to the Lightning, has not scored a goal in 12 games (four assists) since a Dec. 20 power-play goal against the Islanders. Stepan has one goal in his last 14 and two in his last 29. The putative first-line center has seven goals overall including a Nov. 2 hat trick. The Rangers, who did not skate on Wednesday, had seven shot attempts bidding for the tying goal on a power play that started at 15:21 of the third period on Tuesday, but four were blocked and one went wide. The Blueshirts generated five attempts ó with one on goaltender Ben Bishop ó in the first 1:25 of the man-advantage before the Lightning could clear the zone.",Rangers-Red Wings rivalry gets renewed | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/rangers-red-wings-rivalry-gets-renewed/
361,"Playing in the same division as the Blackhawks and in the same conference as the red-hot Ducks has made the Blues less noticeable than those teams, but man, are they having a fine season. Their recent run started during the strike-shortened season of 2013, when the Blues finished 29-17-2, fourth in the Western Conference, and many thought they would be contenders this year. Well, they have been. With a 32-8-5 record, the Blues have the third-most wins in the league and have played all-around great hockey. Their home record is 18-3-2, while theyíre 14-5-3 on the road. They rank in the top five in goals per game (1st), goals against (3rd), power-play percentage (3rd) and penalty kill percentage (5th) and have a league-best plus-63 goal differential. The next closest teams ñ Chicago and Anaheim ó are plus-42. And the Blues have been playing the past month without top goal scorer Alex Steen, who suffered a concussion. Other players ñ such as David Backes, Jaden Schwartz and T.J. Oshie ñ have stepped up, a big reason why St. Louis has been held pointless in back-to-back games only once. Now theyíre hoping to avoid a repeat of last seasonís first-round playoff exit. (Last weekís rankings in parentheses) 1. Ducks (1): The Ducks are 7-0-0 in 2014 and have 17 wins in 18 games. Goalie Jonas Hiller has won 14 straight starts. 2. Blues (3): St. Louis is two points behind the Blackhawks for the Central Division lead Ö with four games in hand. 3. Penguins (2): With a 16-point lead over the next closest team in the Atlantic Division, itís only a matter of time before they have a magic number. 4. Blackhawks (4): Chicago has played 15 overtime games this season, but has yet to score an overtime goal, and dropped to 0-5 in overtime with a 3-2 loss to the Avalanche on Tuesday. They are 4-6 in shootouts. 5. Avalanche (9): After big road wins against the Wild and Blackhawks, looking for their first three-game winning streak in two months on Thursday against the Devils. 6. Lightning (7): Two goals in a nine-second span early in the second period was enough for the Lightning to take down the Rangers, 2-1, on Tuesday. 7. Sharks (5): Have alternated wins and losses over the past nine games, but all the losses have been in regulation, and those missed points could be important down the stretch. 8. Bruins (6): Boston has lost three of four games, as Tuukka Rask appears to be slumping, having allowed 12 goals in four games. 9. Kings (8): Donít blame it on the goalies ó the Kings allow a league-low 2.0 goals per game ó but Los Angeles has won just three times in 10 games. 10. Canadiens (10): With a mediocre 6-4-2 record against Atlantic Division foes, the Canadiens need to improve that mark if they hope to win the division. 11. Flyers (13): Responded to two clunkers in weekend†losses to the Lightning and Rangers with a 4-3 win against the Sabres on Tuesday, scoring the game-winning goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. 12. Canucks (11): Vancouver is 4-4-3 in its past 11, but its top-ranked penalty kill (89.7 percent) has excelled, allowing three goals in 11 games (28-for-31). 13. Rangers (17): Were a season-high four games over .500 before a 2-1 loss to the Lightning on Tuesday, but still own a 6-2-1 mark in their past nine games. 14. Wild (12): Zach Parise may start skating this week, and thatís good news for the goal-starved Wild. 15. Capitals (15): Crazy stat of the day: After his shootout miss in Tuesdayís 2-1 loss to the Sharks, Alex Ovechkin has now missed 11 of his past 12 shootout attempts. 16. Senators (20): A current 6-0-1 stretch has been nice, but now comes the tough part: games against the Canadiens, Rangers, Capitals and Lightning in the next week. 17. Stars (14): It only took seven games, but Dallas finally has a win in 2014 after a 5-2 victory over Edmonton on Tuesday. 18. Maple Leafs (18): The Leafs have three regulation wins in their past 27 games. Thatís not very good. 19. Devils (22): It couldíve been Martin Brodeurís final game in his hometown of†Montreal on Tuesday. If so, he went out in style with 29 saves in a 4-1 victory to earn career win No. 682 ñ 45 of which have come against the Canadiens. 20. Red Wings (19): Lots of reasons to be concerned in Detroit, and hereís one: The power play is 0-for-21 in five games. 21. Coyotes (16): Three wins in 15 games has pushed them out of a playoff spot, but somehow, in the tough Western Conference, theyíre still within four points of a playoff spot. 22. Islanders (23): All good things must come to an end, as did the Islandersí seven-game road winning streak with a 4-2 loss to the Panthers on Tuesday. But they have slowly climbed back into playoff contention with seven wins in nine games. 23. Blue Jackets (26): In three starts since returning from injury, Sergei Bobrovsky has three wins, including a shutout, and a .953 save percentage to get Columbus back on track. 24. Hurricanes (21): Had been playing well, but back-to-back shutout losses against the Blue Jackets and Flames is cause for concern. 25. Predators (24): Rookie defenseman Seth Jones has one goal in 26 games, and the Predators continue to struggle on offense, ranking 26th in the league with 2.3 goals per game. 26. Panthers (27): At one point, Florida was 4-12-4, but they have gone 14-9-3 since in large part due to Tim Thomas, who has given the Panthers something they havenít had in years: solid goaltending. 27. Jets (25): After five consecutive defeats, the Jets fired coach Claude Noel this weekend and replaced him with Paul Maurice. His debut Monday was a success: a dominant 5-1 win against the Coyotes. 28. Sabres (29): Buffalo was seconds away from earning a point in four straight games for the first time this season. Not so fast. The Sabres allowed a late regulation goal in a 4-3 loss to the Flyers on Tuesday to dash those hopes. 29. Flames (28): The Flames lost to the Predators, 4-2, on Tuesday but hey, at least they scored two goals! 30. Oilers (30): Not going to win many games when youíre outshot, as Edmonton has been in seven of its past eight games (two wins, six losses).",NHL power rankings: Blues totally in rhythm | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/nhl-power-rankings-blues-totally-in-rhythm/

LONDON (CNNMoney) Love it or hate it, Bitcoin is here to stay. Tech gurus, executives and investors lined up at the 'Le Web' conference in Paris Tuesday to predict a bright future for Bitcoin , challenging critics who have emphasized the risks associated with the digital currency. ""I think there is a lot more that is going to happen in the world of money very quickly, and that's because of Bitcoin,"" said Fred Wilson, a tech investor known for his early bets on Twitter ( TWTR ) and Kickstarter . ""We will now see payments and money flow on the Internet in the same way that content flows on the Internet and in the same way that images flow on the Internet,"" he said, adding that this was one of the most ""investable"" trends he could see. PayPal President David Marcus also hopped on the Bitcoin bandwagon, revealing that he owns bitcoins himself and saying he could imagine people using them on the eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) platform in future. However, Bitcoin's volatility would have to come down before it would be more widely adopted as a unit of exchange. ""It's not a [real] currency and it won't be a currency until volatility slows down,"" he said. The value of a bitcoin has soared this year -- from roughly $13 in January to well over $1,200 -- on hopes that the experiment in digital money will eventually become a legitimate global currency. It was trading at $947 on the Mt.Gox exchange Tuesday. Ron Paul: Bitcoin could help end dollar. Bitcoin has received a measure of support from officials at the Federal Reserve, including chairman Ben Bernanke, who said the currency ""may hold long-term promise"" as part of the international payment system. There are already plenty of legitimate uses for bitcoins. But it's also being used to anonymously buy drugs, hire assassins, trade child porn and dodge taxes -- and that has drawn the attention of U.S. lawmakers. Advocates of the unregulated currency have plenty of convincing to do elsewhere, too. China's central bank issued new rules last week that prohibit financial institutions from dealing in bitcoins. While the central bank did not outlaw or prohibit individuals from owning Bitcoin, the guidelines specify that it is not to be considered a currency.","Don't fight it.

363,"MORE ON: It was all in the name of development that the Islanders sent Ryan Strome back to AHL Bridgeport on Wednesday, the No. 5 overall pick from 2011 packing his bag in Tampa and ending his first 15-game stint in the big leagues. In the midst of a six-game road trip for the Islanders that resumes Thursday night against the Lightning and wraps up Saturday night in Philadelphia at the start of a home-and-home with the Flyers, Strome was nearing his limit of games that would have prevented him from playing in the AHL over the two-week Olympic break. Any player that participates in more than 15 of the teamís 20 games leading into the break, which begins Feb. 9, would not be eligible to play for their respective minor-league outlet during the NHLís downtime, the league told teams in a memo before the season. Since being called up in mid-December, the 20-year-old Strome has played in 15 games total, notching a goal and three assists, and a team source said they are not displeased with his performance, nor do they think he has regressed. Only the past eight games have counted towards that restrictive limit as part of the Islandersí 20 leading into the break, which means he does have seven more NHL games to play before then, if the team chooses to utilize them. (Weíre looking at you, Yankee Stadium game versus the Rangers on Jan. 29.)

364,"Sixteen games into a season that began with NCAA Tournament buzz, the Red Storm are a middling 9-7 and an even more disappointing 0-4 in the Big East. ìI think theyíre an NIT team,î CBS Sports college basketball analyst Doug Gottlieb told The Post. ìWe overrated them or Steve [Lavin] hasnít done a good enough job, or we undervalued the importance of having more experience at the point-guard spot. ìItís been a disappointment. I picked them to win the league, and thereís no shot they win the league.î Gottlieb said a variety of issues have hurt the Johnnies, from the slower-than-expected development of highly rated freshman point guard Rysheed Jordan, to the new groupís inability to mesh quickly, to a difficult schedule that has included three of the top six teams in the country: No. 2 Syracuse, No. 4 Wisconsin and No. 6 Villanova. Jordanís play has picked up of late, and he had 16 points, six rebounds and four assists in a loss to DePaul on Tuesday, but also six turnovers. St. Johnís has faltered down the stretch in three of its losses, including the setback to DePaul, when the Johnnies managed just one point over the final 4:35, coughing up a four-point lead. ìI donít think you have a great decision-maker,î ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg said. ìA guy who will facilitate and make a play when the opportunity presents itself, that has the trust of his teammates.î Lavin has raved about his teamís depth from the outset, often using as many as 11 different players and eight different starting lineups. But that may not be a positive, CBS Sports Network analyst Steve Lappas said. ìFor me, personally, Iíve never been a fan of playing that many guys,î Lappas, the former Villanova and Manhattan coach, said. During the preseason a number of experts said St. Johnís had arguably the most talent in the Big East. The Storm had the most players of any team in the Big East honored during the preseason (four), but that has come into question also. ìWhatís talent? Is talent athleticism or is talent basketball skill?î Gottlieb said. ìAthletically, they look very, very good when they go through layup lines, but how many of their guys can really, really play?î Gottlieb asked. ìWe rated their athleticism, not their basketball acumen.î All hope is not lost. On Thursday, St. Johnís begins a three-game homestand at Carnesecca Arena, where it is a perfect 6-0, against shorthanded Providence, and three of the Johnniesí four Big East games have come on the road.

But to get to 20 wins by the time of the Big East Tournament, St. Johnís would have to go 11-4 the rest of the way, and the schedule includes road games against ranked teams Villanova and Creighton, and a trip to Milwaukee to face Marquette. ìI thought they were a team at this point that would be knocking on the door of the tournament as opposed to now they have their work cut out for them,î Lappas said. ìThereís no question theyíre behind the eight ball.î",Why St. Johnís is off to brutal Big East start | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/why-st-johns-is-off-to-brutal-big-east-start/
365,"Most complained-about credit card companies. Capital One and GE Capital were among the issuers that received the most complaints from consumers. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Thousands of Americans are lodging complaints with the government's financial watchdog about their credit cards, and some issuers are being griped about a lot more than others. Of the more than 25,000 credit card complaints the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has processed between the November 2011 launch of its complaint database and last September, Capital One received the biggest share, according to new analysis from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Roughly 21% of all complaints were made about Capital One ( COF , Fortune 500 ) , followed by 18% about Citibank ( C , Fortune 500 ) , 13% for Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and 13% about Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) . Capital One said that it no longer has the highest number of complaints, based on more recent data from the CFPB's complaint database, and that it remains ""committed to working with our customers to resolve any issues they may have."" Based on the ratio of complaints to card purchase volume, however, GE Capital Retail garnered the highest number of grievances through September -- with 88 complaints for every $1 billion in purchase volume. Some of these complaints sparked the CFPB to take legal action last month, ordering GE Capital's medical credit card business to repay $34.1 million to more than one million customers for misleading them into thinking they were signing up for an interest-free line of credit. GE Capital said it disputes this finding, calling the data used ""incorrect,"" according to spokeswoman Dori Abel. The card issuer believes a more appropriate ratio to look at is the number of complaints versus the number of accounts, and said it received only two complaints for every 1 million accounts using that measure. GE Capital spokeswoman Dori Abel said the PIRG findings were based on ""incorrect data,"" and that its purchase volume is more than three times the amount PIRG used. That resulted in a ""material difference in the calculations,"" Abel said. The actual number should be closer to 17 or 18 complaints per $1 billion in transactions, not 88 as PIRG found, she said. GE Capital takes other ratios into account when measuring complaints, including the number of complaints versus the number of accounts, and said it received only two complaints for every 1 million accounts using that measure. Behind your stolen credit card. Capital One received 46 complaints per every $1 billion in purchase volume, ranking second after GE Capital. Like GE Capital, Capital One was also charged with deceptive marketing tactics and forced to refund customers $140 million and pay a $25 million penalty in 2012. The most common complaints among all cardholders were about billing disputes and issues with their interest rates. Other consumers complained about identity theft, fraud or embezzlement or said they had trouble closing accounts, had been hit with inappropriate late fees or had experienced debt collection problems.

366,"Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins, Julius Randle. Aaron Gordon. They would dominate the sport. Only, it hasnít worked out that way. Instead, the best player in the country ó the front-runner at this moment for National Player of the Year honors ó is Creightonís Doug McDermott, who has led Creighton to a perfect 4-0 start in the Big East and is averaging 24.3 points per game, second-best in the country. The senior torched Xavier on Sunday, dropping in 35 points despite a sprained a left shoulder, in just the latest impressive performance from the star forward who will be making millions at this time next year. 1. Arizona (1): Defense still wins at this level, despite the new offense-friendly rules. Arizona is proof of that. The best team in the country is 116th in the nation in scoring, averaging 75 points per game, but is allowing only 56 a night ó fifth-best in the nation ó holding opponents to 37 percent field-goal shooting and 28 percent from 3-point range. 2. Syracuse (2): The ACC has fallen well short of the lofty preseason expectations as the countryís best conference, but Syracuse has held up its end of the bargain. One of four undefeated teams left in the nation ó Arizona, Wisconsin and Wichita State are the others ó the Orange are well on their way to earning the top seed in the East Region of the NCAA tournament, which would likely mean a trip to Madison Square Garden, their home away from home, in late March. 3. Wisconsin (4): Is it too soon to call this Bo Ryanís best team in 13 years at Wisconsin? The Badgers certainly looked the part this week, knocking off Iowa and hammering a good Illinois team to improve to a program-best 16-0. This team can win in a variety of ways, via defensive struggles or offensive shootouts, and looks very much like a Final Four contender. 4. Florida (5): Nobody in the country has dealt with adversity better than the Gators. Injuries, suspensions, absences of key players ó Florida has seen it all up to this point, and it has thrived nevertheless. The latest issue is leading scorer Casey Prather dealing with a bruised right knee. He missed Saturdayís victory over Arkansas and coach Billy Donovan has ruled the senior wing out of Tuesdayís matchup with Georgia. In Pratherís stead on Saturday, Dorian Finney-Smith stepped into the starting lineup, and produced 22 points and 15 rebounds, the latest example of this teamís ability to shake off misfortune. 5. Wichita State (6): The Shockers faced their first true challenge Saturday night, and they handled the stern test like it was routine. Down 19 to Missouri Valley Conference foe Missouri State on the road, Wichita State staged a relentless rally, and behind 22 points and 14 rebounds from Middleton, N.Y. product Cleanthony Early and late-game heroics from Fred VanVleet, prevailed in overtime, extending the best start in program history to 16-0. 6. Michigan State (7): The Spartans have yet to click, but they are tied atop the Big 10 ó unequivocally the best conference in the country ó and are 15-1 despite a brutal schedule. Imagine what happens when Tom Izzoís team really finds itself? 7. Villanova (9): The Wildcats didnít blow us away Saturday afternoon against St. Johnís at the Garden, but they won and did so going away, turning up the defensive pressure and executing on offense down the stretch. Basically, Villanova did what it has done all season ó prevail without much flash. 8. San Diego State (10): Xavier Thamesí leap, from role player to star, is a major part of San Diego Stateís brilliant start after it lost leading scorers Jamaal Franklin (NBA) and Chase Tapley (graduation). The Aztecs have only lost once, at top-ranked Arizona, and are the class of the Mountain West by a wide margin. 9. Oklahoma State (12): There figures to be an NBA scout summit Saturday afternoon when Oklahoma State visits Allen Fieldhouse, and likely top-five picks Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid and Marcus Smart take center stage. Remember: Smart said Wiggins needed to prove he is worthy of all the hype he received in the preseason, which only adds spice to the first of two showdowns between the two Big 12 contenders and future lottery picks. 10. Kentucky (14): The Wildcats are still waiting to hit their stride, but in the meantime, this four-game winning streak will do. One area John Calipari has to be happy with: rebounding. Kentucky, led by Julius Randle and Willie Cauley-Stein, is fifth in the nation in that category, averaging 43.9 boards per game. 11. Creighton (20): A week from Monday, in Philadelphia, will be a must-watch for all Big East fans, and college basketball enthusiasts in general. Creighton visits Villanova in what will likely be an early first-place showdown, a matchup featuring ranked opponents and an opportunity for the Bluejays to land some much-deserved national attention. 12. Kansas (21): Bill Selfís young team showed a lot of maturity over the last week. It responded to its loss to San Diego State like a veteran club. The Jayhawks found a way to win at Oklahoma and followed that impressive effort by dominating in-state rival Kansas State. The performances bode well for Kansas, which continues a daunting stretch against Iowa State, Oklahoma State and Baylor over the next week. 13. Iowa (22): The fourth time proved to be the charm. Following heartbreaking losses to powers Villanova, Iowa State and Wisconsin, Iowa finally sealed a signature victory, notching an impressive 10-point win over Ohio State in Columbus. Fran McCaffery, the former Siena coach who led the Saints to three straight NCAA tournaments berths, has done a fine job turning this program around, just three years removed from an 11-win campaign. 14. Cincinnati (23): Quietly and without much attention, Mick Croninís kids have leaped to the top of the AAC, playing the kind of physical, defensive-mind basketball his program has been known for. Cincinnati could enter the Jan. 30 showdown at Louisville riding a 12-game win streak considering the soft schedule on the horizon. 15. Memphis (18): Weíve seen it all year from Memphis, one loss leading to a winning streak, so it wouldnít come as a surprise to see the Tigers rebound from their loss to Cincinnati with impressive victories over Louisville and Temple. 16. Ohio State (3) 17. Iowa State (8) 18. Baylor (13) 19. Louisville (15) 20. Massachusetts (NR) 21. Duke (11) 22. Pittsburgh (NR) 23. Oklahoma (NR) 24. St. Louis (NR) 25. Gonzaga (25) Dropped out: Colorado, Oregon, Missouri, Illinois. Stock Watch ó Up. Jim Boeheim. The older he gets, the more we hear about retirement, the better his teams play. Syracuse was supposed to take a step back this year, moving into the ACC, yet here are the Orange at 16-0, looking like a cinch for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and perhaps another Final Four run. And consider this: Syracuse is only going to get better. Boeheim and his staff are recruiting at an extremely high level ó they have a consensus top-20 class for next year and the makings of an even better one the year after ó improving what is already an impressive brand. Boeheim, 69, may want to coach into his late 70s at this rate. Kyle Anderson. The New Jersey product is unlike any player in college basketball, a 6-foot-9 point guard nicknamed ìSlow-Moî because of his lack of foot speed and plodding style. The former St. Anthony of Jersey City star is effective nevertheless. Anderson is putting up huge numbers ó 15.3 points, 9.3 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game ó in leading UCLA to a solid 13-3 start. In a near upset of Arizona last week, against a team full of NBA prospects, Anderson had 16 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and three steals. Heís proven to be one of them. Stock Watch ó Down. Duke. Freshman Jabari Parker is in a rut and Duke has started 1-2 in the ACC for the first time in seven years. The Blue Devilsí struggles may seem surprising, but if you look at their resume, their quality wins arenít all that impressive ó over an up-and-down Michigan team at Cameron Indoor Stadium and an inconsistent UCLA squad at the Garden. Coach Mike Krzyzewski has said from the seasonís outset this team has a long way to go, and his words are being proven right. Colorado. Sunday morning, the Buffaloes looked like a serious Pac-12 contender, capable of pushing Arizona. Then the Washington game happened. Colorado lost, but far more upsetting, star guard Spencer Dinwiddie suffered a torn ACL. †The junior, who leads the team in points and assists, makes Colorado go, and with upcoming showdowns against UCLA and Arizona, his absence will loom large.",Postís Top 25: Creightonís McDermott outshining freshmen | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/13/posts-top-25-creightons-mcdermott-outshining-freshmen/
367,"The real low-wage issue: Not enough hours. Naquasia LeGrand makes about $6,000 per year at a KFC in New York City. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Low wages has become the raging issue of the day, sparking protests and discussions nationwide. But dig a little deeper, and workers say another problem is gnawing at their paychecks: not getting enough hours at work. Many fast food and retail employees say it is hard to make anything above poverty-level wages because they don't get scheduled to work enough. Advocates say many employers don't give workers sufficient hours as a way to avoid paying benefits. Take Naquasia LeGrand, who works 15 hours a week at KFC in New York City and has been asking to work more days to no avail. She brings home $120 per week, or $6,000 per year. LeGrand said the maximum number of hours scheduled for any worker at her KFC is 25 per week. It's not that there's less work; she said her manager has hired additional part-time employees when there's need. She used to work more hours at a different KFC, as well, but that location closed down. LeGrand's manager would not comment on her claim. Its fast food corporate parent, Yum Brands ( YUM , Fortune 500 ) , said that most of its stores are franchise-owned, but it pays competitive wages and offers opportunities to help workers build careers. With such few working hours, even a higher wage would likely not make that much of a difference for LeGrand. If the minimum wage was raised to $10.10 per hour, as Senate Democrats have proposed, LeGrand would make an additional $30 more per week, the equivalent of a tank of gas. Experts say that the retail and fast food industries are the most common perpetrators of such low part-time work hours. This way, they can avoid paying out benefits that employees qualify for if they work about 30-plus hours a week. By 2015, Obamacare laws will require employers with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health insurance or face penalties. ""Employers often prefer part-time workers because they don't have to pay benefits and can pay [them] less per hour than full-timers,"" said Arne Kalleberg, a professor of sociology who studies part-time labor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""They can also schedule workers to work at peak times, and not have to schedule them when things aren't busy."" Employers seem to be able to get away with this tactic because of the easy availability of low-wage workers at a time when high joblessness plagues the nation. The share of part-time workers who couldn't find full-time jobs surged during the Great Recession, more than double what it was in the preceding decade. Though their situation has improved recently, more than 7.7 million Americans are still settling for part-time work, compared to about 4.1 million on average in 2006. It has led to the kinds of fast food protests that LeGrand has participated in. Last fall, organizers said the protests spread to 100 cities . Wal-Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) workers have also staged similar actions in the past year. Besides being low-paying, these jobs are also notorious for having inconsistent schedules, which can wreak havoc for workers who are trying to study for a degree or run a household and worry about child care. ""Workers often have no idea how many hours they'll be scheduled for each week, if they'll have to work the day shift or the night shift, if you'll be able to make plans to go to school or take care of your kids,"" said Kendall Fells, organizing director of Fast Food Forward, one group that has organized fast food protests . The situation looks bleak for LeGrand, who shares a phone with her grandmother and can only afford to eat fast food or $1 pizza slices. Sometimes she can't afford to get breakfast. ""I'm just trying to keep my head up and I'm hoping things will get better,"" LeGrand said.","The real low-wage issue: Not enough hours - Jan. 13, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/13/news/economy/minimum-wage-hours/index.html
368,"MORE ON: Microsoft†is rumored to be getting ready to give Windows 8 the boot and release a brand new Windows 9 operating system. The ill-fated software introduced just 15 months ago has suffered from heavy criticism and poor consumer uptake and is reported to be given a complete overhaul for 2015 with Microsoft expected to make the announcement at an event in April. As to what consumers are expected to see with the new operating system is yet unknown but many know the problems faced with Windows 8 and why itís time Microsoft are having a sweeping re-think. When Microsoft gave its radical Windows 8 operating system it presented consumers with a bright, colorful tile style interface which could run seamlessly on desktop, mobile and tablet. However, many traditional features of the system millions had been using for years disappeared, confusing some, alienating others and infuriating many when even the iconic ìstartî button disappeared. An 8.1 update came to rectify many faults and consumer complaints (including bringing back the Start button) with the software but it seems too little too late and Windows is ready to pull the plug on the whole thing. On the mobile scene Windows 8 devices hold a minority market share compared to Android and Appleís iOS devices and despite a good go at releasing numerous handsets and tablets last year the lack of consumer interest and failure to really make an impact in the mobile market has been cause for review for the Microsoft board. Windows 8 has even been unable to make waves in the workplace with many millions of corporations around the globe still using, and preferring to use, Windows 7 running machines. It is a case of identity crisis for the much understood Windows 8, which never managed to bridge the gap between PC and mobile experience. We await more news in the run-up to Microsoftís Build conference in April and perhaps weíll even see a new CEO there, too. Are you a fan of Windows 8? I am not a fan of Windows 8. Microsoft took a very good workplace OS (Windows 7) and thought they could not only add wasteful entertainment elements (the tiles) but make them the basis for a new OS with the ability to do serious work a secondary item. As a result much time is spent in trying to locate such things as ""power options"", inserted CD's or programs on DVD's. Microsoft could have separated the two worlds of business applications and entertainment and given the traditional interface for business with a clickable option for ""tiles"" for entertainment. Microsoft seems to have discounted the need for business applications with the introduction of Windows 8 and I find that disheartening. All microsoft has to do is allow the consumer the option†to boot to†a traditional desktop mode or the new UI when they first install the OS and in control panel†while make both easly accessable. Problem solved.. Why is this so hard? A terrible article. The best thing about PCs, tablets, and phones is that they are upgradable. We are now accustomed to a new OS for iOS, OSX, Android, and Windows every one to two years. Microsoft planning for Windows 9 two years after Windows 8 is the normal course of business and says nothing about Windows 8. Who said Windows 8 was getting the boot, MS said when Windows 8 came out they were going to be on a much more rapid release schedule, and while the version maybe windows 9, I don't expect it to be radically different from what is there now. MS will be giving information about the next version of windows at the Build Conference in just a few months, but the software isn't expected to be out for another year. MS cannot put their OEMs or brand in a situation where they are explaining to customers wait a year and check back. If anything expect Win9 to bring Windows for desktop/laptop, tablet, phone and xbox into a unified platform with a single app store, and similar interfaces. Hope Windows 9 succeeds†like†Windows 7 and XP......††Hope Windows 9 will stop Windows 8.x critics.........? People stop being Windows NT 6.x Critics when Windows 7 came out? will the same apply for Windows 9 when people stop being Microsoft Modern platform Critics? Windows 8.x is better, but people are hoping to calm themselves down with Windows 9.x and give Microsoft another shot...... Windows 8 is easy and fun to use. Lots of great apps. Start screen very pretty. Microsoft's big goof was getting rid of the start button and start menu--which can be remedied in a few minutes by installing a 3rd-party application. All the critics have to do is install a start †menu, boot to desktop and disable active corners; then, for all practical purposes, they are running Windows 7.","Microsoft ëditching Windows 8, planning for 9í | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/microsoft-ditching-windows-8-planning-for-9/
369,"MORE ON: Thinking about quitting your job? A humorous new app aims to relieve the stress and anxiety of confronting the boss with the news by sending a text message instead. Although the new iPhone app is meant to be funny, its creators are hoping it will take off and people will use it to leave jobs. The Quit Your Job app takes users through a series of steps to determine why they are leaving and then crafts a text message that is sent directly to their boss. ìDespite all the advances in technology we still quit our jobs the same way we did hundreds of year ago,î said Alex Douzet, chief executive officer of TheLadders, a New York-based employment company that produces the app. ìThereís a lot of anxiety around the resignation process, so we used technology to ease the pain in that moment and make it seamless to breakup with your boss,î he added. About 2.3 million Americans left their jobs last October, citing reasons such as dissatisfaction with career growth, compensation or simply feeling unrecognized, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Labor. Douzet said the first few months of a new year are the busiest time for job searches. Many people wait for their end-of-year bonuses before making a move to a new position. ìIt always correlates with New Yearís resolutions. People think ëIím not happy and want to make a moveíî he said. Quit Your Job was inspired by another app called BreakupText. Its designers teamed up with the TheLadders to create the new app. BreakupText, which lets users leave their significant others via a text message, costs 99 cents and is available for the iPhone. With Quit Your Job, after sending their resignation users can browse open positions on another app called, Job Search by TheLadders, which targets positions based on the userís job profile and career goals. The free app was launched as an iPhone app in July and released on Android last week. ìThis is unchartered territory,î he said of the Quit Your Job app. ìItís an experiment to see if people will actually use it seriously. If thousands of people download the app and only one ends up using it seriously, thatís interesting because itís changing behaviors,î he said. Douzet added that before leaving a job people should have another one lined up. ìItís more appealing to know youíre in demand. Youíll have more power and leverage since you already have a pay check coming in,î he explained.",Quitting your job?

370,"Jobless benefits are front and center in Washington, as the Senate on Tuesday agreed to start debating a three-month extension to a recession-era law that extended federal jobless insurance to the long-term unemployed. For a million-plus people, the impact of losing a benefit check can be devastating. It means tough choices over making rent, letting bills pile up and putting food on the table. It's probably why the effects will be felt more profoundly by businesses at the local level, especially areas where unemployment remains stubbornly high. Nevada and Rhode Island, for instance, were still battling 9% unemployment in November -- two percentage points higher than the national rate . ""It matters more to regions where unemployment is high and job opportunities are low,"" said Zandi. In California, unemployment insurance kept 680,000 people out of poverty each year, including 200,000 children, according to a report released Monday by the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. And in Texas, benefits kept 226,000 people out of poverty, including 56,000 children. The benefits went into effect in June 2008. It was put in place to help unemployed workers who couldn't find jobs and whose state unemployment insurance had run out. Back then, the jobless rate was 5.6%. It later climbed to more than 10% in 2009, and the government extended or expanded the federal benefits 11 times into the weak recovery, most recently in January 2013. But economists like Zandi say the reason the end of jobless benefits leads to lower unemployment rates is because thousands of workers stop looking for jobs and fall out of the labor market. ""A lot of older workers will retire and drop out of the unemployment rolls,"" Zandi said. ""The rate falls for the wrong reasons."" But another reason why the federal benefits may not be extended is an improving economy. Broad-based hiring in November. Gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic activity -- grew at a 4.1% annual pace in the third quarter, the fastest it's grown in two years, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. And the nation's unemployment rate in November hit a five-year low of 7%. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in December that expiring federal benefits would create a drag on the economy to the tune of 0.2 percentage points and would reduce employment by 200,000 by the end of 2014.","End of jobless benefits hurts people, local economies - Jan. 7, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/07/news/economy/unemployment-insurance-economy/index.html
371,"Questions for ... Cheesecake Factory's David Overton. David Overton says he believes necessity is the mother of all invention. As CEO of the Calabasas Hills, Calif.-based restaurant chain The Cheesecake Factory ( No. 92 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list ), Overton is responsible for more than 33,000 workers serving more than 250 menu items at nearly 200 restaurants, from San Francisco to Dubai. Since opening the first restaurant -- really a bakery in his mother's kitchen -- in 1978, Overton has grown the company into a $1.8 billion business by making changes exactly when his customers and the market demand it. From updating his menu biannually to taking advantage of a growing customer base in the Middle East, Overton is constantly adapting the restaurant's strategy. After 15 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales, he explains why customers keep coming back for everything from ahi carpaccio to cheesecake. Edited excepts: Americans are eating out less and yet you have not responded by offering more low-price deals and discounts. Why? We think that we are high-end casual dining and not really in the same league as Chili's ( EAT ) , Red Lobster ( DRI , Fortune 500 ) , or Olive Garden. Our guests are much better economically. As the stock market goes so do most of The Cheesecake Factory's guests. We just want to get better, give people more of a reason to come back. Rather than discount our way into doing that, we concentrate on the total experience for customers. Dessert is your namesake -- how do you square that with affluent, health conscious customers? We like to think that there is no reason for anyone not to want to come to The Cheesecake Factory ( CAKE ) because our menu is so large. There is nothing Americans want to eat that can't go on our menu. Besides changing our menu twice a year, which we have done for 35 years, we now have more than 60 gluten-free items. We also have a separate menu, which we call our ""SkinnyLicious"" menu, and it has more than 50 items with 590 calories or less. That is very popular for those who are health conscious and I think that 10% of people order off the ""SkinnyLicious"" menu. You spend more than 120 hours training the average full-time hourly employee. Why is all the training time up front worth the investment? Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention. I have really no choice. When you have 250 menu items you must serve they have to be able to recommend to the guests. They have to become tour guides not just servers. You're seeing success with four locations in the Middle East and have plans to create 22 restaurants spread across the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. What is it about the brand that translates well in that region? They are some of the highest grossing restaurants in the whole company because there are so many items for them to order. We have hour waits at those locations. People asked if we were going to cut out portions down for the Middle East, but they eat family style so that is so perfect for The Cheesecake Factory because the portions are so large. The Cheesecake Factory in the Dubai Mall has been open over a year and just had a record-breaking day for the region. Your restaurant chain is not franchised at all in the United States, but you have pursued licensing agreements with other companies in the Middle East and Latin America. Has it been hard to give up that control? We are working so closely with our licensees that I know our concept is being executed to our high standards , so it has not been difficult to give up any control. The Cheesecake restaurant family has expanded in the U.S. to include 11 Grand Lux Cafes. Why create restaurants outside of the well-known Cheesecake Factory brand? As a public company we have to grow. You have no choice but to grow. Rather than build Cheesecake Factories in places that we don't want just for growth's sake, we want to open other brands that help us grow but won't hurt our original brand. For example, the people at Venetian wanted to open a Cheesecake Factory, but it was too close to one of our other locations. Usually we open our restaurants minimally five miles apart, so we created a Grand Lux Cafe for them. Social Questions. Maxwell Strachan: What do you think of Atul Gawande's suggestion that the health care industry should mimic your company in certain ways? His underlying premise of what impressed him the most as a guest in our restaurants is our ability to deliver a consistent guest experience across all of our restaurants throughout the country. Our extensive menu of more than 250 made-from-scratch items and our high volume operations create a very complex operating environment, and Dr. Gawande recognized that it's our consistent use of perfected systems, technology, and the development of our people that enables our guests to have consistently memorable dining experiences -- just as Dr. Gawande is striving to provide consistently excellent health care to patients in hospitals throughout the country. Alex Ocean: Any marketing advice for a startup? I've always felt that word of mouth was the strongest form of advertising -- especially in the early days when we didn't do any form of advertising and social media hadn't come about yet. It's essential to make your product and/or service as great as you possibly can so that people have such a wonderful experience they'll want to tell others about it. Tim Maguire: Did you have a business mentor early on or did you have to figure a lot out in your own? On the financial side of things I learned a lot in the early days from my CPA, Bill Kling, who also became our first CFO. Other than that I really figured out a lot of things on my own -- from the food to our culture and restaurant operations, I relied a lot on my own vision and intuition about what felt right to me. Juhani Polkko: How did your vision grow along the way? At what point he realized this is going to be BIG? I've always believed in the step method -- where you put one foot in front of the other, seeing where you are while looking towards the horizon and moving toward it, trying to get better every day. It wasn't until 1991 when we opened our fifth restaurant, which was our first restaurant outside of California (in Washington, D.C.) and we went public, that I really knew that our company could really grow into something big. Zulmira Almeida: When are you coming to France? I think it will be a long time before we open in Europe, but I hope we'll be there one day. Rhonda McFadden: Why such large portions? Our guests really appreciate our large portions because of the perceived value. Also, our large portions allow guests to share with other people in their party. We've always said that the ""fun is in the food"" and sharing food with others really changes the dynamic of a meal -- adding a lot of fun. Even people who aren't normally inclined to share their meals will often do so at The Cheesecake Factory -- it's all part of the experience. @wes_robertson233: Why does Cheesecake Factory not take reservations? We find that it's more efficient to seat guests in the order that they arrive, which allows us to give more value.","Questions for ...

With a rainbow flag hanging outside of its Wall Street headquarters, investment banking firm Goldman Sachs was quick to express support for Wednesday's Supreme Court decision overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. ""We strongly support the Court's affirmation today of marriage equality,"" the firm tweeted within hours of the ruling. Goldman ( GS , Fortune 500 ) is one of many Wall Street firms to publicly promote workplace inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. It also joined hundreds of companies -- including Starbucks ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ) and Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) -- that had filed a brief with the Supreme Court in opposition to DOMA. ""Today's decisions help define who we are as a people, whether or not we are part of the group directly affected,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said through the company's Twitter account Wednesday. Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) also cheered the court's ruling, noting in a company statement that it promotes a work environment where ""diversity is embraced"" and ""differences are valued and respected,"" while the CEO of credit rating firm Moody's called the ruling ""a significant step forward in ensuring workplace equality."" Meanwhile, Google showed its support through a hidden ""easter egg"" on its site that displayed a rainbow flag around the search box whenever anyone typed the search term ""gay"" or ""marriage equality"" in honor of Gay Pride Month. Fellow tech giants, Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) and Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , released statements in support. ""Today's decision turns the page on a law that made it more difficult for us to treat all of our employees, regardless of sexual orientation, equally,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in a statement. Same-sex couple: 'Freedom is priceless' Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who publicly told off an investor who complained about the company's support for gay marriage, was not available for comment Wednesday. But company spokesperson Danny Cowan said the company, which has offered benefits for domestic partners -- including same-sex partners -- for more than two decades, was pleased by the ruling. ""Equality and inclusion are core values of our company,"" he said. ""We always put our people first and will continue to advocate for equality and inclusion."" Retailers, such as Ben & Jerry's, Gap ( GPS , Fortune 500 ) and Marc by Marc Jacobs, also used social media to show support. Travel site Orbitz ( OWW ) tweeted about a contest to ""celebrate DOMA's defeat"" that offered flights to places that support marriage equality as prizes, while Kenneth Cole announced a giveaway of the company's ""Equalitees"" shirts through its Instagram account in honor of the ""history-making decision."" ""Thrilled about today's #SCOTUS ruling in favor of marriage equality, an issue we've been supporting since 1995,"" the company said on its Facebook page.

373,"MORE ON: Heís the man from the Federal Reserve whose essay in the Wall Street Journal apologized for Fed Chairman Ben Bernankeís hoax on the American publicó quantitative easing ó in order to start a discussion during nominated successor Janet Yellenís confirmation hearings. Andrew Huszar, 40, laid bare the Fedís backdoor bailout of Wall Streetís biggest banks under the guise of helping Main Street. While it is clear that he thinks the people leading the Fed are smart, he thinks they have gone astray. Itís also clear he sees what Main Street sees: lots of risk and very little progress. After QE1, it should have been ì1 and done,î not QE4ever. ìYou have five or six banks controlling 70 percent of US bank assets,î says Huszar, emphasizing how ìtoo big to failî has only gotten worse due to Fed actions. The concentration of assets controlled by Wall Street is one of the greatest concerns for the man who managed the Fedís $1.25 trillion mortgage-backed security purchase program, the first of its kind in the central bankís history. Bernanke and the Fedís actions allowed ìQE to become Wall Streetís new ëtoo big to failí policy,î Huszar says. Huszar feels there is a far too cozy relationship between the Fed chief and Wall Street banks now, which has a dramatic effect on the US economy. The former Morgan Stanley managing director says he doesnít think QE justifies the various costs and risks to the US economy, but adds the markets ìare now dependentî on the Fedís purchases. The Fed should be the lender of last resort ó or ìthe fire station,î as Huszar put it ó not assume the role of underwriter of the US economy. Huszar points directly at Bernanke in his essay and, while he respects both the current chairman and Yellen, he feels the Fedís actions provide cover for the politicians to dig in and not actually address issues. Huszar sees Yellen as an ìenablerî of the same policies. He states that Bernanke made clear that the Fedís central motivation for QE1 was to ìaffect credit conditions for households and businessesî by reducing their interest rates and driving down their costs. Bernanke called this ìcredit easing.î But that never happened, Huszar points out. Credit was not being created ó in fact, it was further constrained by other actions by the central bank and regulatory entanglement. Huszar, who is now a senior fellow at Rutgers Business School, left after the first QE operation ended in 2010. So why did Huszar write the apology? As he posted on his Twitter page: ìBecause I want to try to help get our economy back on track for all Americans.î What did you think of Huszar's confession? we will soon have government underwriting health insurance policies in a bigger way than planned for. †obama often said the new law will not add one dime to the deficit. †in order to keep that promise, could the Fed step in and assume those debts?",Ex-Fed insider confessed hatred of QE | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/11/16/ex-fed-insider-confessed-hatred-of-qe/
374,"When the weather starts to get cold, people always seem to be in a reflective mood ó and an apologetic one. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal carried an incredible confession on its op-ed page written by Andrew Huszar, who was recruited from Wall Street to run the Fedís quantitative-easing program. That program, as my preceding letter to my kids makes clear, is still going strong despite the fact that Hurricane Sandy probably did more to expand demand for goods and services ó and credit jobs ó than QE. Every American should read that piece because it shows just how careless and selfish those with power and money really are. ìI can only say: Iím sorry, America,î Huszar confessed. ìAs a former Fed official, I was responsible for executing the centerpiece program of the Fedís first plunge into the bond-buying experiment known as quantitative easing. ìThe central bank continues to spin QE as a tool for helping Main Street. But Iíve come to recognize the program for what it really is: the greatest back door Wall Street bailout of all time.î Wow! Just what Iíve been saying for years. And here you have it straight from the horseís mouth. Wall Street, banks, politicians ó all of them wanted QE because they couldnít handle the alternative. What was the alternative? That the US would have to live within its means for a few years and ó tough as it is to say ó not behave like the spoiled brat of the globe. QE could only exist if there was a conspiracy of these powerful groups. And I know we like to dismiss any notion of the C-word, but conspiracies do exist. And the economic tricks of the past five years are a prime example. In 2008, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke unveiled the idea of a shadow currency to the world. And as 2014 draws near, weíre still wondering when the US economy will starting growing. My real concern isnít that QE is a failure. The real concern is, How the hell do we kill this monster without hurting millions of people? Bernanke is insisting that the $4 trillion in bonds and mortgages bought through QE will eventually mature and will simply disappear from the Fedís books. Presto, change-o ó all gone. Letís hope. And then there is the problem of the dollar, which has been in a long slump. If foreign investors are holding assets denominated in greenbacks like US Treasury securities, they will take big losses if the dollar continues to slump and they need to return those assets back to their own currency. Optimists think one thing balances all those bad things: the US has the most stable government in the world. So people in places where things arenít so predictable will always want to invest here no matter how much we screw up. Big deal! Thatís an especially meaningless argument if our government canít cut its massive deficit, has lost control over interest rates and is playing chicken with the value of its currency. One good thing has happened since 2008, though. America has become more energy independent, thanks mostly to new technology. Weíve found ways to capture oil that had been beyond our reach and we have technology now that allows cars to go further on a gallon of gas. And that would be awesome news if so much else wasnít going wrong. My suggestion: write your kids a note. Something for them to reflect on when they move to, say, Canada.",Is it possible to kill quantitative-easing painlessly? | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/11/13/is-it-possible-to-kill-quantitative-easing-painlessly/

376,"Online retailer Overstock to accept Bitcoin. Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne is endorsing Bitcoin. His company is the first major U.S. retailer to do so. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Overstock.com will become the first major U.S. retailer to accept Bitcoin, the company's chief executive Patrick Byrne told CNNMoney Friday. Byrne said customers will be able to use the virtual currency to make purchases on Overstock.com ( OSTK ) , which sells everything from digital cameras and bed sheets to patio furniture and even cars. The company is expected to have total revenue of $1.3 billion for 2013, according to FactSet Research. ""We think there's going to be a market in Bitcoin, and we want to get in front of it,"" said Byrne. ""We want to be the first major e-tailer that accepts them."" Byrne first made comments about Overstock.com accepting Bitcoin in an interview with Bitcoin blog newsBTC and later in the Financial Times. Overstock plans to begin accepting Bitcoin near the end of the second quarter of 2014. Byrne said the move stems partly from his background in the Austrian School of economics, which is associated with the Libertarian party in the United States. ""We're the guys who like gold,"" he said. ""We think the monetary base should not be something that a government can create with a stroke of a pen."" Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not backed by any government authority or central bank. It exists only on the internet and is ""mined"" by powerful computers that solve complex math puzzles. Byrne said he is concerned about the possibility of ""bad currency wars"" in the future. He said the U.S. dollar is already being undermined by the Federal Reserve's easy money policies and by overspending by politicians in Washington. Like gold, Byrne said Bitcoin should hold its value better than the dollar because it is ""mathematically constrained"" and cannot be manipulated by government authorities. There are currently 12.1 million bitcoins in circulation, according to blockchain.info. The total number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million. Critics say Bitcoin is at best a fad and at worst a haven for criminals looking to buy and sell illegal goods anonymously. But supporters argue that Bitcoin is a more democratic alternative to traditional currencies. Former U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, an outspoken Libertarian from Texas, has said that Bitcoin could be the dollar's ""destroyer"" if it goes mainstream. Bitcoin has exploded in value this year, rising from about $13 in January to more than $1,200 earlier this month. On Friday, bitcoins were trading at about $739 on the Mt. Gox exchange. The currency is prone to wild swings and experts say Bitcoin will remain volatile as the technology evolves. Byrne acknowledged that the volatility is a problem and that Overstock will need to ""continually convert Bitcoins into dollars"" to avoid losing money. Eventually, he said there will be a derivatives market that will allow companies to hedge their exposure to Bitcoin. In some respects, it's not a surprise that Overstock would move to accept Bitcoin. The company is unconventional. It is known for quirky ads and for shortening its name online to O.co. Byrne also has a penchant for writing long, rambling shareholder letters in earnings reports. And he famously appeared on ""60 Minutes"" to complain about short sellers who were betting against his stock. He even told CNNMoney in 2003 that ""When opportunities come along where we can knee the shorts in the groin, that's always good for fun and amusement. That's just icing on the cake."" But Overstock is not the first business to embrace Bitcoin. British entrepreneur Richard Branson made a splash in November when he announced that his that his commercial space travel venture, Virgin Galactic, will allow customers to pay for their flights with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been a particularly popular investment in China , but regulators have been cracking down . This week, China's largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, abruptly stopped accepting new deposits. That came after China's central bank issued a warning and announced new rules for financial institutions dealing in bitcoins earlier this month. European Union officials have also warned about the risks of Bitcoin and may consider regulating the currency.","Overstock to accept Bitcoin - Dec. 20, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/20/technology/innovation/overstock-bitcoin/

Zynga first posted the news solely on social news site Reddit on Friday , explaining the Bitcoin experiment is a test limited to certain games. The test -- which Zynga is conducting with Bitcoin service provider BitPay -- will let players use the ""cryptocurrency"" for in-game purchases in FarmVille 2, CastleVille, ChefVille, CoasterVille, Hidden Chronicles, Hidden Shadows and CityVille. While many Zynga customers play games for free, some opt to pay real money for virtual goods like cows, crops and other items to help them progress. Zynga ( ZNGA ) is launching the experiment ""in response to Bitcoin's rise in popularity around the world,"" the company said in its Reddit post. A company spokeswoman confirmed the post's veracity on Monday, but she declined to comment further. Bitcoin's meteoric rise was one of the hottest tech stories in 2013. The so-called cryptocurrency, created in 2009 , lets people buy goods anonymously. Bitcoins can be bought and sold on marketplaces like Mt. Gox, or ""mined"" using computers to solve complex math problems. Some buy bitcoins as an investment. That speculative interest has pushed the price of bitcoins higher and higher, from $13 last January to more than $1,200 in December 2013 -- leading to bubble concerns and volatile price swings. The Zynga news helped push Bitcoin higher on Monday, when the price briefly climbing to nearly $1,100 apiece on Mt.

378,"JPMorgan patents Bitcoin-like payment system. JPMorgan Chase has patented a digital payment system that could rival Bitcoin. The system includes digital wallets, the ability to transfer money to anyone and anonymity too, according to a patent application filed to the U.S. Patent and Trade Office on Aug. 5. A blog on Let's Talk Bitcoin first reported the story. JPMorgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) has also patented payment software that would latch onto your Internet browser and allow you to shop without pausing to fill out forms with personal financial information. And with what the bank calls its Internet Pay Anyone Account, moving funds would be anonymous and as easy as sending an email. ""The credit pushes can be made completely anonymously, with the recipient of the credit having no way to determine from where the credit originated,"" the bank says in the application. Another aspect of the digital payment system is a virtual private lockbox. Think of it as a bank account that can only accept funds. That way, users can receive funds from anyone by publishing its digital address publicly without fear that someone can pull money out of it. The impetus for the project is likely Bitcoin , the independent electronic currency created in 2009 that has gained lots of recent attention . But the patent application shows no mention of Bitcoin. It does, however, say what led to its development: The modern financial system is outdated. In the patent application, JPMorgan notes two trends that are making the old banking system obsolete. One is that merchants are establishing direct relationships with customers -- and they don't want middlemen slowing down the transfer of money. The second is that digital products are often sold in small increments for very low prices, and the currently high price of per-transaction fees don't make sense. ""A new marketplace has emerged for low dollar, high volume, real-time payments with payment surety for both consumers and producers,"" the bank writes in the application.","JPMorgan patents Bitcoin-like payment system - Dec. 10, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/10/technology/bitcoin-jpmorgan/

380,"Savings account lotteries: Win up to $25,000. LaVerne and DeAnn Brickner won $25,000 through their prize-linked savings account. Click the image above for more stories from winners. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) DeAnn Brickner dropped the phone on the living room floor when she got the call last January telling her that she and her husband, LaVerne, had just won $25,000. The couple had bought a handful of lottery tickets throughout the year, but it wasn't a Mega Millions or Powerball official on the phone -- it was someone from their local credit union. ""[My wife] just stood there in shock ... I had no clue what was going on, I thought someone had died,"" said LaVerne, who is from Kearney, Neb. ""We went to bed that night going, 'Wow, tell us this again when we wake up in the morning to make sure we're not dreaming.'"" Across the country, states are passing legislation allowing credit unions to offer prize-linked savings accounts, where customers are entered into a lottery and given the chance to win an annual grand prize of up to $25,000. It all started in Michigan. Unlike most states, Michigan's law already allowed credit unions to offer games of chance, like a raffle or a lottery. In 2009, eight credit unions in the state began offering prize-linked certificates of deposit through a program called Save to Win. Since then, the program has grown its fleet of credit unions to 58, and the average savings account balance has increased from $734 to $2,873, with the majority of customers rolling over their 12-month CDs from year-to-year. That success has led other states to take notice. In addition to Michigan, six other states have passed laws allowing credit unions to offer prize-linked savings accounts, according to the Doorways to Dreams Fund, which helped launch the Save to Win program. Connecticut is the latest to do so, passing legislation last year, and a New York bill is expected to be reintroduced this year. And while federal law prohibits banks from running lotteries, a new bill introduced in Congress in October would make it possible for these institutions to offer prize-linked savings accounts in states that also permit it. Here's how it works: When you sign up for a 12-month CD and deposit at least $25, you receive one ticket for the lottery. Every $25 you add to the account after that qualifies you for another chance to win -- up to a maximum of 10 chances per month. But if you dip into that CD before its maturity date, you're typically charged a $25 fee, and you're only allowed to withdraw money once per term. Individual credit unions hold monthly drawings where you can win small prizes of $50 and up, and then there's an annual lottery run by all participating credit unions in the state that selects the grand prize winners. ""When [participants] find out they get a prize, they are just ecstatic because most are hardworking, middle-class people,"" said Dave Adams, CEO of the Michigan Credit Union League. ""These accounts are not geared toward people with lots of money, they're geared toward people who aren't regular savers."" In a recent survey of Save to Win members, between 42% and 59% (depending on the state) described themselves as ""non-regular savers,"" and between 35% and 55% said they earned less than $40,000. Save a million before you retire. Prize-linked savings accounts operate differently depending on the state. In Michigan, the credit union pays a subscription fee of between $1,000 and $10,000, which is pooled in order to pay out 10 annual grand prizes of $10,000 each. In Nebraska, there's only one grand prize winner per year, but the prize is $25,000. Since 2009, credit unions have doled out more than $1 million to more than 10,000 Save to Win customers -- with 22 people winning $10,000 or more. What's in it for credit unions? More deposits, and more loyal customers who may begin taking out loans or opening credit cards, says Adams. Between 55% and 75% of Save to Win customers said they are more likely to use another product at their credit union after using the prize-linked saving account. Overall, more than 40,000 Save to Win accounts have been opened and $70 million has been saved through the program between 2009 and 2012. Meanwhile, a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that prize-linked savings accounts do indeed lead consumers to save more than a regular interest-bearing account.

381,"Why is saving money so hard? Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard University and a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ""genius"" grant, answers the big question of why setting aside money for the future is so difficult. Why is saving so hard? There's a popular image of people who don't save for the future as lacking in self-control. But the reason saving is so hard has less to do with self-control and more to do with a scarcity of attention. If you have urgent current expenses to cover, then future priorities like college and retirement fall off your radar because they are simply less pressing. That's a theme of Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much, your new book with Princeton professor Eldar Shafir. When saving is so hard, how can you get better at it ? People think saving is difficult because they think it requires a heroic tightening of your budget. In reality, you can make a big dent with automation and by capitalizing on a few opportunities requiring self-control. For example, I have a healthy savings rate. But I don't consciously save anything. I just have a chunk of every paycheck go straight to a savings account. With the money I get, I actually spend willy-nilly. I overcame my scarcity of foresight by setting up this system. It's like jumping into a pool: You just have to steel yourself and do it once, and you get benefits going forward. The ability to save automatically is among the most powerful tools available to us. How do you know it's so strong? One piece of evidence is a study of investors in TIAA-CREF a few years back. After having chosen their 401(k) mix, the median number of times people changed their asset mix in any way over their working life was zero. The best use of automation is something like the ""Save More Tomorrow"" program [developed by behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi]. It sets up a regular deduction that doesn't kick in right away. This is how companies sell you things: They start out cheap, then you're automatically moved to a paid subscription later. You should do the same with your savings. What if you don't have a steady paycheck? How do you save? In that case, you can't just automatically put aside money. The question is what you do at times of abundance -- say, if you get a tax refund. You have a magical opportunity to escape scarcity. But studies show that if I give you an abundance shock of $10,000, you don't just spend that $10,000. You end up spending $20,000, because you're thinking, ""I have all this extra money."" Save money without a steady income. You forget how you felt under the conditions of scarcity. You need to think, ""Instead of using this windfall to buy something nice, I should put it in a savings account."" Are there any good tools for getting yourself to do this? There's a cool website I've used, FutureMe.org. It lets you write an email to yourself to be delivered later. Say you are struggling to make a credit card payment. You send yourself an email to arrive in December, when you're going to get your Christmas bonus, saying, ""Remember last March when making that payment was a pain? I don't want to be back there. As attractive as shopping is right now, let's put some of our bonus toward paying down the credit card."" In addition to making it hard to save for the future, how does financial scarcity affect us? Our thoughts constantly go back to making ends meet, even if we are trying to focus on something else. The starkest implication of this, which we have evidence for, is that the same person has significantly less mental capacity to address a problem when he is poor than when he is well-off. It is safe to say that when people are short on cash they might be less productive at work, be worse parents, and have less self-control. What's the effect of scarcity on a societal level? Over the past 12 years, the mood in the U.S. has gone from a sense of plenty to one of anxiety. A reasonable hypothesis is that as the U.S. has gotten into a recession and more people have making ends meet on their mind, we are actually becoming less productive, less intelligent, with lower self-control. How would we treat austerity and recessions if we knew they were hurting our mental capacity? Along with your work on scarcity, you've studied financial advice a lot. People often worry whether they can trust their adviser. Can they? You can trust some of them some of the time. But a lot of advisers have financial incentives to sell specific products, which gets them to push funds that invest heavily in a particular stock or sector. In a study I co-authored, we hired actors who pretended to seek financial advice. When some of them told advisers they already had their money in a good low-cost index fund, a significant majority of advisers tried to convince them to switch to some undiversified high-load fund. That was especially depressing. So how can people avoid that trap? For many people, target life-cycle funds can do a lot of work: They adjust the riskiness of your portfolio over time. All you need to do is to pick your retirement age. You can also go to advisers that charge you by the hour and don't make money by selling you products. But you need to be self-aware too: We all have this urge to be told what we already want to hear. In a study that Antoinette Schoar of MIT just finished, she found this striking problem in the demand for advice: If one adviser says, ""Look, you can't beat the market; the best thing you can do is be in a low-cost diversified fund,"" and another adviser says, ""I think that the tech sector is ready to rebound, and I've got a fund that would be good for that,"" people find the second adviser more knowledgeable and trustworthy. It's like going to two doctors and preferring the doctor who offers you snake oil -- and giving him an incentive to dispense snake oil. So you should make clear to your adviser that you are okay with being contradicted -- that you are comfortable hearing perspectives at odds with your own. People save more, Mullainathan found in one study, when they get regular reminders. They do even better when they can picture a goal. Mullainathan's research has also spotlighted a particular downside of being short on cash: It makes it harder to think.","Why is saving money so hard? - Dec. 17, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/01/leadership/saving-money.moneymag/index.html
382,"What the new mortgage rules mean for you. ""No debt traps. No surprises. No runarounds,"" the CFPB's Richard Cordray, said of the new rules. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) New mortgage lending rules are going into effect Friday that aim to put an end to the worst mortgage lending abuses of the past. The new rules are designed to take a ""back to basics"" approach to mortgage lending and lower the risk of defaults and foreclosures among borrowers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which issued the new rules. ""No debt traps. No surprises. No runarounds. These are bedrock concepts backed by our new common-sense rules, which take effect today,"" said CFPB director Richard Cordray in remarks prepared for a hearing Friday. Mortgage lenders are being asked to comply with two new requirements: The Ability to Repay rule and Qualified Mortgages. Here's how they will impact borrowers: Ability to Repay. Lenders must determine that a borrower has the income and assets to afford to make payments throughout the life of the loan. To do so, the lender may look at your debt-to-income ratio, which is how much you owe divided by how much you earn per month, including the highest mortgage payments you would be required to make under the terms of the loan. To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, add up all your monthly obligations -- including student loan, credit card and car payments, housing costs, utilities and other recurring expenses -- and divide it by your monthly gross income. In an effort to put an end to no- or low-doc loans, where lenders issue risky mortgages without the necessary financial information, lenders will be required to document and verify an applicant's income, assets, credit history and debt. For borrowers, that means more paperwork and longer processing times. Underwriters must also approve mortgages based on the maximum monthly charges you face, not just low ""teaser rates"" that last only a matter of months, or a year or two, before resetting higher. Qualified Mortgages. To make sure you aren't taking on more house than you can afford, your debt-to-income ratio generally must be below 43%. This rule is not absolute. Banks can still make loans to people with debt-to-income ratios that are greater than that if other factors, such as a high level of assets, justify the risk. Qualified mortgages cannot include risky features, such as terms longer than 30 years, interest-only payments or minimum payments that don't keep up with interest so your mortgage balance grows . Upfront fees and charges cannot add up to more than 3% of the mortgage balance. That includes title insurance, origination fees and points paid to lower mortgage interest rates. The rules also restrict ""steering,"" or practices that give financial incentives to loan officers or mortgage brokers for pushing people into higher-interest loans that they can't afford -- a practice that was all too common leading up to the housing bust, Cordray said. ""We think the new rules are balanced and well-drawn. They will offer consumers protection without limiting credit to qualified borrowers , "" said Gary Kalman, the policy director for the Center for Responsible Lending. Zillow CEO: Hottest housing markets. Lenders don't seem to be too worried about the new rules, according to Keith Gumbinger of HSH.com, a mortgage information provider. ""It's no surprise; everybody has been preparing for the change for months,"" he said. ""Because there will be additional underwriting scrutiny, it could gum up the works initially and slow loan processing, but it's really just the codification of things that are already in place."" A significant factor is what's not in the rules. There's no minimum down payment or credit score requirement. ""[The qualifed mortgage] is not taking a one-size-fits-all approach. It ensures that first time homebuyers can still come to the table,"" said Kalman. If the rules required a minimum down payment of, say 10% or 20%, it would eliminate many first time buyers who would have a difficult time raising that much cash. The lack of a credit score requirement will enable lenders to loosen currently tight underwriting standards in the future should conditions warrant, according to Gumbinger. For the moment, most loans will still have to be backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and, with a few exceptions, they won't approve applicants with scores below 620.","What the new mortgage rules mean for you - Jan. 10, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/10/real_estate/mortgage-rules/index.html

384,"Airline exec goes all in with racehorse company. ""This is a big improvement over going to an office,"" says Steve Zerda, 55, of Seattle. (Money Magazine) Steve Zerda's 25-year career in the airline industry followed a predictable flight path until, in 2010, he encountered a racehorse called Turbulent Descent. The horse's owners were selling stakes to investors -- while keeping a majority interest -- and the avid racing fan decided to buy in. ""What I saw was a unique business model, where the owner could spread the risk,"" says Zerda. ""And I could participate, without spending a fortune."" A director overseeing aircraft-component maintenance at Alaska Airlines, Zerda had already decided to take early retirement later that year. His investment in Turbulent Descent gave him an idea for a new career: Buy yearlings, train them to run, then sell partnerships. After consulting trainers -- and confirming there were few syndicates for small-scale investors in Seattle -- he wrote a business plan. His first acquisition as Z Thoroughbred Racing was a colt called Harbor Wind for $10,000. (With purses at the nearby track capped at $100,000, he didn't want to be saddled with costly horses.) He then set to work revving up interest via word-of-mouth and a website, soliciting investors to buy stakes of at least 5%. The money he raises helps fund grooming, training, and care, which runs more than $25,000 a year per animal. With such high overhead, showing a profit requires winning races and, in the process, making horses appealing to breeders. The risk is great, of course -- ""you can buy any dumpy horse and lose your shirt fast,"" Zerda says -- but so is the potential reward. Harbor Wind raced 18 times in three years, earning over $50,000. Turbulent Descent won $900,000 before being sold for 12 times his original price. 'I quit banking to make ice cream' Today, Zerda owns six horses and has a 10% stake in another. Thanks to winning purses plus proceeds from three sales, Z Thoroughbred made a $45,000 profit last year. ""I seem to be able to locate good value,"" says Zerda, who reinvested the earnings. ""And I have a good time doing it."" BY THE NUMBERS. $50,000: Capital Zerda used to launch the business. He determined that this amount -- from a deferred bonus he got when leaving his job -- would allow him to buy a horse a year for the first few years before he could bring in investors. (He has since sold 19 partnerships, with stakes from 5% to 20%.) 5 years : Period before quitting that he power-saved. As a result, he and his wife, Lisa, a director for a health insurer, have nearly $750,000 for retirement. The couple, who have two kids attending state colleges and a 15-year-old at home, are able to live on Steve's pension and Lisa's salary. 100%: Earnings he'll reinvest for the next few years. Zerda plans to forgo a salary -- he used to make $120,000 -- to grow the business. He'll continue buying yearlings, with hopes of selling them when they are around age 5, for three to five times what he paid. ""Horses tend to retire once they've made $1 million,"" he says. ""I'd like to position myself to follow that example.""","Airline exec goes all in with racehorse company - Dec. 26, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/01/smallbusiness/racehorse-owner.moneymag/index.html

Instead, according to the Miami Herald, it was a feud with coach Joe Philbin . It started with Ireland complaining about Philbin and word getting back to the second-year coach through executive vice president Dawn Aponte. Philbin and Ireland barely spoke after the season and Ireland was axed two weeks later, days after offensive coordinator Mike Sherman was canned. Now, the search for replacement begins, and the Herald depicts an unfavorable situation for the once proud franchise. The new GM or ìfootball czarî would have to accept Philbin as the head coach and understand Aponte will hold some power. Sound familiar, Jets fans? The team went through a similar shaming last season after GM Mike Tannenbaum was fired and Rex Ryan was kept on as coach. John Idzik eventually accepted the position, but the relationship between him and Ryan remains a source of speculation. And this name is definitely familiar to Jets fans: Eric Mangini was floated by the Herald as a potential Ireland replacement.

The easiest thing in the world is to go out and just hang it out there like whatever, weíre not going to do anything.

387,"The Jets announced they are bringing head coach Rex Ryan back for at least one more season after Sundayís 20-7 victory over the Dolphins at Sun Life Stadium ó and the Jets players celebrated. Owner Woody Johnson told the team in the victorious locker room Ryan would return. The players began jumping around and surrounded Ryan, giving him hugs that knocked his hat off. ìYouíd think we won the Super Bowl,î quarterback Geno Smith said. Johnson and general manager John Idzik informed Ryan he would return before the Jets took the field for pregame warm-ups. Ryan has one year remaining on his contract. No one would disclose whether he has been given an extension beyond next year, but that is expected. ìWeíre clearly on the ascent,î Johnson told reporters. ìA lot of it is due to our coach, coach Rex Ryan. Weíre going to keep Rex Ryan and heíll be our coach next year.î Questions have surrounded Ryanís future since the end of last season when Johnson fired GM Mike Tannenbaum but retained Ryan. Idzik was hired weeks later and there was speculation Idzik may want to hire his own coach. But the Jets went into 2013 with low expectations and made it to 8-8 with Sundayís victory, a win total no one expected with a roster of limited talent.

They have missed the playoffs for three straight seasons after going to back-to-back AFC title games in Ryanís first two seasons. All of that speculation ended Sunday with Johnsonís announcement. Players described Ryan as extremely emotional. He had trouble speaking he was so overcome. ìI love being the head coach of the New York Jets, plain and simple,î Ryan told reporters. ìYou put everything youíve got into it. I never wanted to go out this way, another losing season or something like that. I know we never went to the playoffs three straight years and that bothers me, no question.î Johnson and Idzik would not say exactly when they reached their decision, but Johnson said it was before these final two games, the first two consecutive wins the Jets have had this season. There are also questions about what Ryanís coaching staff will look like with the contracts up of many of the assistant coaches. ìHeís been tremendous to work for ó to work with,î Idzik said. ìHeís a leader. Heís a motivator. Heís a teacher. Heís a heck of a coach. Heís a great guy to work with. Iíve always made the assumption that weíre working together with this thing to formulate a winning team.î The Jets put together another strong performance for Ryan on Sunday and knocked the Dolphins out of the playoff chase. The Jets seized control of the game midway through the second quarter and never surrendered it. Smith played one of his best games of the season and his second straight without a turnover. Smith went 17-for-27 for 190 yards and ran for a touchdown just before halftime to put the Jets up 14-7. The defense shut the Dolphins down and intercepted quarterback Ryan Tannehill three times. The Jets have played their best football in the final three weeks of the season. It left them thinking about what might have been if they didnít stumble during a three-game losing streak in mid-November to early December. ìIf we had five more games, it would be interesting, man,î Calvin Pace said. ìThat being said, you win the last game and hopefully thereís some carryover into the offseason. Hopefully that goes into the preseason and you just keep moving forward. The skyís the limit for this team.î Before the game, the players said they wanted to win the game for Ryan. ìAs a team we came together and said listen the time for talk is over,î wide receiver David Nelson said. ìWe can sit here and tell the media and the fans about how much we want him, but really the most powerful way to keep him is to play and to prove that on the field.î They did that Sunday and their wish was granted ó the Rex Ryan era ainít over yet. Did the Jets exceed your expectations at 8-8? This JETS team absolutely maxed their talent. New backfield...rookie QB....turned over secondary. . .no name receivers...anyone who says otherwise is a fool.

Great job Ryan...great decision Idzik/ Johnson. love reading the Jet fans reasoning/excuse making. Win something then you can talk- but seriously going after Brady and Brees and comparing Geno with them? ... let him develop, win one and then you can say he's on his way. go 8-8 in a weak AFC and win useless games does not make him on par with living legends...it does speak to overexposure. Watching the Miami game was a treat... You saw a motivated, eager, hungry New York Jets team that has a new Franchise quarterback in the making. Every stop they ""had"" to make on defense they made. They made critical interceptions that changed the game. They BLANKED Miami and left them guessing for 30 Minutes.† Mid-way through the season a Jets fan told me ""Geno is not the answer"". My only question ""Name the last Quarterback to defeat both Brees and Brady in the regular season... He's that good. Calm, upbeat - even when things don't go his way. I'd take Geno Smith any day over Andrew Luck or Tannehill. Give Geno some star receivers and running backs - watch how he manages the offense next season... Congratulations Rex! You've earned and deserve the right to continue to lead the Jets. Kudos also to John Idzik, who has had a solid first year as GM. Marty M. and David Lee give every indication that they are the right men to lead the offense and develop whatever talent is brought onboard as the team moves forward. After the teams two year descent into darkness there is, at last, reason for optimism going into 2014. Finally, yes, the Jets have exceeded mine and everyone elses expectations this year, at 8-8. As much as Ryan was a blowhard, there is no doubt that he has an ability to coach a team. With his back against the wall, this was coach of the year work. Geno made Sanchez look great, Milliner was having a terrible time adjusting -- all Idzik's guys. Somehow Ryan created a great defensive core and a passable offense. This team was not expected to win more than 4 games. You can tell that Idzik is not happy and wishes he could boot out Ryan this year. It's going to be awkward again come next year. Perhaps they will negotiate a buyout because Idzik is going nowhere. While they just missed the playoffs, this was a great ride for any football fan (except the Dolphins.) Talk about a blowhard! Your backhand compliments are as off the mark as your misreading of the relationship between Rex and John Idzik. Then, in a bid to prove just how clueless you are, you dismiss the fine job Idzik did in his first year with an excellent draft and successful trade to aquire Chris Ivory. But you are the laughing stock of todays comments section so you do have that going for you. As I ruffle through the pages of my memory it takes me to Cleveland.

The Jets were tied with the Dolphins, 7-7, late in the first half and faced a third-and-goal from the Miami 7-yard line with 9 seconds remaining before halftime. The play called for a quarterback keeper by Jets rookie Geno Smith. Powell stoned defensive end Cameron Wake, the Dolphins best defensive player, with a punishing block to seal him off to the right of Smithís running lane. That in itself would have been enough to be called a textbook-perfect play, but Powell was not finished. Powell wheeled around after putting Wake to the ground and saw Smith was caught up at the goal line trying to wrestle his way into the end zone with Miamiís best linebacker, Dannell Ellerbe, preventing him from breaking the plane. And, before the whistle could be blown signaling the stop of forward progress, Powell plowed into Smith and Ellerbe and blew them both into the end zone. That made it 14-7 Jets with 3 seconds remaining in the half, sent the teamís sideline into a frenzy, and the Jets would never lose the lead as they finished up the season 8-8. ìOur whole mind-set here was to come down here and not get denied, so when I saw Geno get stood up, I was like, ëExtra help,í íí said Powell, who rarely speaks to reporters out of shyness. ìI was on Wake and I looked up and saw Geno go past me and he kind of got stood up and his momentum stopped a little bit. So I tried to give him an extra push. It wasnít too much, but it was enough to get him [in the end zone] through.íí ìBilal is just such a good football player and so underrated with such a big heart,íí Jets coach Rex Ryan said. ìMan, he just produces. We lost our big horse [Chris Ivory to a hip injury early in the game] and Bilal stepped it up like he always does.íí His effort on the play, arguably the biggest of the day, surprised no one on the Jets considering how dependable and durable Powell has been. Receiver David Nelson said Powellís play symbolized the entire team. ìThatís the makeup of this team,íí Nelson said. ìWe donít have a lot of stars, no Pro Bowl guys except for a couple alternates. We have a bunch of guys who love the game, respect the game and play the right way, and Bilal is a testament to that.íí The flashiest play Powell made was the halfback-option pass he threw to tight end Jeff Cumberland in the fourth quarter. It set up a Nick Folk field goal that sealed the win. ìTrust me, I did a lot of practicing this week,íí Powell said. ìI canít even count on both hands and feet how many times we practiced that [pass]. My hat goes off to the offensive coaching staff for having enough trust in me at that critical time in the game to even call that play up.íí Powell said the last time he completed a pass was in high school. ìWeíll see what the future holds with that situation,íí he said. ìThatís Genoís job to keep, trust me.íí What's Your Take? Powell does everything good but nothing great. He's not a featured back but he's a player that does everything right. Reminds me a LITTLE of Curtis Martin in that way. Martin wasn't that fast, wasn't that big or wasn't the kind of guy that was going to run you over but no one got more out of their ability than he did. When it comes to Powell, Rex said it best ìBilal is just such a good football player and so underrated with such a big heart,íí. He's not big and strong, he's not fast, heck, he doesn't even look like an NFL RB, he just makes plays. Every team needs a guy like Powell.

389,"New York Times redesign points to future of online publishing. The last time The New York Times embarked on a wholesale redesign of its Web site, in 2006, the iPhone wasn't on the market. Tablets like the iPad were still years away. So the new design that The Times is unveiling Wednesday is generating much interest within the journalism industry, both for what it says about The Times and about the future of online publishing. For visitors to NYTimes.com , it will be obvious ""that we've redesigned our article pages and restyled our homepage and section fronts to provide a cleaner, more engaging user experience,"" said Denise Warren, the executive vice president of the digital products and services group at The Times. What won't be obvious is this: behind the curtain, there is a whole new publishing and technology system. ""This allows us to continually iterate on the site and take advantage of new technology trends as they happen, so instead of seeing major redesigns in the future, users will see more incremental changes over time,"" Warren said. While the refreshed home page and article pages retain some of the feel of the print newspaper, the redesign highlights the fact that, as the well-respected news media analyst Ken Doctor put it, ""digital publishing is getting to be the main publishing system of the Times, with print becoming a niche, if still a very big one."" Redesigns of Web sites as massive as NYTimes.com are fraught with complexity, not to mention the possibility that readers will be turned off by the changes. The Times, the flagship brand of The New York Times Company ( NYT ) , has been testing the new design internally for some time and adjusting it along the way. A disclosure is important here: I was a media reporter at The Times for six years. While there, I occasionally engaged in a time-honored reporter ritual -- complaining -- in this case about the limitations of The Times' online publishing tools. But I also gained respect for the people in charge of those tools. I departed The Times in November 2013, and for this story, I refrained from speaking with any former colleagues about the redesign outside of formal interviews. Many outside The Times see it as a Cadillac of print and online publishing ó so it's not surprising that the redesign has already generated press attention. Fast Company magazine said this week that the newspaper has "" eight years of catching up to do ."" The new site is designed with mobile readership in mind, now that roughly a third of its traffic comes from users on smart phones and tablets. ""It was important that we created a responsive layout that enhances the presentation of our content on larger desktops down to tablets,"" Warren said. Doctor said that ""the flip side is that two-thirds of all the traffic still comes from desktops and laptops. So while the mobile news revolution is hugely important, the Web still brings most of the digital readers and most of the digital advertising."" The new system also allows for new kinds of advertising, which is critical for The Times because digital advertising revenues have been trending downward. In the third quarter of last year, the revenues were down 3.4% versus the same quarter the prior year. Most notably, the redesign introduces fast-growing ""native advertising"" to NYTimes.com. The Times is calling these ads Paid Posts. They resemble articles written by reporters ó thus they are ""native"" ó but they are actually written by sponsors. Dell is the first purchaser of Paid Posts, and on Wednesday, there were several such posts on the Web site. The Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. acknowledged in a memorandum last month that ads that appear to be articles ""can be controversial"" among journalists, but said he expected that ""native advertising will play a part in helping restore digital advertising revenue to growth -- something we need to do to support our investment in the journalism of The New York Times."" The Paid Posts are surrounded by a blue border to distinguish them from regular articles; are prefaced with a disclaimer that they are ""paid for and posted by"" outside companies; and are formatted in a different font. There are other kinds of new ads on NYTimes.com too, including something called a ""Ribbon unit"" that will show up within the new top-of-the-page navigation bar. (Dell's Paid Posts appeared there on Wednesday.) ""The design also creates more white space, which makes advertising units more prominent now than they have been in the past,"" Warren said. Even as it tries to improve its digital advertising picture, The Times is increasingly dependent on subscribers for revenue; at last count it had upwards of 700,000 digital subscribers. The company's hope is that a richer Web site will keep those subscribers happy and woo new ones. ""The more readers engage -- finding an intriguing movie profile when they came to the site to follow the latest news from Afghanistan -- the more likely they are to renew their subscriptions and accept annual price increases,"" Doctor said. He also noted that one ""small but noticeable change"" will be faster-loading Web pages on NYTimes.com. ""Of course, the more of them, the more page views and that reinforcement of engagement,"" he said.","New York Times redesign points to future of online publishing - Jan. 8, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/08/technology/innovation/new-york-times-redesign/index.html
390,"Why 2014 is the year to get out of debt. The Fed has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero, which should keep many consumer loans from getting more expensive. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) When it comes to your personal finances, 2014 may be your best chance to take advantage of low interest rates and get out of debt -- before it really starts costing you. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed has made monthly bond purchases in order to keep rates extraordinarily low and encourage consumer spending and borrowing. With the economy on the mend, the Fed is now slowly pulling back on those purchases, or tapering. Long-term interest rates have already risen in anticipation of the Fed's decision, so there likely won't be a rapid spike in mortgage rates, which are already more than a percentage point higher than last year's historic lows. Still, prospective borrowers could see mortgage rates reach more than 5% this year as the economy continues to strengthen, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president at mortgage information site HSH.com. But many other consumer loans should remain cheap since they are tied to short-term interest rates, which the Fed has committed to keeping near zero. The so-called prime rate, the rate at which banks lend to their best customers, has stayed at 3.25% since 2008 and isn't expected to move higher in 2014. As a result, borrowers will continue to enjoy lower rates on student loans, car loans and credit cards, among other short-term loans. But that won't always be the case, and that makes now a good time to tackle those credit card bills, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. ""The message I would give to borrowers is 2014 could be your last hurrah,"" he said. ""The days are numbered. It makes sense to plan accordingly and really start to hammer away."" Currently, credit cards are charging an average annual percentage rate of around 15%. While borrowers with poor credit can face higher double-digit rates, the most creditworthy consumers will continue to see APRs in the single digits, and will receive 0% introductory offers for as long as 18 months, said McBride. Even the difference of a few percentage points can make a big difference. Let's say you resolve to pay off $5,000 worth of credit card debt in a year. A card with a 10% interest rate would ultimately result in $275 in interest payments on top of the $5,000. If the interest rate were to jump to 15%, the same payoff would require $416 in interest, an increase of more than 50%. Car loans are also expected to stay near record lows this year, with 3% to 4% offers remaining fairly common, McBride said. Similar to car loans, many private student loan borrowers will continue to enjoy low single-digit rates. But that doesn't mean they will stay there. Private student loans are typically tied to the prime rate or the rate at which banks lend to other banks, called Libor. That makes it a good time to pay down that student loan bill, since these loans typically carry variable rates that will jump when rates rise in coming years. Bernanke on Fed taper in 90 seconds. But there's also a downside to low interest rates. It will be yet another frustrating year for savers. Savings accounts, money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit will continue to have average returns far below 1%. A typical savings account with deposits of $1,000, for example, will earn less than $1 in annual interest. Five-year CDs, which currently have average returns of around 0.8%, may offer slightly higher rates later this year but returns will remain paltry. ""The bottom line is [rates] could double, and it still wouldn't be enough to get you off the couch,"" he said.","Why 2014 is the year to get out of debt - Jan. 8, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/08/pf/expert/interest-rates-2014/index.html
391,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. So now we know. Thank you, Headlines Today, for revealing the deep-rooted conspiracy at the heart of todayís politics. No, it has nothing to do with Muzaffarnagar and possible LeT recruitment in the refugee camps there ó the subject of much debate on NDTV 24◊7, Times Now and CNN-IBN, Tuesday night. No, Headlines Today has snooped around and come up with a new expose of the Congress. What, again? What now? Now, itís the Congressís AAP ìgameplanî. Itís Machiavellian ìplotî is to have the AAP erode the BJPís vote share in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in anything between 50-100 seats, depending on whether the new partyís vote share is 5 or 10 per cent. Headlines Today buttressed its argument by citing the example of Raj Thackerayís MNS in Maharashtra during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, where it played a spoiler for the BJP-Shiv Sena by eating into their vote share ó and, as a result, helping the Congress win more seats. What was unclear from this fascinating piece of journalism is the precise nature of the role played by the Congress in the current AAP electoral strategy. From all that we have learnt from media reports, the AAP has decided to fight a large number of Lok Sabha seats ó but without consulting Rahul G or Sonia ji. So where is the Congress hand in the AAP ìgameplanî? Headlines Today doesnít say. The AAP may or may not eat into the BJPís vote share, but certainly it has already eaten into the BJPís media exposure. How often do you see Narendra Modi on your news channels nowadays? Sporadically, where once he was a daily, nay an hourly fixture. Since the December assembly election results, heís been replaced by AAP, Muzaffarnagar, Rahul Gandhi and even the prime minister in the pecking order. This hiatus from the media spotlight may be good for the BJPís prime ministerial candidate: many would say, Modi has been overexposed too early in the run-up to this summerís elections. Watching Hindi entertainment channels is to live inside a bubble that insulates you from the world outside. Other than crime shows such as Crime Patrol Dastak (Sony), TV shows fail to mirror contemporary urban life ó or even provide a glancing reference to the social and political upheavals we are witnessing, say, in a city like Delhi. A show like Nandini (Sony) has young people, including an ìaamî woman, striving in the political sphere but it is an exception. Otherwise, you have shows such as Firangi Bahu (Sahara One) where one Camili Jonathan is married into the Desai family residing in Rajkot. Sheís more the Indian bahu than Sonia Gandhi or Kahani Ghar Ghar Kiís ideal, Parvati. So what if she is blond? Thatís just a hair colour away, anyway. She wears a saree, performs all the duties of a perfect daughter-in-law and even speaks in Hindi. Well, if you can call it that. She sounds like pebbles are weighing down her tongue, that too curiously for an Englishwoman, with an American accent. Remind me, why do we make shows such as this one?",Plots and gameplans | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/plots-and-gameplans/

MORE ON: LAS VEGAS ó One of the most-mocked features of the more recent ìStar Trekî television series ó the bodysuit ó may soon be the next big thing in wearable tech. But it would be no ordinary bodysuit. The tech-heavy bodysuit envisioned by futurist Gray Scott is more of a ìsmartsuitî that will track your vitals, tell you when to go to the doctor, take pictures, check e-mails and help you map out your route. ìNot to totally geek out, but I saw some jogging jackets with electronics sewn into the shoulder and the chest, so weíre already seeing the precursor,î Scott, the founder of SeriousWonder.com, a website that tracks technology trends, told The Post. To be sure, ìwearablesî have been the hot topic of this yearís conference. The word wearables is meant to connote any technology that can do things a smartphone might do, but which is worn rather than held, like the much-reported-on Glass from Google. Production and sales of wearables are expected to soar, more than offsetting the slowing sales of more established tech items like PCs. Meanwhile, products like Google Glass, which can check e-mail, play music and answer the phones, are expensive ($1,500), and the hands-free camera on the face has raised privacy concerns. Nonetheless, this yearís Consumer Electronics Show is brimming with products hoping to make the cut, including watches like Basis that can monitor the wearerís sleep or track stress levels, glasses like Vuzix that can take video, and headsets like Intelís Jarvis that can make appointments like a secretary would. Clothes and jewelry are also joining the trend, including necklaces with Bluetooth technology like Pebble by CRS, and a jacket by Wearable Experiments with GPS to help the wearer navigate. Even chip giant Intel jumped on the clothes trend and used CES to introduce a baby onesie that alerts parents to the babyís activity, as well as a watch that can tell parents when their child has arrived at school. Scott (who has been wandering the floor of CES all week) and other tech experts agree that all these technologies will soon be merged into one. The question is what form they will take. For Scott, itís all about the clothes. ìThis is the year of the wrist revolution,î Scott said, referring to all the smartwatches that have come to market. ìIn five years, it will be the bodysuit revolution, and the suit will track everything and be the main computer.î Scott could not say if the smartsuits will come in breathable fabrics and pretty colors.

393,"Japanís ties with India do not target any country. They are solely intended to strengthen peace and stability in Asia. As the results came in,TV news lost the big picture with all the colour-coding. Television news has a habit of making everything look far more colourful than it actually is. Sunday was a bright and beautiful day for the BJP as the results from the four assembly elections gave them the green signal. For the AAP,it was a red letter day as news of its unprecedented success in Delhi was emblazoned across all channels. But this wasn<U+0092>t enough for TV news. Oh no. They had to paint everything in all the hues of the rainbow <U+0097> and then some. The TV screen was often so cluttered,so filled with colour,it was difficult to concentrate on the results as they came in,or the big picture. DD News was its usual sobersides with its Janadesh poll results in mauve and purple. NDTV India went black and yellow with maps,seat changes,election flashes; Aaj Tak was electric blue and a cheery red with a four-way split screen and breaking news; Zee News had a different colour for every party,every state <U+0097> black,red,green,orange,blue for the results plus election news trailing at the bottom. The anchor on Zee Business was evidently so pleased with what he saw,he couldn<U+0092>t contain his excitement. It also had an eight-way split screen <U+0097> too much. India TV was mercifully sober in green and orange (the colours of the BJP?) while News 24 went blue,red and vanilla for parties and the results. IBN7 had a palette of yellow,blue,green,grey and red,plus campaign shots,state positions,Delhi leads,flashes; India News was filled with faces (eight),party positions for Delhi,results for the states,breaking news <U+0097> impossible to follow because by the time you had taken in each element,the leads had already changed. NDTV 24◊7 was dignified in white and red and a table almost as large as the studio <U+0097> minimalist,soothing,easy on the eye. Times Now was so blue in the face,you wondered if there was a lack of oxygen in the studio with at least 10 people on camera (besides the hidden production team). In addition,it had the spectrum <U+0097> with a bandwidth of columns and colours providing all manner of interesting trends in the results <U+0097> if you could understand any of it: <U+0093>Almost everything is in saffron,everyone is eating into the green except the green,<U+0094> proclaimed Arnab Goswami. Sounded exotic but what did it mean,exactly,that couldn<U+0092>t have been said in simple words? Headlines Today,like Aaj Tak,was blue,red and black while CNN-IBN went with yellow,blue,grey,green for party positions,plus leads,and Delhi positions besides the panelists. ABP took a different route: its anchor scurried from one table to another where staffers were tracking individual states and battles. So we had this riot of colours and figures on party positions that changed more rapidly than the sensex. All this and more,barring the shouting. And questions like,<U+0093>Kaisa lag raha hai?<U+0094> to an AAP candidate who replied,<U+0093>Bahut achha<U+0094> (News X) <U+0097> what else?

Sheila Dikshit was pale but stout-hearted,gracious in defeat but combative (Aaj Tak). She admitted that she did not get the <U+0093>feeling<U+0094> she would lose to Kejriwal but that she had nevertheless taken the defeat in her <U+0093>stride<U+0094>,and no,the defeat had nothing to do with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.

Except that,in this instance,the virgin was still untouched,apparently. To the absolute amazement of host Karan Johar and of those viewers who had tuned into his talk show,actor Salman Khan claimed with a deadpan expression,in a bland voice,that he was still a virgin. Very early into Season 4<U+0092>s opening episode,Khan<U+0092>s first on the show,Johar asked him outright: <U+0093>You<U+0092>re a virgin?<U+0094> <U+0093>Yes,<U+0094> replied Salman Khan,without blinking or blushing. Well,well,well. Who would have thought it,nay,who would have imagined it? None of us who have watched him on screen or read about his (in)famous love life. Johar<U+0092>s incredulity at the admission forced Salman to explain that he had,of course,held hands (even with men) and exchanged other forms and terms of endearment with women,but he had never-ever ever gone all the way.

Hmmmn. It is a sad admission that news TV is almost virginal after Saturday<U+0092>s arrest of the former editor-in-chief of Tehelka,Tarun Tejpal,for alleged rape. Maybe that<U+0092>s why anchors like Rahul Kanwal (Headlines Today) and Arnab Goswami (Times Now) were raising their pitch even higher. On Tuesday night,Kanwal shrieked at his panellists who responded in kind,while discussing a sting on buying ballots with booze by politicians in Delhi. Then,at 10 pm,discussing the proposed communal violence bill,Goswami scaled new heights,screeching at Congressman Sanjay Jha who screeched right back. <U+0093>We are not some kind of gladiators,<U+0094> claimed Goswami. You could have fooled us. Shiv Sena<U+0092>s Rahul Narvekar joined the hullabaloo in the studio until Goswami ordered (yes,ordered) them to be quiet. Meenakshi Lekhi,BJP,suffering from a sore throat,could not shout. Instead,she delivered a measured <U+0093>dystopian<U+0094> argument which was lost on Goswami (perhaps because it was pitched too low?): <U+0093>What is the relevance to the debate?<U+0094> he demanded. She then raised her voice and mayhem followed. Isn<U+0092>t that just typical of TV news? What do you say about Doordarshan National for telecasting an old show,a good old show,Shrikant at 9pm? And Byomkesh Bakshi before that? At the very least,remake the shows. Repeats are acceptable,all channels repeat themselves. However,no self-respecting channel does it at prime time.

The former intern has also asked the SC to constitute a permanent mechanism to deal with sexual harassment cases at the work-place in judicial bodies. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam and comprising Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Shiva Kirti Singh also appointed senior advocates Fali S Nariman and P P Rao as amicus curiae and directed Attorney General G E Vahanvati to assist it in the matter. When the hearing began, the bench asked senior lawyer Harish Salve, who was appearing for the former intern, why the woman had come out against the alleged sexual harassment so late. ìWhy she waited so long? Our apprehension is that even after 20 years when the judge reaches the age of 90 years, complaint can be filed,î the bench observed. Salve replied that once a mechanism is set up to deal with such cases, people will then file the complaint within a reasonable time. He also said the court could fix the timeframe within which a person can complain. The bench said it was inclined to consider these aspects and asked the Centre to file its response within four weeks and posted the case for February 14. ìIt is made clear at the moment we are not expressing any opinion on the averments made in the petition,î the court added. The former intern has also challenged the apex courtís December 5, 2013 resolution in which it was decided that no complaint against its retired judges would be entertained.

Kumar also sought an injunction against the media from reporting anything related to the complaint by the woman, and sought directions to the information and broadcasting ministry to ensure that the media ó electronic, print and online ó does not report any matter except court orders in the case. The defamation complaint also accuses the former intern of ìvicious and gross libelî. She has not been named in the plea, and her name was given to the court in sealed cover only to enable the court to send the notice. The high court bench of Justice Manmohan Singh will pronounce order on the interim injunction plea on Thursday. During Wednesdayís proceedings, however, the judge said that the media could not be stopped from reporting the facts of the proceedings in a fair manner. Also on Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court admitted the womanís petition alleging sexual harassment by Justice Kumar, and issued notices to the retired judge and the central government on her plea for an inquiry. The woman has asked the apex court to consider setting up a mechanism to deal with such cases at workplaces within the judiciary. In the defamation complaint, Justice Kumar said that he had ìlearnt from some sections of the print and electronic media that the purported complaint by the defendant no 5 (the intern) is a product of sinister conspiracy hatched by persons who want to attack the independence of the judiciary and demoralise the courts, especially the higher judiciary, from adjudicating matters wherein corporate houses have high stakesî. The media houses ìgave effect to the intentions of the conspirators in maligning the plaintiff and bringing disrepute to his public officeî, the plea said. Kumar has also alleged that the calls for his resignation from the NGT ìevidences the malafideî and the ìobjects of the conspiracyî. The judge has alleged that he had told The Indian Express that he was unaware of the alleged complaint, and had denied the allegations when contacted by The I.","Defamation suit in HC seeks Rs 5 cr, curbs on reporting; order today | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/defamation-suit-in-hc-seeks-rs-5-cr-curbs-on-reporting-order-today/
397,"LAS VEGAS ó If you love your iPhone but would prefer a physical keyboard, Typo could be for you. But you might want to order soon. BlackBerry, the company that made physical typing on mobile devices an addictive craze, is suing Typo Products LLC, accusing it of copying its world-famous keyboard. The ideaís great: With BlackBerryís ongoing struggles and the rise of touch-only iPhones and Android phones, physical keyboards on mobile devices were headed to obsolescence. Thatís a big loss for people who can use their thumbs to type as fast as 60 words per minute on a physical keyboard. Enter the Typo Keyboard, a Ryan Seacrest-backed phone case that was showcased at this weekís International CES gadget show in Las Vegas. Its similarities with BlackBerry phones are notable: It has angle-cut keys suitable for thumb-typing. The keyboard layout is nearly identical ñ for example, with parentheses above the ìTî and ìYî instead of the ì9<U+2033> and ì0<U+2033> on a typical keyboard. Thick silver bars separate rows of keys. Physically, there are a few differences. Because the Typo case covers the iPhoneís home button, it added one with the same function on the bottom right. Thereís a Bluetooth function on the ì0<U+2033> key so the Typo can connect to the iPhone wirelessly. A light bulb key on the bottom left gives Typoís keys some lighting to use in dark environments. THE DISPUTE: In a federal lawsuit filed Friday in San Francisco, BlackBerry Ltd. alleges that ìTypo chose to copy BlackBerryís iconic keyboard designî and is making money off of BlackBerryís widespread recognition and goodwill. Typo responded in a statement that BlackBerryís claims ìlack meritî and that the company is excited about its ìinnovative keyboard design.î LOOK AND FEEL: In my hands, the Typo works fine ñ just like a BlackBerry ñ except it is blocked from using Apple Inc.ís autocorrect function while typing. So that means you have to tap misspelled words that are underlined in red later and choose from options to fix them. If you have an iPhone 5S, the fingerprint sensor will be covered up, so youíll have to resort to inputting a passcode. DEVELOPMENT: Laurence Hallier, the CEO and co-founder of Typo, said testers of the device included BlackBerry users and others. ìWe wanted that thumb-typing like the BlackBerry,î he said. ìWe went out and priced it out. We built prototypes. It took us 18 months.î Typo Products is a Los Angeles startup co-founded by Seacrest and Hallier. AVAILABILITY: Typo sells for $99 and is expected to start shipping on Monday. It works only with the iPhone 5 and 5S, not the 5C or older iPhones.",Case makes iPhone a BlackBerry clone | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/09/case-makes-iphone-a-blackberry-clone/

Two days after being booted from an AT&T party at the Consumer Electronics Show here, T-Mobileís colorful chief exec delivered a lively, profanity-laced talk that bashed his rivals as much as it pumped his own brand. As expected, much of it centered on contracts ó the linchpin of T-Mobileís recent marketing efforts. ìWe are either going to take over this whole industry Ö or these bastards are going to change,î Legere told a packed audience at the Venetian Hotel. ìEither way, it doesnít make a god-damned difference to me.î Pacing the stage with a can of Red Bull in hand, Legere smiled and said: ìI am going to love watching the peckers scream and cry.î It was a riveting performance even for Legere, who has been working to position T-Mobile over the last year as the ìuncarrierî network. To do this, T-Mobile has lined up initiatives designed to draw customers away from rivals, including plans that let people upgrade at any time. At the event, Legere upped the ante by promising to pay as much as $350 in early termination fees AT&T, Sprint or Verizon charge customers jumping to T-Mobile.

The year in tweets brought us some Twitter-only phenomena: your ìSharknadoísî, your ìSound of Music Liveísî; any number of social media-perpetuated hoaxes (Diane in 7A, we hardly knew ye); and, of course, a never-ending stream of celebrity meltdowns and feuds. Out of the millions of tweets spewed out in 2013, here are our 10 favorites: 1. Rashida Jones ì#stopactinglikewhoresî This week's celeb news takeaway: she who comes closest to showing the actual inside of her vagina is most popular. #stopactinglikewhores ó Rashida Jones (@iamrashidajones) October 19, 2013. The ìParks and Recreationî star jumped into the controversy over twerking and breast-baring pop stars with a rant telling girls to class it up a bit. But she kept it funny with a follow-up calling on ìall men to show me dat ass.î 2. Two Bills, one selfie. A true sign that ìselfieî was 2013ís word of the year, this tweet from Bill Clintonís personal account showed that even the worldís most powerful canít help but share their own self-portraits. This one also left Twitter wondering whether Clinton understood where the two people, one thing reference comes from. 3. BurlingtonCoatFactory makes #coats cool. So many parody Twitter accounts scrape the bottom of the awful barrel (looking at you, @BilldeBleezy [https://twitter.com/BilldeBleezy]), but this fake Burlington Coat Factory account won us over for its sheer absurdity. You will never think of #coats in the same way again. 4. Amanda Bynes doesnít understand what ugly means. Easily the top pick for hottest Twitter mess of the year, former child star Amanda Bynes went fully off the rails in 2013, tweeting such gems as ìI want Drake to murder my vaginaî in between throwing bongs out of windows. But this one perhaps most represents her psychosis, when she somehow decided to lash out at the most attractive first couple in recent history with an attempt at ugly shaming, which is even funnier coming from someone with pierced cheeks. Rob Delaney continues his Twitter domination. The funniest man on Twitter had a banner year, releasing his hilarious book about alcoholism, family and personal struggle, and continuing to kill it with the tweets. This one, which came in the wake of scandals involving horse meat found in food at Ikea and elsewhere, shows what kind of man he really is. 6. Miley vs. Sinead. The twerking girl with an apparently unretractable tongue mostly kept her drama off Twitter. But she couldnít resist responding to Sinead OíConnorís open letter directed at her with this screenshot, comparing the pope-ripping crooner to the bong-throwing Bynes. 7.

400,"MediBid auction site lets doctors bid for patients. Let the bidding begin! Doctors are using MediBid to find cash-only patients. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) An online marketplace where doctors can bid for medical procedures ranging from tummy tucks to hip replacements is experiencing big growth as Americans worry about rising health care costs. The site, MediBid, was launched in 2010 by Ralph Weber, who likens it to a Priceline.com for medical care. Users receive multiple bids from doctors, and typically pay up to 80% less than the uninsured rate and 50% less than the insurance-discounted price for procedures. But patients be warned: Even though doctors include their credentials, you'll still need to do your own research. Here's how it works: Doctors pay a fee ranging from $50 to $250 per year (depending on their level of activity), submit their medical license information to MediBid and create a profile with their certifications, experience and expertise. Patients, meanwhile, type in the procedure they want, and can even attach images that would help a doctor determine pricing. Each submission costs $25 or they can opt for a year-long subscription with unlimited requests that costs $4.95 a month. Then the bidding begins: Doctors submit the lowest price they're willing to accept, the services that will be included for that price and their terms and conditions. As the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare , made more headlines and medical costs continued to rise, traffic and requests to the site increased more than 20-fold during the last quarter of 2013 compared to the same quarter in 2012. Doctors have put in nearly 10,000 bids and patients have signed up for more than 2,000 procedures so far. The majority are orthopedic surgeries like hip and knee replacements, but there have also been many cosmetic surgeries and alternative treatments. For the doctor, the incentive is to cut out the administrative costs associated with taking insurance, instead allowing them to deal directly with patients who pay cash. The patient gets pricing transparency, making it easier to determine how much they are going to owe for a certain procedure ahead of time and to compare prices among doctors. But there are drawbacks: Since doctors participate voluntarily, consumers won't always have a full range of choices and may not pick the most experienced doctor, said Matthew DeCamp, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. ""Unless transparency and quality are linked, a user is not in a position to fully evaluate their options,"" said DeCamp. To vet doctors, MediBid ensures they are licensed, in good standing and not under probation, but it doesn't check in with state medical boards for complaints or make sure they are board-certified in their specialty. It also doesn't have a doctor rating system, so consumers need to do their own research -- which they can do by looking up reviews and ratings at websites like HealthGrades or ZocDoc. MediBid said it simply wants to give consumers more affordable options. And even though the majority of its users have been uninsured, Weber says he isn't threatened by the implementation of Obamacare. While Obamacare aims to provide insurance coverage for everyone and lower insurance costs for millions of Americans, some will still end up paying higher premiums and others plan to pay penalties to opt out of coverage , which could make MediBid a cheaper alternative, he said. Prices on MediBid can also cost less than an insurance-discounted rate, and procedures that aren't typically covered by insurance, like stem cell therapy, can also be found on the site. Perry Hunt, a 50-year-old from California, had been quoted more than $70,000 for a hip replacement from his local doctor, after his insurance company refused to cover it. Frustrated, he dropped his insurance plan and searched for ""cash surgeries"" online, where he found MediBid. He accepted a bid from a doctor for $21,000 after poring through reviews of the surgeon online. The surgery ended up being a huge success, and he said he was fully recovered after three weeks. Weber cautions that MediBid isn't meant to be a replacement for insurance. While it's a good alternative for planned procedures, you don't have time to request bids during an emergency like a heart attack. Will Obamacare affect health care costs? And while consumers using sites like MediBid need to do their own research and be cautious about the information they receive from doctors, Gelburd says it's exciting to see that websites are trying to tackle the issue of health care affordability. ""[MediBid] is evidence of this growing national conversation on cost transparency, which is healthy and is needed and will ultimately benefit the consumer,"" said Gelburd. ""But there's a lot of experimentation that needs to take place before the edges are rounded out ... so consumers should approach these sites with healthy curiosity, but also with a healthy amount of vigilance.""","MediBid auction site lets doctors bid for patients - Jan. 9, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/09/pf/insurance/medibid/index.html

His last rites would be performed at Chaityabhoomi in Dadar on Thursday. Senior political leaders of Maharashtra, including Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, paid rich tributes to Dhasal, who was one of the founder members of Dalit Panthers, a militant movement inspired by the Americaís Black Panthers movement. Dhasal had been wheelchair-bound because of his illness for the last few years. Born in a village in Khed taluka of Pune district on February 15, 1949, he along with his parents later shifted to Mumbai in search of livelihood. His father was in meat-selling business. Dhasal spent his early childhood in Golpitha, a red light area in Mumbai. Tiding over a personal struggle in his life, Dhasal took recourse to passionate writing on human hardships, which was unconventional and bold and baffled the world of literature in the early 1970s and 80s. ìDhasal played a crucial role in rejuvenating the militant spirit in the generation next through his Dalit Panthers movement. His hard-hitting speeches coupled with equally forceful writings gave a new direction to the Dalit writings,î says noted Dalit writer Arjun Dangle. Dhasal, a Padma Shri awardee, was often misunderstood for bringing in his writing phrases that were considered forbidden in the civil society. ìDhasalís greatest achievement was his ability to use poetry for politics. The themes he chose unravelled the hardships of humanity and their struggle was often shown in a raw manner through words, which often created a shock,î says Shiv Sena MP Bharatkumar Raut. ìDhasal was extremely well versed with international writings and political movements. He was often misunderstood within his own Dalit organisations,î Raut says. The prolific writer who continued to pen his column from the hospital bed first shot to fame with his work Golpitha (1973). It was followed by Morkh Mhataryane (Foolish old man), Tujhi Iyatta Kanchi (How educated are you?), Khel, Mi Marle Suryacharathache Saath Ghode (I killed seven horses of Sun), Tuhji Boat Dharun Mi Chalalo (I held your fingers to walk). Dhasal was committed to the Dalit Panthers movement which lost its steam in the 1990s because of internal differences. His ability to speak blunt on political developments often triggered a rage in Maharashtra. He was awarded the prestigious Soviet Land Nehru Award (1974) and Sahitya Akademi in the same year.

The relaxed rules will also apply to other infertility-related treatment such as IVF. The decision was announced through separate notifications by the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade over the last one month. To ensure quality control, such imports will have to carry a no-objection certificate from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ìIt is not only for foreign nationals but also Indian couples settled abroad if they want to bring frozen embryos to India for infertility treatment or surrogacy,î Hrishikesh Pai, president-elect of the Indian Society of Assisted Reproduction and head of the IVF unit at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, told The Indian Express. ìThis was not permitted earlier but the new guidelines have streamlined the process and cleared grey areas on their import.î Although ICMR had recognised the import of human embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen containers for artificial reproduction techniques as proper medical procedure to be conducted in India, doctors said customs and DGFT rules did not permit such imports.

The story had all the makings of a true New York City scandal: a loud-mouthed kid from Brooklyn who didnít know when to shut up, a gorgeous and wronged wife, a contentious mayoral primary and strange, perverse sex stories. 4. Edie Windsor celebrates gay marriage victories. This summer, with the whole country watching, the US Supreme Court struck down both the Defense of Marriage Act and Californiaís Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage, in a huge victory for gay rights advocates across the country. New Yorker Edie Windsor was the plaintiff in the DOMA case, and there was only one place she wanted to be: ìI wanna go to Stonewall right now!î she said after the verdict came down, referring to the Greenwich Village bar where the gay rights movement began. When she got there, hundreds of supporters cheered her on during a party that lasted all night, as the verdict serendipitously coincided with the start of NYC Pride Week. 5. Coney Islandís Astrotower comes down. Coneyís Astrotower ó one of the few remaining symbols of the amusement areaís heyday ó was finally torn down this July due to safety concerns. It was a symbolic moment not just for Coney Island itself, which has struggled to find its new identity in the wake of rezoning and new development, but also for the areaís post-Sandy recovery. While most of Coney Island got back up and running after the storm in time for the summer, the Astrotower incident happened over the Fourth of July, forcing many businesses (including the Cyclone) to remain closed over the lucrative holiday week and missing out on crucial post-Sandy revenue. 6. These savvy entrepreneurs started charging for Banksy. British street artist Banksy embarked on a residency in New York City this fall, with a new piece of art popping up each day somewhere in the five boroughs. But when he hit East New York, neighborhood residents didnít just let art tourists pass through their streets: They covered it in cardboard and charged people $20 a pop to see the piece, a stenciled beaver. Itís that only-in-New-York hustle at it again. 7. New York outreaches Chicago. The new World Trade Center building was officially named the tallest building in America in November, edging out (barely) Chicagoís Willis Tower. While the competition led to some good-natured digs from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who ridiculed the Trade Centerís vertiginous spire, the best shockwave from the news was ìThe Daily Showî host Jon Stewartís rant against Chicago-style pizza , which definitely settled the issue of why New Yorkís slices are superior. Chicago pizza, Stewart says, is ìtomato soup in a bread bowl. .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. I donít know whether to eat it, or throw a coin in it and make a wish.î 8. People waited eight hours for rain. The cityís second-longest line of the year (after the cronut, of course), fans lined up for up to eight hours this summer for a chance to walk through this interactive exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. Using motion sensors, a room let visitors walked through rain without getting wet. The huge popularity of the limited-time exhibit reminded us that culinary creations arenít the only thing New Yorkers are willing to spend their whole day in line to see. 9. Citi Bike is a hit. Despite concerns that accompanied the rollout of Citi Bike , the cityís first bike-share program, it has proved to be hugely popular (even Leonardo DiCaprio and Louis C.K. were spotted on them), with 5.5 million trips taken since the debut in May. And without the feared increase in major accidents or injuries resulting from hundreds of new cyclists on the streets, it looks like the bikes are here to stay. 10. 5 Pointz gets whitewashed. The graffiti mecca in Queens faced a fate worse than demolition this fall: While the building was slated to come down to make way for condos, the owners whitewashed the exterior overnight in November, covering up the colorful walls of the 20-year-old complex. The move was a heartbreaker for fans of graffiti art, who had still hoped to save 5 Pointz. Many considered it a sign of whatís to come in New York City, as its grittier past gets torn down in favor of glitzier condos. What was the best NYC moment of 2013? "" Citi Bike , the cityís first bike-share program, it has proved to be hugely popular"" Don't believe Sadik-Khan's b.s. Do the math: There are close to 9,000,000 people in NY.† CitiBike has 90,000 members. That is, 1% of the population. Since when does something with only a 1% following prove to be ""hugely popular"", or even ""popular""? In fact, it is so unpopular that it is losing money and is being subsidized by CitiBank. Otherwise it would FAIL. That's why there is talk the the promoters might have to ask us taxpayers to bankroll it next year.",The 10 best New York City moments of 2013 | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/12/31/the-10-best-new-york-city-moments-of-2013/
407,"Related. Senior AAP leader and Delhi Urban Development Minister Manish Sisodia Wednesday said there is a possibility that the partyís cadre could indulge in ìpolitical goondaismî and that senior leaders were ìscaredî and ìconsciousî of this. The AAP leadership, he said, would send out a strong message to volunteers indulging in such practices. Speaking at the Idea Exchange programme of The Indian Express, Sisodia, a founder-member of AAP, said the issue was very sensitive. ìI will honestly say that one path for the party is towards goondaism. Political goondaism. We have seen this a lot in India, when a political party comes to power and the partyís followers, in the name of power or the ruling party, resort to goondaism. We are very scared and we are conscious about that,î Sisodia said. According to the debutant minister, it was necessary to ensure such activities be stopped as soon as possible. ìI agree that strict action should be taken against any AAP volunteer or party member or anybody masquerading as one in an AAP cap. It is paramount that we show how serious we are about this even if it involves a close volunteer,î Sisodia said. However, Sisodia also maintained that although the party leadership was against goondaism, it was important for society to get involved. ìFor example, take the education volunteers. They have been vetted by me and are not AAP party members. I can vouch for each of them and they have no authority other than to observe and report to me of the condition of schools,î he said. The minister also said that more than a mechanism, it was important to send a message. ìWhat you do once such an incident is reported is important. If this (goondaism) comes to our notice, we will hit back and hit back hard. We will hit back so strongly that the message will go out among all our volunteers,î Sisodia said.",We know one path can lead to political goondaism: Sisodia | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/we-know-one-path-can-lead-to-political-goondaism-sisodia/

409,"The deal Congress passed to avert default and fund the government for a few months also requires lawmakers to do what they, um, were elected to do: Sit down and negotiate over a budget. Expectations for any large, long-range deal are low. And experts are not wildly optimistic lawmakers will successfully deal with shorter-term budget decisions either. ""Because the deal does not address any of the underlying policy differences between the two parties, Washington will simply barrel toward a new set of deadlines no better prepared for compromise than it was this time around,"" said Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group. The deal doesn't require anything specific of budget negotiators other than to wrap up talks by December 13, and to not use the talks as a vehicle for further debt ceiling increases. The most immediate decision: What to do about the across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester, and how to fund the government for the rest of fiscal year 2014? The deal only provides funding through mid-January. If lawmakers don't renegotiate the sequester, which is widely acknowledged to be a ham-fisted way to reduce deficits, funding will automatically be cut by an additional $19 billion on January 15 on top of the cuts already made this year. Of course, lawmakers haven't been able to agree how to replace the sequester since it was first created as a cudgel in 2011. Republicans want to lessen the cuts for defense and instead cut non-defense programs more deeply -- a nonstarter for Democrats. Democrats want higher 2014 funding levels than called for under sequestration and want to replace them with longer term budget savings from spending cuts and tax increases -- a nonstarter for Republicans. These disagreements bleed into general discussions about funding the government for 2014. If Congress fails to do so by January 15, another government shutdown will occur. More broadly, people in both parties acknowledge that tax reform and entitlement reform will help close the country's long-term shortfalls and help boost the economy over time. They just disagree vehemently about how to go about it. And here's the thing: 2014 is a midterm election year for Congress. The voting public never loves hearing that benefits may be cut and taxes increased. Nor is it clear that hardliners in either party are in a negotiating mood. Still, there's a chance something longer term comes out of the budget conference, which will be headed by Republican Paul Ryan of the House and Democrat Patty Murray of the Senate. ""I hold out some hope that a combination of tax reform and minor entitlement reforms can emerge. I have much more optimism now that it is in the hands of Ryan and Murray,"" said Steve Bell, senior director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Economic Policy Project . His colleague, William Hoagland, is also hopeful but not quite as optimistic. Maybe the committee will net some minor deficit reduction, said Hoagland, a senior vice president at the center. But he's not holding his breath. ""You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink."" Longtime budget expert Stan Collender , a former Democratic staffer in Congress, is not hopeful at all. ""They haven't done anything in two years. Why does anyone think anything can happen in a few months?"" As for the lead negotiators? Put them down as officially hopeful. ""We recognize ... the challenges we face in reaching an agreement. But we want to find common ground and work toward a bipartisan deal. We intend to focus on what we can achieve,"" Ryan and Murray said in a joint statement after the deal passed the House.","This just in: Congress votes to do its job - Oct. 17, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/17/news/economy/debt-ceiling-deal/index.html

411,"This 3D printer makes edible food. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A 3D food printer sounds like something out of Star Trek, but it's not out of this world. It's up and running at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan -- and in five years, it could be in your home. As part of a project at Cornell University, a group of scientists and students built a 3D printer and began testing it out with food. The device attaches to a computer, which works as the ""brain"" behind the technology. It doesn't look like a traditional printer; it's more like an industrial fabrication machine. Users load up the printer's syringes with raw food -- anything with a liquid consistency, like soft chocolate, will work. The ingredient-filled syringes will then ""print"" icing on a cupcake. Or it'll print something more novel (i.e., terrifying) -- like domes of turkey on a cutting board. ""You hand [the computer] three bits of info: a shape that you want, a description of how that shape can be made, and a description of how that material that you want to print with works,"" says Jeff Lipton, a Cornell grad student working on the project. Lipton is pursuing a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. The project came out of Cornell's Fab@Home venture, headed up by associate professor Hod Lipson. Started in 2005, the project aims to create do-it-yourself versions of machines that can manufacture custom objects on-demand. The group started experimenting with food fabrication in 2007. Lipton thinks food printing will be ""the killer app"" of 3D printing. Just like video games fueled demand for personal computers 30 years ago, he thinks the lure of feeding Grandma's cookie recipe into a printer will help personal fabricators expand beyond the geek crowd. ""It's really going to be the next phase of the digital revolution,"" he says. David Arnold, director of culinary technology at the French Culinary Institute, has been testing out the technology since October 2009. He loves the experimentation it makes possible. ""One of the main things I hope this machine will let us do is create new textures that we couldn't get otherwise,"" he says. ""This is the first time I've really seen this happen."" That could draw in chefs and restaurateurs. But Arnold also thinks a 3D food printer will have mass appeal. ""This would be a slam dunk for cookies at holiday time,"" he says. ""Anything that requires a high level of precision that people don't usually have with their hands, in terms of making icing or decorations, this thing can perform amazingly well."" Because it's an academic project, the 3D food printer isn't commercially available -- yet. The Fab@Home project has the blueprints for free online, and dedicated hobbyists can use them to build their own. One retailer, nextfabstore.com , offers an assembled version for sale -- starting at a mere $3,300. Entrepreneur Jamil Yosefzai plans to be on the forefront of commercializing the technology. His New York City-based startup, Essential Dynamics, is working on a version that can be sold to the first wave potential customers: pastry chefs and tech early adopters. Yosefzai thinks his version of the printer will kinetically retail for around $1,000, but he expects that price tag to eventually fall to $700 or so. And he predicts that the technology could become a household staple within a decade. ""It comes down to comfort level, and that will expand as the [technology] goes more and more into schools and everywhere else,"" he says. ""Sort of like computers -- the kids picked it up first, then the parents picked it up, and once everybody has an acclimation to it, they'll be printing left and right.""","This 3D printer makes edible food  - Jan. 24, 2011",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/24/technology/3D_food_printer/
412,"3-D printing stocks: Fad or for real? Shares of companies in the 3-D printing business have been on a tear this year. And the 3-D stocks continued to rally Tuesday despite a conservative outlook from industry leader 3D Systems . 3D Systems ( DDD ) reported record sales for the third quarter on ""unprecedented"" demand for its printers, which includes the consumer-friendly $1,300 Cube . Earnings were in-line with expectations, but the company lowered its guidance for full-year profits. Still, the stock bounced back from losses in the early morning and was up more than 1% in midday trading. Shares of competitors Stratasys, ExOne and voxeljet moved higher as well. 3D Systems CEO Avi Reichental said earnings may suffer in the short term as the company ramps up manufacturing capacity and spends more money to develop new products. He said in a statement that the company is prioritizing ""market share expansion ahead of earnings per share."" That strategy may make sense. While 3-D printing has existed on an industrial scale for decades, it has only recently become accessible for small businesses and consumers. And the business has become highly competitive. Investors have piled into 3-D printing stocks this year as the technology has been used to produce everything from action figures to medical devices. But the outlook from 3D Systems does highlight concerns about the young industry's growing pains. Printing a 3D robot. There are now four publicly-traded companies that make 3-D printers and accessories, including two that went public earlier this year. Germany's voxeljet ( VJET ) was the latest to hit the market. The company provides on-demand 3-D printing for industrial and commercial customers, among other services. Less than two weeks after its IPO, voxeljet shares have surged 140%. ExOne ( XONE ) , which makes industrial 3-D printers, has nearly doubled since its initial public offering in February. Shares of Stratasys ( SSYS ) have surged 30% this year, due in part to its acquisition of MakerBot in August. MakerBot was one of the first companies to sell desktop 3-D printers. So consumers and investors have plenty of pure play 3-D printing company to choose from ... and other tech companies are gearing up to join the fray as well.

413,"Microsoft's hybrid device is thinner, lighter, faster and has the same lovely 1080p display as the beefed-up Surface Pro 2. It is still exquisitely designed. Moving through the Windows RT interface, it feels as fast and smooth as any iPad or Android tablet . First let's look at the new covers. The Touch Cover and Type Cover are still some of the best innovations to come out of Redmond. It is amazing how thin they are and how they magnetically connect to the Surface. And this time around, the keyboards on both are much better than before. But the trackpad is still a problem with these covers. Strangely enough, the trackpad on the Type Cover is worse than both the new Touch Cover and last year's Type Cover. Besides the fact that they're too small and unresponsive for more advanced computing, they still primarily react to where you're clicking or touching the trackpad instead of responding to how many fingers you're using. Take, for example, dragging and highlighting objects. Instead of letting you swipe with three fingers on the trackpad to grab a file and drop it in a folder, select a chunk of text, or rearrange a snap widget , you have to hold one finger in the lower left hand corner and use another to move the object in question around the screen. This doesn't seem like a big problem in theory, but given the lack of size and issues with responsiveness (not to mention the lack of a mechanical click), trying to pull these actions off are a hassle. That's why people still prefer to do them on PCs. Surface screen still not ideal. When used as a tablet, the biggest issue is the screen. The 16:9 display is plenty responsive to your touch, gorgeous to look at and fine when docked to a keyboard and trackpad. But its proportions are problematic when used as a tablet. Most people tend to hold tablets vertically. When you do that with the Surface, it just feels awkward. It's too long and narrow. It's why many large Android tablets -- like the Nexus 10 and Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 -- adopt a less wide screen. Taking that one step further and going with a 3:2 display would be a happy compromise between Microsoft's current screen and the iPad's more squarish 4:3 display. But the screen issues keep the Surface from being an excellent, or even good, tablet. It's simply adequate. And that's bad news for a device that's supposed to be a tablet first and PC second. Windows 8.1 is better, but not perfect. The updated Windows RT 8.1 software for the Surface 2 has many needed improvements. The enhanced functionality of the snap widgets and integration of notifications offer a glimpse at how the Surface could help to define the future look and feel of computing. First impressions of Microsoft's Surface 2. Having Twitter or a music player permanently docked next to Internet Explorer is convenient. Stacking 4 apps next to each other in an external monitor is also nice. It makes you glad to not be using a PC with traditional windows. But even if there are lots of good theoretical ideas, Windows 8.1 still doesn't feel entirely intuitive. Too many of its advanced features are often discovered by mistake -- or in my case, by frequent Googling. Another big problem is how you interact with the hardware and software. There's no reason why users shouldn't be able to easily control every aspect of Windows with the keyboard and trackpad of the touch cover or type cover. But far too often I found myself going from using the keyboard and mouse to touching the screen in order to switch apps. This will frustrate most people. Where are the apps? Another major roadblock is the lack of RT apps. Microsoft's app store is better than it was this time last year. Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Hulu and Kindle now all providing their services in RT form. And while apps are a little less crucial on a tablet than a phone, missing official apps from the likes of Spotify and Pandora and the entire Google suite really hurts. If you buy a Surface and want the best possible experience, you have to be comfortable using Microsoft's solutions for mail, messaging, cloud storage, entertainment, and reading. Not everyone will be. Microsoft's ""fix"" for this issue is essentially the new, pricier Surface Pro 2, which runs a full version of Windows 8.1 and allows you to install all the old desktop apps you're used to. That's a problem for Microsoft. The Surface Pro 2 is fat, heavy, and has all the same issues with the display size and RT apps that the Surface 2 does. It's also a boring, unimaginative cop out for Microsoft. Microsoft must make a tough decision. The Surface 2 is the better idea and more closely resembles what computers will resemble in the future, but the Surface Pro 2 is still more functional for the time being. It seems that Microsoft is more worried about not alienating its current (but shrinking) user base than it is with winning over new customers with something more innovative. This yet again leaves Microsoft in a weird place. Microsoft either needs to start phasing out the traditional desktop environment in earnest or it needs to keep the two modes walled off from each other. In other words, have the Surface use the traditional Windows when it's docked into the keyboard cover but operate with the new interface when it's disconnected from the cover. Otherwise, devices like the Surface are going linger in a state of tech limbo. That's unfortunate. The Surface 2 is not disappointing because it's bad. It's disappointing because Microsoft has this truly great idea that hasn't yet translated into a truly great product.","Microsoft's Surface 2 still falls short of greatness - Nov. 8, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/08/technology/mobile/microsoft-surface-2-review/index.html
414,"Windows Phone 8 update supports bigger and faster phones. Windows Phone 8 update is a small update that will benefit big phones. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Count Microsoft in on the giant phone trend. When the latest Windows Phone 8 update hits devices at the end of the month, MIcrosoft's mobile operating system will get support for zippy quad-core processors and 1080p high-definition screens. That means Windows Phone devices will be able to sport five-inch, Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) iPhone-like retina-grade displays. It also means that we'll eventually see a Windows Phone phablet. The push for bigger displays also means that more live tiles can fit on the screen, and big phones running Windows Phone 8 will be able to add an extra column of tiles to its home screen. The most universal change to Windows Phone 8 is that Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) has added a multitasking interface to the operating system for quick app switching. For those who have used or seen how multitasking in iOS 7 works, Microsoft's implementation isn't all that different. Hold down the back button, and you're transitioned to a screen where each open app is represented as a card that you can tap to close. And then there are the more minor updates. It will be easier to use your phone as a wireless hotspot, allowing you to use Bluetooth to automatically set things up. You can -- finally -- lock the orientation of the screen so that it doesn't keep rotating when you're lying down. And the Windows Phone 8 update will automatically detect when you're driving, and it can automatically send replies to text messages. Microsoft says there are other tweaks and improvements, but aside from claims of improved overall performance, they're things users won't notice. The free Windows Phone update will start popping up on the first devices sometime in the next few weeks, but the time frame for which phones get it depends on which phone you have, and what carrier your signed up with.","Windows Phone 8 update supports bigger and faster phones - Oct. 14, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/14/technology/mobile/windows-phone-8-1-update/index.html
415,"Windows 8.1's little changes are a huge improvement. The Windows 8.1 update doesn't run away from last year's drastic redesign. It's doing the opposite. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Microsoft on Thursday released Windows 8.1, a vastly improved update of its forward-thinking but flawed PC operating system. On paper, the list of changes that Microsoft made to Windows 8.1 don't seem all that major. No, the app tiles aren't gone. Yes, the Start button is back, but not exactly as you remember it. But it isn't until you actually start using the latest version of Windows that you can appreciate the big benefits of little tweaks. Start button: The return of the Start button to its rightful spot on the desktop taskbar is a perfect example. The Start button's main function in Windows 8.1 is actually to call up the Start screen (the series of app tiles that Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) calls ""Modern UI,"" which was introduced in Windows 8) -- not the labyrinth of nested menus that it used to hide. But when you're in desktop mode and you click the Start button, it won't take you completely out of the desktop. Instead, a semi-transparent version of the Modern UI will float on top of the desktop, allowing you to choose an app. That feature also allows you to control how you organize the Start screen. You can quickly lump together all the icons for your desktop apps in the Modern UI and label them as such. Windows 8 says goodbye to the Start button. In other words, the new Start button brings back all the functionality of the Start button from Windows 7, but with the look and feel of the more modern Windows 8.1. Snap view: The biggest change in Windows 8.1 is the expansion of the ""snap view"" feature that enables multiple apps on the screen at the same time. Windows 8.1 will let you run up to eight apps side by side -- up from just two in Windows 8. (That's provided you have two 2560x1600 resolution monitors. On a smaller device like the Surface, you can still only have two.) Unlike Windows 8, which ran the second app in snap view as a more limited widget in a small strip of the screen, Windows 8.1 lets users decide how much space each app takes up on the screen -- half? a third? a quarter? Your call! To make Windows 8.1 users feel less locked into a single app, snap view will automatically launch in certain situations. For example, if you're reading an email and you click on a link, you will no longer exit the email app and go into the browser. Instead, the screen will automatically split itself into two (if it isn't already), and Internet Explorer will pop up right next to your email app. You can even rearrange panes and drag and drop files between them as easily as you would two windows in desktop mode. App improvements: Microsoft has put in a lot of work into more tightly integrating its own services throughout Windows 8.1. For example, if you search for a musician using the Bing search app, links and play buttons to that artist's songs and albums will be integrated into the results. When you receive a Skype call and your computer is locked, you will be able to answer the call without having to first unlock your computer. And most importantly, the SkyDrive cloud storage service will be more tightly woven into Windows 8.1. SkyDrive won't just make your cloud files look and feel native inside Windows, but it will also sync all your Windows and app settings on the fly, so that you don't have to reconfigure every Windows 8.1 device you use. When you have more than one monitor, for instance, Windows 8.1 will make sure you can independently adjust scaling for each one so that text, icons and other visual elements are optimally sized and proportioned on each display. (This was a major problem when using the Surface Pro with an external monitor.) Another tiny fix that goes a long way is how the Start Screen organization process has been cleaned up. Being able to name groups of tiles gives the screen an added sense of order. Instead of pinning every newly installed app to the Start Screen, Windows 8.1 now just adds new apps to a larger list of apps one menu level below. That helps cut down on the chaos of the Start Screen, making it just about the apps that matter to the user. And having the ability to move entire groups of tiles at once -- as opposed to one by one -- eliminates a tedious process of personalizing the Start Screen. No going back to the drawing board: Before Microsoft first pulled the cover off of Windows 8.1 in May, there were claims that negative feedback and poor sales of Windows 8 had forced the company to rethink its strategy and largely abandon its futuristic overhaul of Windows. That couldn't be further from the truth. With Windows 8.1, Microsoft is slowly pushing us deeper into its Modern UI. Many of the new tweaks to Windows exist to make the Modern UI more enticing as the primary mode of computing. Microsoft's execution of its PC/tablet hybrid operating system concept still isn't flawless, but its patience in adhering to its vision is commendable. By addressing some of Windows 8's more problematic aspects with subtle, iterative improvements, Microsoft is slowly transitioning its user base to this radical new mode of computing. That not only makes Windows 8.1 a promising upgrade, but it may go a long way towards validating Microsoft's somewhat risky strategy.","Windows 8.1's little changes are a huge improvement - Oct. 17, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/17/technology/enterprise/windows-8-1/index.html
416,"Xbox One: A $499 PC for your living room. The Xbox One is Microsoft's first new gaming console in eight years. It's a quality piece of hardware but it's also noteworthy because Microsoft is using it to make a statement. Video game consoles are no longer just gaming consoles. They're computers for your living room. So how does the Xbox One, which goes on sale for $499 on Friday, fare with that in mind? Hardware: The Xbox hardware is big ... even by next-generation console standards. It's bigger than a cable box and Blu-ray player, but thankfully smaller than an AV Receiver. That said, the Xbox One is tastefully designed, which makes its size less of an issue. The combination of finishes, textures and angles make the all-black box fun, but not loud. You won't have to hide this away from public sight. On the inside, the Xbox is now powered by the same developer-friendly 8-core processor as Sony's PlayStation 4. It also has 8 gigabytes of RAM, but its approach to using these components is very different from its competitor. Instead of letting developers access the full power of the system, Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) partitioned off a chunk of the system resources so they can only be accessed by apps and entertainment content. Conversely, those apps can never access the part of the processor devoted to games. This is done mostly to ensure that apps and services can run continuously in the background with little to no effect on the game. But it's also an acknowledgment that these devices are evolving past their primary function as gaming machines. Controller : The Xbox One controller isn't radically changed from the Xbox 360's, but there are enough changes to warrant calling it the best Xbox controller yet. Though the controller is more angular in appearance to match the console itself, it's every bit as comfortable to hold as its predecessor. The joysticks have a deeper concave well for thumbs and a grippy ring around the edge to lessen the chances of finger slippage. The rear triggers and shoulder buttons are bigger and more accommodating of different ways gamers may hold controllers. They also have vibration motors built into each button, which adds a more realistic dimension to certain games. And the D-pad has been redesigned, eschewing the mushy-feeling circle for the more traditional, clicker cross. All of these improvements should make first-person shooter and fighting game fans happy. Graphics/Performance: Are the graphics improved over last generation? Yes. But is that improvement as immediately noticeable? Not necessarily. A quick glance at the Xbox launch titles may indicate that graphics haven't made a huge leap forward. Still, the overall visual experience feels heightened. The added processing power now allows for more things to happen on screen at once. You can be battling your way through a game with hundreds of objects and characters on screen, and it will look and feel as smooth as the best titles on the Xbox 360. The lighting effects, such as the sun shining through clouds or candlelight reflecting off metal, are noticeably better than before. That goes a long way towards making the games feel more realistic. And little details, like the body movements of characters and the expressions in their faces as they speak, are starting to look more natural. All of this adds up to a more cinematic experience. UI/Apps: Last year's update to the Xbox 360 adopted some of the design from Windows 8 and Windows Phone. The Xbox One interface is now fully assimilated into that world: it is all about brightly-colored tiles. In many ways that's for the better. You can pin your favorite apps and games to the console's dashboard. But you can also do that for favorite albums and TV shows to allow quick access to things you regularly consume. Snap apps are another big plus. Like Windows 8, the Xbox will let you to take up a quarter of the screen with a second app in the form of a widget. This can give you quick access to controls in the Xbox music app or score updates from the NFL app. If you have a special form of ADD, you can play a game and watch TV at the same time. This is a feature loaded with potential, especially when it comes to Internet Explorer. Microsoft's browser can recognize and load more mobile-optimized version of sites when you have it snapped. But if people started creating versions of their sites optimized for this snap mode, it could change the way people consume web pages on their TV. Many of the initial launch apps still weren't available at the time of this review though. So it's hard to say how offerings like Netflix, Hulu and ESPN fare on the new console. But Microsoft's own apps did show plenty of promise. OneGuide : In addition to delivering entertainment via apps, the Xbox One also allows itself to be a conduit for your cable TV. By plugging your set-top box into the Xbox, you can access normal TV without having to switch inputs. You can also control the essential functions of your TV, cable box or other components such as volume and changing channels. Microsoft also created OneGuide to improve the process of TV navigation. It doesn't do anything radically different as far as predicting what you want to watch, but it looks nicer and feels more responsive than most boxes -- which are usually terrible. One guide will also allow you to use voice commands to search for channels by name. It will also let you add in streaming video apps as ""channels."" But if you don't want to use the Xbox guide, it's still perfectly possible to just use your existing remote and set-top box guide through the Xbox. The biggest takeaway from OneGuide is that, combined with the games, streaming video and music apps and Blu-ray player, it's possible to use your Xbox for every facet of living room entertainment. Voice Commands : Speaking of voice commands, one of the biggest selling points of the Xbox One is that you can tell it do whatever you want instead of using a remote or a game controller. You can turn the console on using your voice. You can launch an app. You can snap an app. You can switch between apps. You can launch internet searches with Bing. But for now, it's very much a work in progress. Any given voice command worked about as much as it didn't work. And unlike what Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) is doing with its Now service, or even Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) with Siri, the Xbox One's voice command requires very specific commands. You have to state the full name of games. You have to use the precise jargon to trigger an action. Your speech has to be clear and properly cadenced. All of these variables make for an experience that requires more effort than just using the controller. But when you do get it to work, it's easy to see how powerful it could be if Microsoft improves on it in the future. Kinect : The Kinect hardware is definitely better, but it's still hard to say what that means for the experience on Xbox. None of the games provided with the review unit made a compelling case for Kinect, though a couple of upcoming titles like ""The Fighter Within"" may change that soon. Using connect to control your Xbox with your hand doesn't feel much better or worse than it did with the 360, which is to say that it's still gimmicky. One of the best uses for Kinect is Skype calling, which turns your living room into some sort of George Jetson visage of the future. But what really stands is that the Kinect camera will follow you as you move around the room. That's very cool. Xbox Fitness also takes advantage of the Kinect to good effect, tracking your movements and showing what muscles you're using as you make your way through a workout video. But Kinect still needs a major hit -- and not a collection of half-baked mini games -- to really showcase its potential. Verdict: The Xbox has some kinks to work out with its system software, voice recognition and Kinect camera. It will also take a while for the truly great games to arrive. But Microsoft has produced a console that is worth the money now, and will really be worth it down the road as long as you're fine with their overarching philosophy that these devices are now living room PCs.","Xbox One: A $499 PC for your living room - Nov. 20, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/20/technology/xbox-one-review/index.html

Prevailing thought says that 360-degree feedback and performance appraisals should not be linked. If it is linked to compensation decisions, it may lose its power as a tool for development. The thinking is that when compensation is the outcome, individuals will quickly learn how to play the game of ""I'll scratch your back, if you scratch mine."" Further, if people do not get satisfactory ratings, morale can decrease when 360 is linked to performance appraisal mode.

418,"Definition of '3rd Party Insurance' Motor third-party insurance or third-party liability cover is a statutory requirement under the Motor Vehicles Act. Definition: Motor third-party insurance or third-party liability cover, which is sometimes also referred to as the 'act only' cover, is a statutory requirement under the Motor Vehicles Act. It is referred to as a 'third-party' cover since the beneficiary of the policy is someone other than the two parties involved in the contract (the car owner and the insurance company). The policy does not provide any benefit to the insured. However, it covers the insured's legal liability for death/disability of third-party loss or damage to third-party property. Description: Since the third-party insurance cover is mandatory, all non-life insurance companies have an obligation to provide this cover. In the Indian context, automobile dealers arrange for a comprehensive insurance cover along with vehicle registration. This comprehensive cover is an add-on to the mandatory third party cover and protects the car owner from financial losses, caused by damage or theft of the vehicle. The cost of a comprehensive cover is several times that of a stand-alone third-party cover, since damage claims are more frequent than third-party claims. Until now, the premium for motor third-party insurance was calculated on the basis of a schedule of rates provided by the Tariff Advisory Committee, an arm of IRDA, the insurance regulator. But IRDA has done away with the motor tariff. The compensation to the victim is largely decided by the earning capacity of the accident victim.",3rd Party Insurance Definition | 3rd Party Insurance Meaning - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/3rd-party-insurance
419,"Nearing retirement, with 3 tuition bills to pay. The Keunings imagine a retirement filled with kayaking -- if they can get there. (Money Magazine) At 59 and 60, Kim and John Keuning are closing in on retirement -- but they aren't quite ready for it. Six years out from their target date, the Duluth, Minn., duo have roughly $500,000 saved. Selling the small ad agency they own could net them another $150,000, they figure. (None of their five grown children is interested in taking it over.) ""We know we spend a lot on them, but it's something we want to do,"" Kim says. ""So how do we do that and everything else?"" Three fixes. Mortgage the plastic . The average rate on Kim and John's plastic is 15%. To pay off the cards, Indianapolis financial planner Michael Kalscheur suggests they take out a $40,000 30-year mortgage on their paid-off vacation cabin. At 4%, the loan would cost about $200 a month vs. their current payment of $1,300. They plan to sell the cabin just before retirement, and when they do they can use the proceeds to pay the rest of the mortgage. Redirect the payments. In the meantime, they can use the extra $1,100 in monthly cash flow to pay off their car loans. Once that $10,000 debt is wiped out, they'll have $1,600 a month to build their emergency fund. Kalscheur wants them to have at least $20,000. When this is complete, in about nine months, they should max out their Simple IRAs (in 2013, they can each put in $14,500). Assess income needs. Following this plan, Kim and John will have almost $1.6 million in six years, after selling the business, office, and cabin. That will allow them to retire with about 72% of their income. How to cut off the kids. If they want more room in their budget -- to, say, escape Minnesota's winters -- they'll have to work a little longer. Or they can beef up the business to sell it for more by nixing debt, locking clients into contracts, and recruiting employees who'll be indispensable to the next owner, Kalscheur says.","Nearing retirement, with 3 tuition bills to pay - Aug. 7, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/01/retirement/tuition-bills.moneymag/index.html
420,"$800,000 saved, dreams of breeding horses. Bobbie and Mike Jackson, both 66, dream of turning their land in Tennessee into a horse farm that serves special-needs children. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) Growing up in Kentucky, Bobbie Jackson vividly recalls when her family got their first horse. It was an older brother's 16th birthday, and for his present he chose not a car but a steed. Ever since then she's loved all things equine. ""Horses are such majestic animals,"" she says. ""The fact that I can interact with them just thrills me."" Where they stand. Assets. IRAs. $522,000. Home value. $250,000. CDs. $181,300. Brokerage accounts. $107,000. Cash. $71,000. Antique cars/farm equipment. $50,000. Total assets. $1,181,300. Total liabilities. $0. So when she and her husband, Mike, moved in 2007 from St. Louis to a family home he inherited on 150 acres in Tennessee, Bobbie's first thought was raising horses. Having worked with autistic children in schools and respite centers, she got the idea to offer free therapy rides and to sell horses to families with special-needs kids. As for Mike, a retired engineer, he's interested because his wife is: ""I've got plenty of reasons to get up in the morning already, but it is fun to see Bobbie happy."" The Jacksons have two mares (one a miniature) they wish to breed, and also want to buy three foals. They expect to need a barn for hay storage and a run-in-shelter for the horses. Plus, they want to update the farmhouse they call home. With $800,000 in savings and an income of $93,000 from a pension, Social Security, dividends, and interest, the couple are well positioned for a comfortable retirement. But they're worried about whether they can also execute their horse farm and renovation plans without a hitch. ""I don't require a certain income from the business,"" says Mike, ""but I'd like to earn enough to more than offset expenses."" THE REALITY. Making a profit will be tougher than Mike thinks. Starting up will take some investment: The biggest cost will be the hay barn and run-in shelter, which prefab farm structure company Watson Metals in Manchester, Tenn., puts at $15,000 to $25,000. The kinds of horses Bobbie and Mike are looking for -- mixed breeds -- are cheap right now, selling for 30% less than they had been before the recession, says Nona Garson, head of the InterContinental Sport Horse Auction. So the couple should be able to pick up foals for less than $500 apiece. Additionally, to get specialty insurance needed to cover liability risks involved in hosting therapeutic riding, they first need to get certified in equine-assisted therapy, which costs $1,000 per person and can take six months to a year. Where the Jacksons will really take a hit is in the cost of running the business. They'll lay out about $2,500 a year per animal for food, vet bills, and hoof care. Farm insurance adds another $2,000 a year -- though it includes homeowners coverage, which they already pay. 'I quit banking to make ice cream' The Jacksons are currently maintaining two horses, so three foals and insurance premiums will add about $10,000 to their expenses. They can probably find a stud for the horses for about $500, says Rebecca Smith, a breeder in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. But caring for a pregnant mare during its 11-month gestation tacks on another $1,000 to $2,000. Then foals typically require at least nine months of weaning and training before they can be sold. Since the Jacksons don't plan to charge for the therapy rides -- ""How can I not help these children?"" says Bobbie -- they won't see revenue for some time. Even then, it won't be much: A good market for buying horses is a bad market for selling them. And the universe of families looking to own a horse for a special-needs child is probably quite small. All told, while Mike was aiming for a small profit, he's more likely looking at tens of thousands in losses each year, for quite a few years. As for the renovation costs, Bobbie and Mike figure their home upgrades will run $65,000. THE PLAN. ""They can still do this -- as long as they're willing to put limits in place,"" says Grove City, Ohio, financial planner Jo Anne Paynter (herself a rider). Here's how: Fund the business out of income. The Jacksons spend a lot less than they bring in each year. Mike estimates that they have an average surplus of $22,000. Keeping their horse expenses below that would allow the couple to run the business without dipping into savings -- which will in turn help them preserve the income they'll need for the business, says Paynter. Their wiggle room will get smaller as they add animals. But Mike and Bobbie can decide each year whether to expand based on their anticipated cash flow (which will go up once they start taking required minimum distributions from retirement accounts). Determine whether it's a labor of love. The Jacksons should think hard about whether they want to proceed with their dream as is, even if they won't break even. They might consider whether there's anything else they'd want to do with the money they'll spend on horses; they should also create a business plan. To increase their revenue potential, they could charge a fee for the rides to cover their costs or expand the market for the kid-friendly horses they'll breed to 4-H and pony clubs and the like. Pay for renovations out of cash. Assuming they keep the cost of the farm buildings and upgrades to their home to $90,000 or less, the Jacksons can use their savings for those purposes without compromising their income potential, says Paynter. They should draw from the $250,000 they have in bank accounts. Protect their assets. Besides getting insurance -- a must -- they should incorporate their business, a legal process that should cost less than $500. ""This would further insulate them from liability,"" says New Hope, Pa., financial planner Mark Kelly. If they are sued, for instance, their personal assets wouldn't be at risk. So far none of the hurdles have shaken Bobbie; rather; she's fortified by having a plan. Says Mike: ""She's already laying out cross fencing for me to do!""","$800,000 saved, dreams of breeding horses - Jul. 9, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/09/pf/horse-breeding.moneymag/index.html

422,"Our dream: Run a $750,000 hotel in Costa Rica. Yessenia Cruz and Roberto Garcia, of Staten Island, N.Y., stash nearly $30,000 of their $202,000 annual income, putting them on track to have $2 million by age 55. NEW YORK (Money Magazine) Yessenia Cruz has dreamed of returning to Costa Rica ever since visiting there 15 years ago. This time she isn't looking for R&R. She and her husband, Roberto Garcia, want to relocate there at 55 to open a casita -style hotel by the beach. Both say they'll be ready to leave their corporate careers -- she's a project manager; he's an architect -- and the fast pace of the Big Apple. ""We love what we do but want a more balanced life,"" says Yessenia. Where they stand. Assets. 401(k)s. $450,000. Home value. $320,000. Cash. $196,000. IRAs. $125,000. Brokerage account. $10,800. College 529. $7,000. Total assets. $1,108,800. Liabililities. Mortgage. $240,000. Total liabilities. $240,000. Though Roberto has never been to Costa Rica, he's just as excited: ""I love what the city offers, but I love nature too."" At the same time they worry about whether packing for paradise will compromise their retirement security or put the college education of their 4-year-old son, Nathaniel, at risk. THE REALITY. Since they want to be what the industry calls ""lifestyle innkeepers"" -- who open seasonally or settle for lower occupancy so that they can enjoy downtime -- they can't count on much income from the hotel. That means that in the next 15 years they're going to have to save for a long retirement while also amassing money to buy the business and pay fully for Nathaniel's tuition at a private college, as they'd like. On the first goal, at least, Yessenia and Roberto are looking good. They stash nearly $30,000 of their $202,000 annual income, putting them on track to have $2 million by age 55, says Colorado Springs financial planner Jane Young. Using a 4% withdrawal rate, they can take out $80,000 the first year, and adjust for inflation subsequently, for a very small chance of their money running out. That income will exceed their needs, since Costa Rica's cost of living is about half that of the U.S. With plans to live at their inn, Yessenia and Roberto should do very well on $36,000 a year in today's dollars ($53,000 by the time they retire), says Jason Holland, Costa Rica editor for InternationalLiving.com , a site focused on how to live, work, and retire overseas. They'll need a nest egg that size should they ever move back to the U.S., plus it gives them a margin of error on the hotel. A greater challenge will be saving another $1.2 million to use for the hotel (which will cost about $750,000 by the time they retire, Holland says) and Nathaniel's education ($430,000, according to Young). They also have a sharp learning curve ahead. As fluent Spanish speakers -- Yessenia grew up in Puerto Rico, and Roberto's family is from the Dominican Republic -- they have some advantages over other expat entrepreneurs. But neither has experience in hospitality or running a business. THE PLAN. ""If they keep up a steady savings pace, Roberto and Yessenia can make this work,"" Young says. Here's how: Get cracking on college. They now sock away $800 a month for Nathaniel's schooling; they'll need to up it to $1,250. Young advises putting two-thirds into a 529 college plan and the rest in a mutual fund that's 70% stocks and 30% bonds to give the couple flexibility to tap some of the money if needed. When Nathaniel turns 13, they should dial back the stock stake. Insurance exec finds a spicier career. Start a hotel fund. The couple have $200,000 in cash for emergencies, almost double what they need. Young advises putting $85,000 of this into a 70% stocks-30% bonds mutual fund as seed money for the inn, adding $270 a month, plus half of Yessenia's annual bonus (up to 10% of salary). Five years before moving, they should shift the funds to cash and short-term bonds. Use the house for the balance. Roberto and Yessenia should refinance their 4.5% 30-year mortgage, which has a $240,000 balance, to a 15-year loan to build equity faster, Young says. At a 2.9% rate, their payment would be just $167 more, and if their home appreciates 3% a year, they'll net $400,000 at 55 to put toward the inn. Get educated. To improve their odds of success, they should get training in hotel operations and hospitality through a group like the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (paii.org). Also, they can get hands-on practice running an inn by filling in for owners who are on vacation via the Interim Innkeeper program (inncaring.com; $750 per couple). Start shopping. The family should visit Costa Rica ASAP to ensure that Roberto is really onboard with moving. Five years out, they should start taking scouting trips to investigate locations and talk to local hotel owners, says Holland. Once they settle on an area, they can hire a broker to find turnkey operations. ""Buying an existing hotel with a website, listings in guidebooks, and maybe even guests on the books will give them an easier start,"" says Jay Karen, CEO of the PAII. Plan an exit strategy. ""Will you close the inn in five years, or do you want to sell it for a profit?"" asks Karen. The answer, he says, will drive how they run the business: To attract buyers, they'll need to be able to ""show consistent occupancy rates and profitability."" For now, Yessenia and Roberto are focused on the entrance plan. As she says, ""This confirms that Costa Rica isn't just a fantasy.""","Our dream: Run a $750,000 hotel in Costa Rica - Jul. 9, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/09/pf/dream-hotel.moneymag/index.html
423,"Members of Congress haven't been playing with a full deck for several years now when it comes to the budget. But they still managed to come up with some seriously bizarre moves on the fiscal front in 2013. 1. How would you reform the tax code? We won't tell ... for decades. No lawmaker wants to go on the record with a politically unpopular proposal ahead of a long, complicated negotiation. But keeping such proposals confidential for 50 years -- longer than presidential records are sealed? Seems a smidge much. Yet that's just the cone of silence the Senate Finance Committee offered senators who agreed to lay out their favorite tax breaks. Of course, the way things are going on Capitol Hill, tax reform may not actually get under way until December 31, 2064 anyway. 2. Stand up and be counted on the debt ceiling? Um, no thanks. Raising the debt ceiling is a necessary evil if lawmakers want to make good on their spending commitments and don't want the country to default on its debt. But it's also become a politically toxic vote . So Congress has found clever, convoluted ways to effectively raise the nation's borrowing limit without actually publicly approving an increase. Twice this year lawmakers agreed to temporarily ""suspend"" the debt ceiling. Doing so allows the Treasury Department to continue borrowing to pay the country's bills, thereby averting default. Then, when the suspension ends, the debt limit is reset to the old cap plus whatever Treasury borrowed during the suspension period. The forced budget cuts known as the sequester -- widely derided as a dumb way to cut deficits -- were supposed to hit thousands of programs, projects and activities equally. That is, until they actually went into effect. The furlough of 15,000 air traffic controllers caused all sorts of hairy delays at airports, public uproar and plenty of media coverage. So lawmakers did an about-face and loosened up the funding rules so that the furloughs could be canceled. But they left in place most of the rest of the sequester, much to the anger of those most directly affected by it. 4. Shut the government when you don't get what you want. Then reopen it after not getting what you want. A band of conservatives in the House and Senate, egged on by outside groups and ignoring advice from many in the Republican Party, forced a 16-day partial government shutdown in October. Why? They insisted that Obamacare be repealed. And if it couldn't be repealed, they wanted it delayed. Neither was ever going to happen. That was clear to everyone, including those pushing the shutdown strategy. Yet they persisted. As a result, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed, taxpayers inconvenienced, federal projects and services delayed , and fellow lawmakers from both parties outraged. To boot, Congress in the end also voted to pay federal workers who'd been furloughed for the time off, since they did nothing to cause the shutdown. That may have been the right thing to do by the workers -- who shouldn't have had to pay for political grandstanding. But let's not pretend the whole exercise wasn't a waste of taxpayer money ... and patience. 5. Oh, look! Congress votes to do its job. The deal Congress finally passed to re-open the government also required lawmakers to do what they, um, were elected to do: Negotiate a budget. Setting the lowest of expectations, the chosen negotiators cobbled together a deal that will help prevent budget standoffs for at least another year and a half and replace part of the sequester for 2014 and 2015. That's better than nothing, but not by that much. The deal would still leave in place the majority of the sequester , doesn't move the needle on entitlement or tax reform and leaves open the possibility for another debt ceiling fight this winter, something the negotiators were prohibited from considering in their deliberations.","2013's most bizarre budget moments - Dec. 20, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/20/news/economy/budget-congress/index.html
424,"The never-ending charade of debt ceiling fights. Lawmakers are tied up in knots over increasing the debt ceiling this fall. But they eventually will. The only question is how messy the process will be. Why assume they'll raise it? Because they have no real choice if they want to avoid a U.S. default. A default would hurt the economy and markets, and most lawmakers know this. That's why they regularly raise the debt ceiling before it comes to that. In fact, since 1940, Congress has effectively approved 79 increases to the debt ceiling. That's an average of more than one a year. How do they raise it? Sometimes lawmakers have raised it by small amounts, other times by large amounts. And sometimes they've raised it ""temporarily"" with provisions for a ""snap-back"" to a lower level. Since it's a politically tough vote, they occasionally devise clever ways to tacitly approve increases without ever having to publicly record a ""yes"" vote. For example, as part of the deal to resolve the 2011 debt ceiling war , Congress approved a plan that let President Obama raise the debt limit three times unless both the House and Senate passed a ""joint resolution of disapproval."" Such a measure never materialized. And even if it had, the president could have vetoed it. Under this scheme, Treasury was able to continue borrowing to pay the country's bills until May 19. At that point, the debt limit automatically reset to the old cap plus whatever Treasury borrowed during the suspension period. What does raising the debt ceiling accomplish? Despite some politicians' incorrect assertions, raising the debt ceiling does not give the government a ""license to spend more."" It simply lets Treasury borrow the money it needs to pay all U.S. bills in full and on time. Those bills are for services already performed and entitlement benefits already approved by Congress. In other words, it's a license to pay the bills the country incurs as a result of past decisions made by lawmakers from both parties over the years. Refusing to raise the debt ceiling is ""not like cutting up your credit cards. It's like cutting up your credit card bills,"" said historian Joseph Thorndike, who has written about past debt crises . How high is it today? The debt ceiling was reset at $16.699 trillion on May 19, up from the $16.394 trillion where it was before the suspension. Since then, Treasury has been forced to use ""extraordinary measures"" to keep the country from breaching the limit. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said those measures will be exhausted by mid-October , after which he will only have $50 billion on hand, plus incoming revenue to pay what's owed. Sounds like a lot, but it won't last long. How long will it last? An analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that the Treasury will no longer be able to pay all bills in full and on time at some point between Oct. 18 and Nov. 5. So, you're saying they only have a few weeks to work this out? Yup. House Republicans say they will demand spending cuts and fiscal reforms in exchange for their support of a debt ceiling increase. The White House, meanwhile, has said it won't negotiate quid pro quos. The question is when will Republicans or the White House -- or both - bend in the standoff? If recent history is any guide it likely will be just in the nick of time. And there's no telling how creative the deal they cut will be. But any bad blood created along the way almost certainly would poison other budget negotiations.","Never-ending charade of debt ceiling fights - Sep. 12, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/12/news/economy/debt-ceiling/index.html
425,"What the next debt ceiling fight will look like. Key Republicans Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have signaled that their party will insist on a quid pro quo before raising the debt ceiling again. Just what exactly isn't clear. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week that Republicans will demand something in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling early next year. The White House, meanwhile, said it won't negotiate on the issue. The country now has had extensive experience with debt ceiling brinksmanship over the past three years -- as recently as October. While no two standoffs are exactly alike, budget analysts and political observers expect this next round of see-who-blinks-first to be tamer than hot rhetoric may suggest in the weeks ahead. For starters, 2014 is a mid-term election year and Republicans realize it was a political mistake this fall to shut down the government and risk default. ""It is hard to imagine they would risk [being] blamed for a default scare in an election year,"" said Sean West, US policy director at the Eurasia Group, in a research note. Second, lawmakers have twice in the past year opted for an easy out -- a debt ceiling suspension -- when they failed to hammer out a real agreement over an increase in the borrowing limit. A suspension doesn't technically raise the debt ceiling, but lets the Treasury Department keep borrowing as needed to pay the country's bills, thereby averting default on U.S. obligations. And it doesn't force lawmakers to go on the record as voting for an increase. ""The odds favor a clean repeat of what we did last time,"" said Pete Davis, a former Capitol Hill staffer and founder of Davis Capital Investment Ideas. The last two debt suspensions were only a few months long. If Congress opts for a third, it is likely to last much longer since neither Republicans nor Democrats will want to revisit the debt ceiling issue too close to the November elections, Davis said. Another reason this time may be different -- yes, famous last words -- is because Republicans haven't really organized a strategy around the issue yet. ""Several clients have asked us what the Republicans will demand for raising the debt ceiling. Our answer: we have no idea and neither do they,"" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist of the Potomac Research Group, in a morning note Wednesday morning. In the past, House Speaker John Boehner and other key Republicans have signaled months in advance of the debt ceiling boiling point their exact demands in exchange for a debt ceiling agreement. This time around, the first real mention of demands came this past weekend, when Ryan said Republicans would gather after the Christmas break ""and discuss exactly what it is we're going to try and get."" That's not a lot of lead time. The current debt ceiling suspension ends February 7. After that, Treasury will be able to keep paying bills in full by using special accounting maneuvers known as ""extraordinary measures."" It's hard to predict exactly when those measures would run dry. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Thursday alerted lawmakers that he currently estimates the measures wouldn't last past late February or early March 2014. ""[W]e do not foresee any reasonable scenario in which the extraordinary measures would last for an extended period of time -- principally because the government experiences large net cash outflows in February and March due to tax refunds,"" Lew wrote in a letter to Congress. An earlier analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated the measures would be exhausted as early as March or as late as June.","What the next debt ceiling fight will look like - Dec. 19, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/19/news/economy/debt-ceiling/index.html
426,"WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla. ó A 71-year-old retired police officer accused of shooting a man dead in a Florida movie theater told authorities that ìhe was in fear of being attackedî during Mondayís confrontation. Curtis Reeves is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 43-year-old Chad Oulson. Reevesí first court appearance is scheduled for 1 p.m. Tuesday. Pasco County Sheriffís officials say Reeves initially asked Oulson to stop texting at the theater in Wesley Chapel, a suburb about a half-hour north of downtown Tampa. Nicole and Chad Oulson Photo: Facebook. Sheriffís Detective Allen Proctor wrote that Reeves spoke to Oulson during the movie previews, then got up from his seat and informed management. When Reeves returned to his seat ìadditional words were exchangedî and Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, the report said. After officers read him his rights, Reeves told the detective that Oulson struck him in the face with an unknown object, and thatís when he removed a .380 caliber gun from his pants pocket. The report said Reeves fired the gun and struck Oulson once in the chest and that he ìwas in fear of being attacked.î Oulsonís wife, who was also in the theater, had put her hand on her husbandís chest prior to the shooting in an attempt to shield him. Officials say she was also struck by the bullet. There were about 25 people in the theater at the time of the shooting, witnesses and authorities said. The movie playing was ìLone Survivor,î about Navy SEALS in Afghanistan. ìI canít believe people would bring a pistol, a gun, to a movie,î said Charles Cummings, who was sitting near Oulson and Reeves. ìI canít believe they would argue and fight and shoot one another over popcorn. Over a cellphone.î Cummings, who said he was a combat Marine in Vietnam, said Oulson fell onto him and his son. When they spoke to reporters on Monday, both had blood on their clothes. ìBlood started coming out of his mouth,î said Alex Cummings. ìIt was just a very bad scene.î Charles Cummings said his son went to call 911, while Cummings and another patron who was a nurse began performing CPR on the victim. The man sitting next to the suspect happened to be an off-duty deputy from another county, and he grabbed the gun out of Reevesí hand, and the suspect did not attempt to get away, Cummings said. Oulson and his wife were taken by ambulance to a Tampa-area hospital, where Chad Oulson died, said Sheriffís Office spokesman Doug Tobin. His wifeís injuries were not considered life-threatening. Tampa Police spokeswoman Laura McElroy said in a news release that Reeves was a captain when he retired from the department in 1993. She added that he was instrumental in establishing the agencyís first tactical response team. After he retired, Reeves worked security for the Busch Gardens theme park and was on the board of a neighboring countyís Crime Stoppers organization. Reevesí son also is a Tampa officer, police said.

427,"The wake-up call from the AAP that halted the BJP in its tracks in Delhi appears to have finally awakened the Sangh Parivar. For all the buzz created around the Hockey India League (HIL), the second edition is likely see fewer international names. In an unusually packed year, a calendar that features the on-going Hockey World League, the HIL, the World Cup and the Champions Trophy, most teams have to prioritise. Considering it is hard for an athlete to peak in quick succession with little time in between, most of the teams have chosen to focus on the Hockey World Cup to be held in May-June. While the HIL has a window in the hockey calendar, Germanyís head coach Markus Weiss says that the rigour of playing match after match with little time for training and even less for rest hurts players. ìIf I compare players who are training in the national camp with players playing the Euro League or even the HIL, there is a big difference,î Weiss had said. Holland coach Paul van Ass is also against the idea of losing his players to the HIL. Ahead of last yearís HIL, there was a stalemate between New Zealand players and their association after the tournamentís dates clashed with a national camp. Coach Colin Batch had then said that only players who had been part of the national camp would be considered for national selection. Ultimately the players, including captain Dean Couzins, were permitted to play in the league with Batch monitoring their progress from afar. Australia, which has 24 players signed up with the HIL, has chosen to follow a player-rotation policy while also creating a bigger pool of talent. This gives them the luxury of fielding younger players in the Hockey World League while ensuring that veterans like James Dwyer can participate in the HIL. From the German hockey team currently in India, it is only keeper Nicholas Jacobi who is likely be reprise his role with HIL team Delhi Waveriders. From the Netherlands, goalkeeper Jaap Stockman and drag flicker Sander Baart will stay on in India. Neither Germany nor Netherlands have put restrictions on their players but the Dutch say that their players have chosen to opt out. Team representatives from both Holland and Germany say that next year, with the calendar relatively relaxed, the entire contingent of players from these countries as well as those from untapped nations, such as Belgium, will mark the HIL on their calendar.","Hockey India League, not the first choice | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hockey-india-league-not-the-first-choice/
428,"What is Snapchat? Messaging service Snapchat reportedly turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook. Some view the decision to not sell out as supremely idiotic. Others see it as incredibly shrewd. The phrase ""hottest startup"" is even being thrown around. So what exactly is Snapchat? The two-year-old company founded by a group of Stanford undergrads is essentially a mobile photo and video sharing service. It is available for both iOS and Android devices and built around one central premise: anything shared on Snapchat self-destructs. It can either disappear after the recipient (or recipients) view it, or if using the new Snapchat Stories feature, it will vanish 24 hours after it's first posted. Videos range from 1-10 seconds, and photos can be viewable for that same length of time. Before sharing, users have the option of annotating clips with text and marker tools. After you send your clip out to friends, they'll see it pop up in what essentially looks like an email inbox. While it's possible to make profiles publicly accessible on Snapchat, it is the furthest thing from Facebook ( FB , Fortune 500 ) -owned Instagram in look and feel. Most people prefer to keep sharing and activity between friends, since that's likely the reason why they started using Snapchat to begin with. But given Snapchat's history, it will be curious to see if they stick with the private, ephemeral aspect as their calling card. When Snapchat first hit the iPhone App store, it was ambiguously marketed as a sexting app. But when more people started using it to share the dumb, goofy moments of their lives, the startup quickly abandoned that strategy. Teenagers hopped on the bandwagon because the self-destruct mechanism means that posts on Snapchat won't leave a mischief-filled trail of breadcrumbs for authoritarian figures to follow. And people in their 20s are gravitating towards it because people in their 20s actually go out and do stuff and have weird things to share. Or they just want everyone to know they're brushing their teeth. Though analysts are keen on the service, It's still early to say if Snapchat will join other rarefied Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, LinkedIn ( LNKD ) and Twitter ( TWTR ) or if it will fizzle out and be forgotten. But barring Facebook's failed attempt to copy the service with its Poke app, Snapchat offers something that no other major social network does. That just may be enough to tip the scales in its favor.","What is Snapchat? - Nov. 14, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/14/technology/social/snapchat-primer/
429,"J.C. Penney posts big loss, but CEO is upbeat. Expectations for J.C. Penney's second quarter were bleak. But the troubled retailer's performance was even worse than those forecasts. J.C. Penney reported a loss of $586 million, or $2.66 per share. on Tuesday. That was more than twice as bad as the $1.06 per share loss analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales declined for a ninth straight quarter, coming in at just $2.7 billion. That was down 12% from a year ago, and lower than analysts' estimates. But despite the weak performance, J.C. Penney noted that its same store sales, a key measure for retailers, were slightly better than they were during the first quarter of 2013. Sales improved each month in the second quarter, a trend the company expects to continue through the second half of the year. In particular, the Plano, Texas-based retailer said that the early weeks of the crucial back to school shopping season ""were encouraging."" However, Mike Ullman, who returned to the CEO position earlier this year following a previous seven year stint, was a bit more guarded during a conference call with analysts. He only gave vague guidance that the company expects to ""exit the [third] quarter with positive"" same store sales. ""We have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of our customers,"" said Ullman. ""To bet the ranch on a wild return to growth in a specific and short time period wouldn't be prudent."" But overall, the CEO was upbeat and hopeful, highlighting that since he returned four months ago, the company has ""moved quickly to stabilize our business - both financially and operationally - and we have made meaningful progress in important areas of the business."" That glimmer of hope boosted shares of J.C. Penney ( JCP , Fortune 500 ) after the market opened. The stock briefly dipped into the red by late morning but closed up almost 6%. Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, said that Ullman ""did a great job of selling the turnaround story."" ""They have a lot more to do, but they threw us a couple bones that confirm they're not going out of business tomorrow,"" Sozzi added.' Ullman also stressed that online sales were a ""bright spot"" last quarter, coming in higher than the first three months of the year. July online sales were up 14% compared to a year earlier, and Ullman expects ongoing improvement. The retailer also took a shot at former CEO Ron Johnson, who was ousted earlier this year in the middle of a failed attempt to turn the company around. In its earnings statement, J.C. Penney said its performance was ""negatively impacted by the company's failed prior merchandising and promotional strategies, which resulted in unusually high markdowns and clearance levels."" Johnson, a former head of Apple's retailing unit, was brought in by activist investor Bill Ackman to try and turn J.C. Penney around. But even Ackman supported the move to fire Johnson when it was clear his strategy was not working. However, Ackman grew increasingly impatient with the retailer lately and called earlier this month for the company to replace Ullman . Ackman did not get his way and abruptly quit J.C. Penney's board last week. He also reached an agreement with the retailer that will allow him to start selling his 18% stake in the company. Shares of J.C. Penney have been one of the worst performers on the stock market for the past two years. Meanwhile, the company also tried to alleviate worries about the health of its balance sheet, ending the quarter with $1.54 billion in cash, and forecasting that it would end the year with more than $1.5 billion in liquidity without having to borrow additional money. Nonetheless, Sozzi expects the company will have to borrow more in 2014.","J.C.

Penney ( JCP , Fortune 500 ) shares surged initially on the news of Johnson's departure, but pulled back on news that Ullman would replace him, and were down 7% by Monday evening. ""The choice of Mike Ullman, I think, is puzzling to a lot of people,"" said William Frohnhoefer, an analyst with BTIG, noting that Johnson's 2011 hiring was seen as an attempt to change course following Ullman's tenure. J.C. Penney shares have plunged more than 50% over the past year as Johnson, a former Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) executive who spearheaded the tech giant's retail strategy, struggled to lead a turnaround effort. Johnson announced a series of new initiatives -- including overhauled prices, redesigned store layouts, and even free haircuts fo r kids -- in an effort to revitalize the company. He ditched older brands and announced plans to to eliminate checkout counters in favor of mobile and self-checkout. The results, however, were dismal. The company has been suffering steep losses, bleeding $427 million in the fourth quarter as sales fell 28% versus a year prior. ""He tried to do too much too soon,"" Frohnhoefer said. ""He had a lot of very radical and bold ideas, and he tried to execute them all simultaneously."" Speaking to analysts in February, Johnson said the company had ""made some big mistakes, and I take personal responsibility for these."" J.C. Penney's marketing, he said, ""didn't connect very well with our customers."" Johnson received a compensation package worth $53.3 million for 2011, $52.7 million of which came in a special stock award.

Last year, hundreds of workers and thousands of supporters took part in Black Friday demonstrations in front of Wal-Mart stores across the country. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Federal officials are ready to bring a case against Wal-Mart for allegedly retaliating against workers who staged Black Friday protests last year. The National Labor Relations Board, which protects the rights of workers who organize for better working conditions, said in a statement Monday that its general counsel had found merit in several allegations against Wal-Mart. The agency said it would file a complaint if Wal-Mart and the parties could not reach a settlement. Wal-Mart, in statements on national TV and to employees at Wal-Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) stores in California and Texas, illegally threatened ""reprisal"" for workers who protested on November 22, 2012, the labor board said. The NLRB also said Wal-Mart stores in more than a dozen states ""unlawfully threatened, disciplined, and/or terminated employees"" who participated in legal strikes and protests. At the same time, the NLRB said it did not find merit in allegations that Wal-Mart had retaliated by changing work schedules, or that it interfered with workers' right to strike by telling non-employee protesters to move from Wal-Mart property. Wal-Mart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said the company will pursue its ""options to defend"" itself, noting that it takes labor laws very seriously. ""We believe our actions were legal and justified,"" Buchanan said. The finding stems from claims filed a year ago related to Black Friday strikes and protests by hundreds of workers across the country. Wal-Mart vs. the minimum wage. An advocate for Wal-Mart workers applauded the NLRB's finding. ""The board's decision confirms what Walmart workers have long known -- the company is illegally trying to silence employees who speak out for better jobs,"" said Sarita Gupta, executive director of Jobs With Justice and American Rights at Work.

If a settlement is not reached, the agency said it would file a complaint against Wal-Mart, after which a trial would be scheduled with an administrative law judge. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company is looking into its next steps and will take a decision very soon. ""We take this very seriously.

441,"Wal-Mart protests draw hundreds nationwide. Hundreds of people -- including some employees -- have taken part in Black Friday demonstrations at Wal-Mart stores nationwide, protesting what they say is the retailer's retaliation against speaking out for better pay, fair schedules and affordable health care. According to organizers from the union-backed group OUR Walmart, hundreds of workers and thousands of supporters rallied across 100 cities, including Landover Hills, Md., Miami, Oakland, Calif., Chicago, Danville, Ky., Dallas and Kenosha, Wis.

An OUR Walmart spokesman said three of those arrested were Wal-Mart workers. Those arrested were to be released without bail, unless they had previous arrest warrants. The sheriff's department said about 1,000 people arrived by bus and private vehicles to participate in the Paramount protest, which was characterized as peaceful. In Landover Hills, near Washington. D.C. ,organizers said about 350 people participated, although video of the event showed around 100 participants. Dawn Le, who works for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which backs OUR Walmart, would not say how many of those taking part were Wal-Mart employees. Wal-Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , in a statement late Friday, said worker absenteeism was down more than 60% from last year.

""Press reports are now exposing what we have said all along -- the large majority of protesters aren't even Walmart workers."" Janna Pea, an OUR Wal-Mart organizer in Dallas, said about 40 workers and about 150 supporters took part in a protest Thursday night. One of those with her was Josue Mata, who says he walked off his job as an overnight maintenance employee to protest retaliation against people who want to speak out. ""I have four kids and I don't want them to grown up in a society where people disrespect them,"" he said. ""This is a never-ending fight and we're never going to stop."" Mata said he plans to return to work for his next scheduled shift on Sunday evening. Pea said her protesters went to four Wal-Mart stores across the Dallas area, and while they were able to picket and speak to customers at half of them, they were asked to leave immediately by police at the others. ""We were still able to talk to customers and educate them about what was going on,"" she said. ""We saw one person who was planning to go shopping, but then didn't end up going in. Instead, they rallied with us."" Muhammed Malik, who helped organize a protest at a Miami Wal-Mart, said roughly 70 workers participated in their hour-long demonstration Thursday night. He said one worker walked off his shift as he saw others rallying outside. Wal-Mart has denied that it has retaliated against protesting workers, and said Friday that it has offered special holiday discounts to its employees for their efforts this season.

One employee at a store near Pittsburgh told CNNMoney he had heard of the protests only through the media. In an effort to stop the protests, Wal-Mart filed a complaint last week with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the demonstrations violated labor laws. The retailer said the actions have disrupted business, and that the workers' ongoing actions violate the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits picketing for any period over 30 days without filing a petition to form a union. On Tuesday, OUR Walmart filed its own charge with the federal agency, claiming that Wal-Mart tried to deter workers from participating in the protests and interfered with their right to speak up. But the NLRB was not able to rule in time or issue an injunction. Nancy Cleeland, a spokeswoman for the NLRB, said the complaint is too complex to make a ruling so soon.

The Indian cricket board, along with its Australian, English and South African counterparts, is planning a move that might see Test cricket being divided into two tiers with provisions for promotion and relegation. Representatives of these four cricket boards met on the sidelines of the ICC Board meeting in Dubai earlier this month and discussed the possibilities of a bifurcation. From the preliminary discussions two schools of thought have emerged. One prefers an elite group with the ëBig Fourí and the rest at a lower level, while the other idea is to have 10 teams on board ó top eight qualifying automatically and the other two coming through play-offs. The first idea doesnít have too much clarity about promotion and relegation and whether the teams outside the top rung could rub shoulders with the elites. Still, this possibility cannot completely be ruled out. The second idea sounds more feasible with top eight teams in the ICC rankings automatically making the grade and two other teams joining them through play-offs. If this format is agreed upon, then it might pave the way for associate members like Ireland and Afghanistan to make into the Test arena if they score over Bangladesh and Zimbabwe ó the two bottom ranked ëFull Memberí nations ó in the play-offs.

We can finalise the modalities only after we reach an agreement over the format and things are accepted and confirmed,î said a BCCI insider, speaking to The Indian Express. Basically, the ëBig Fourí are mulling a change to counterbalance the imminent death of the proposed ICC Test Championship in 2017, which doesnít have commercial and broadcastersí backing.

447,"Related. Arvind Kejriwal came in for some criticism from former Team Anna member Kiran Bedi for lack of organisation at the AAPís first Janta Durbar in Delhi on Saturday. She said the chaos at the public meeting was a sign of Kejriwalís ìinexperienceî and he needed to ìlisten, absorb and take considered decisionsî. She said Kejriwal had ìmade friends of his enemiesî by opposing the BJP and allowing the ìCongress to use himî. Bedi told Newsline, ìNo one can claim that he has experience as an administrator. Heís a very strong activist and a very strong organiser. But during this public meeting, his inexperience showed.î She said Kejriwal needed to realise that public meetings couldnít be held on the streets. ìPublic meetings need to be conducted in offices and not on streets. He needs to give himself time. There is a difference between giving yourself deadlines and rushing,î Bedi said. The retired IPS officer said, ìThe entire anti-corruption movement was against the Congress. Whether we were talking about the Coal scam, or the 2G scam, we were not against the BJP. In fact, we sought time from both Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj to help us formulate the Jan Lokpal Bill,î she said. Bedi had worked with Kejriwal and was part of Team Anna during the Janlokpal movement in 2011. Explaining the differences that had led her to leave the movement, Bedi said the Jan Lokpal Bill agitation was ìnot against the BJPî and the split† was in part due to Arvind Kejriwalís decision to ìhit out at all partiesî.","Secretariats are not run from rooftops, Bedi tells Kejriwal  | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/secretariats-are-not-run-from-rooftops-bedi-tells-kejriwal/
448,"So you want to join an accelerator? Here's how. Startup accelerators are nothing new, offering intensive programs that promise to help young companies grow faster and smarter. The latest twist? Niche accelerators that focus on a particular industry or mission -- whether it's healthcare services or building sustainable products. ""We've seen our application numbers triple over the last three years,"" says Wes Selke, founding director of Better Ventures , a San Francisco accelerator that caters to environmental and social startups. In the past two to three years, 200 to 300 new accelerators have opened worldwide, says Patrick Riley, executive director of the Global Accelerator Network, a Boulder for-profit that provides member accelerators with standardized curriculum, guidelines and services. ""I'm approached by at least two or three people a week who are thinking about starting an accelerator or who have just launched one,"" he says. A specialty accelerator surrounds entrepreneurs with like-minded people, offering access to top experts, early clients and introductions to investors in their field. But joining any accelerator -- especially a niche program -- can be risky, as focus areas within an industry can be wide ranging. So an entrepreneur who built software for a health insurer might wind up sitting through talks on topics like regulatory drug approvals. What's more, industry-specific programs could scare off some investors and can limit the ability to pivot. ""You could get pigeonholed,"" says Riley. It could be tough to switch gears mid-way through the program if you find your future is in a different industry, he says. Picking wisely is key, since an accelerator that's a bad fit can wind up being a big time sink and an expensive way to finance your business, since most startups give up a portion of equity to enter an accelerator. The Global Accelerator Network offers an online database to search for programs by region, graduates and focus. Here are some tips to find the right fit: Know what you need: Understand exactly what the accelerator is offering, whether it's advice, funding, investor introductions or office space. Be clear about the value you expect, and make sure it has a realistic chance of delivering. Investigate their track record: Ask about an accelerator's past performance and talk to other graduates. Directors should be qualified to offer startup advice and have credible connections. Check out the number of graduates and their progress. Do they have momentum? ""If they're not the kind of people or companies you respect and would like to be like, then it's probably not a good idea to join that accelerator,"" says Sam Chaufdhary, co-founder of ClassDojo, an education software startup that joined ImagineK12 , an education-oriented accelerator in San Francisco. If the accelerator hides their results, Riley says, it's a bad sign. Consider the terms: Most accelerator programs take an equity stake for their investment. If they want undiluted shares and ask for a board seat, that's a red flag. Undiluted shares, in particular, can complicate follow-on investments and turn off new investors. Analyze the mentors: A strong accelerator program should have 40 to 60 mentors, says Riley. Look to see if their expertise matches your needs and what kind of time you'll get with them. Is it quality one-on-one or do the mentors appear for an hour-long Q&A session? Some programs rely solely on guidance from mentors, while others follow a startup curriculum much like going to school. Neither is ""right,"" it just depends on which is a better fit for your company, says Riley.","So you want to join an accelerator?

449,"Who's signing up for Obamacare? Now we know a little more about the nearly 2.2 million people who signed up for Obamacare last year. About a quarter of the enrollees are in the coveted 18 to 34 age bracket, and more than half of them are women, according to data released Monday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). While the White House released the total number of sign-ups in the first three months of December a few weeks ago, this is the first detailed demographic look at the Obamacare applicants. And the demographics are very important. Insurers based their premiums on a decent share of younger, healthier Americans enrolling on the exchanges to balance out older, sicker applicants, who run up higher bills. If too few young people sign up, premiums for 2015 could rise to reflect the increased risk and cost. So far, the share of younger applicants is running below the expectations of experts and the White House itself. No one knows what the magic number should be, but the mix within each state matters as much as the overall pool nationwide. Administration officials said they are pleased with the pool so far. The 24% of younger Americans who have signed up is comparable to their share of the population, said Nancy Delew, the HHS acting deputy assistant secretary for planning and evaluation. She is expecting more young adults to sign up before open enrollment ends on March 31. ""We need to continue and accelerate our outreach efforts to the population, both the younger population as well as others,"" said Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform for the HHS. ""We are confident based on the results we have now that we'll have the appropriate mix of individuals enrolled in coverage."" Still, a Kaiser Family Foundation report last month said 40% of the potential exchange market -- legal residents who are currently uninsured or buy their own insurance and aren't eligible for Medicaid or employer-based plans -- are ages 18 to 34. The administration had originally hoped that closer to 40% of enrollees would be younger Americans. The White House is engaging in a grassroots campaign to get young people to enroll, including outreach efforts in the 25 metro areas served by the federal exchange with the highest level of uninsured youths, a senior administration official said. Meanwhile, some 33% of Obamacare applicants are age 55 to 64, about twice the demographic's share of the eligible market, according to Kaiser. Those age 65 and up are not eligible to buy plans on the exchanges because they are eligible for Medicare. The HHS data released also showed that 60% of those signing up selected silver plans, which are the second lowest tier. Another 20% picked the lowest bronze category, while 13% chose gold and 7% the highest platinum category. Only 1% selected catastrophic plans, which are open only to those under age 30 or who qualify for a hardship exemption. Late last year, President Obama allowed those whose individual insurance plans were canceled to apply for hardship exemptions. Some 79% are receiving federal subsidies to defray the cost of premiums or out-of-pocket expenses. Some 957,000 people signed up for insurance through the exchanges run by 14 states and Washington D.C., and another 1.2 million through the federal exchange, which is managing enrollment in the remaining 36 states. These figures include both people who have completed enrollment by paying their first month's premium , as well as those who have not. Many insurers had set Jan. 10 as a payment deadline for coverage retroactive to Jan. 1, though many have since pushed back that due date. Another 1.6 million people have been determined eligible for Medicaid through the exchanges. A total of 3.9 million people have signed up for Medicaid through exchanges and state agencies, though some of them are renewals. Healthcare.gov fails the uninsured. The demographic trends of applicants vary widely by state. West Virginia and Wisconsin have a higher-than-average number of older applicants, with 45% of them between the age 55 to 64. On the flip side, some 37% of D.C. applicants are between 26 and 34. Obamacare is allowing young people to obtain coverage for the first time, said Aaron Smith, co-founder of Young Invincibles, which is helping the administration reach out to younger Americans. The main reason many in this age group are uninsured is because they can't afford coverage. But under Obamacare, many can find plans in the $50 to $70 range, he said.","Who's signing up for Obamacare? - Jan. 13, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/13/news/economy/obamacare-enrollment/index.html
450,"What you'll actually pay for Obamacare. Obamacare subsidies defray how much lower-income consumers have to pay for insurance. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Millions of Americans won't have to pay full price for their Obamacare health insurance next year. But just how much they'll have to fork over depends on a couple different things. Thanks to subsidies from the federal government, which will help pay for health insurance on state-based exchanges starting in 2014, many low- to moderate-income Americans will get a break on their premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 48% of Americans who buy individual insurance today would be eligible for subsidies. They would receive an average of $5,548, which would cover 66% of the price. ""The subsidies are pretty large for the people who get them,"" said Gary Claxton, vice president at the foundation, noting that a larger share of new enrollees in the individual market will be eligible for subsidies since they are likely to be lower income Americans who cannot not afford coverage now. Here's how you qualify: Your income: Anyone earning up to 400% of the poverty line will be eligible for a subsidy, which is up to $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four. The lower your income, the larger your subsidy. For instance, those making $17,235 a year will pay no more than 4% of income, or $57 a month, while those with incomes between $34,470 and $45,960 will pay a maximum of 9.5% of income, or $364 a month. The federal government will cover the rest. Anyone earning more than $45,960 would be responsible for the entire tab on the Obamacare health plan of his choice. In addition to premium subsidies, those making less than 250% of the poverty line, or $28,725 for a single person and $58,875 for a family of four, are eligible for extra subsidies to defray out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-payments. When signing up for Obamacare, enrollees can apply for an advanced subsidy by estimating their income. Payments go directly to the insurer. Their subsidy level is then adjusted once they file a tax return with their actual income for the year, so in many cases they may have to repay some of the subsidy if they underestimated or get a refund if they thought they'd earn more than they actually did. Enrollees can also opt to pay the entire premium up front and get a refund at tax time. Your state: If you qualify, the size of your subsidy will vary by where you live. That's because the amount is based on the cost of the second-lowest silver plan in your area and works on a sliding scale. To get a better idea of the subsidy amounts, take a look at California , where a 40-year-old can buy the second-cheapest silver plan for $294 a month. If that resident made just under $17,235, he would get a subsidy of $236 and pay a maximum of $57. That person would also have no deductible and pay only $3 for primary care visits because he is getting additional subsidies to minimize his out-of-pocket costs. If his income was just under $28,725, his subsidy would only be $101 and he'd have to fork over as much as $193 a month. He'd have a $1,500 deductible and pay $40 a visit. And if that Californian earned $45,960 or more, he would pay the full cost of up to $294 a month and receive no subsidy. His deductible would be $2,000 and his co-pay would total $45 per visit. (These figures are statewide averages and vary by region.) Obamacare out-of-pocket cost confusion. While the subsidies will certainly help, many folks may still think Obamacare is pretty pricey. ""For a lot of people who are barely making the rent and struggling to pay for groceries, even a very modest premium can seem out of reach,"" said Sabrina Corlette, senior research fellow at Georgetown's Health Policy Institute.

451,"Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez is led into his court appearance at the Fall River Superior Court in Fall River, Mass. in December 2013 Photo: AP Photo/Boston Herald, Matt Stone. BRISTOL, Conn. ó Police believe former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez was in an SUV when someone inside shot two people to death in Boston in 2012, according to a search warrant filed in Connecticut. The warrant does not indicate who investigators believe pulled the trigger or suggest a motive in the shooting of Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado in Bostonís South End. No charges have been filed in the case. An attorney for Hernandez did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday. Hernandez came under scrutiny in the shooting following his arrest in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player whose body was found June 17 near Hernandezís North Attleborough, Mass., home. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in that case. In searching a home of Hernandezís uncle in Bristol, Conn., police found the SUV wanted in the 2012 shooting in Boston. The new search warrant, first reported by The Hartford Courant, was filed in Bristol Superior Court. It sought recordings of phone calls made by a Hernandez associate, Alexander Bradley, while Bradley was jailed in Hartford for failing to appear before a Massachusetts grand jury investigating the 2012 shooting. Bradley has alleged in a pending lawsuit in Florida that Hernandez shot him in the face after they argued outside a Miami club in February 2013. The search warrant filed by Bristol police provides some of the first details of Hernandezís alleged link to the Boston shooting. Surveillance camera recordings showed Hernandez and Bradley going into the Boston nightclub Cure at about 12:30 a.m. on July 16, 2012, shortly after the shooting victims went into the club, according to the warrant. Video footage shows Hernandez and Bradley leaving the club about 10 minutes later and Hernandez then driving a Toyota 4Runner SUV out of a parking garage just after 1:15 a.m., police said. The footage shows the victims leaving the club at about 2:10 a.m., and Hernandezís SUV passing by them twice as they walked to a parking garage to get their car, the warrant says. A third man who was shot in the car but survived, Aquilino Freire, told police an SUV pulled up next to them while they were stopped at a traffic light, and he saw someone in the SUVís back seat laughing, the warrant says. Then, several gunshots were fired from the rear passenger seat into the car, Freire told police.",Warrant links Aaron Hernandez to 2012 Boston shooting | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/08/warrant-links-aaron-hernandez-to-2012-boston-shooting/

456,"Help! I can't use my Obamacare benefits. Jeanne Patterson needs to go to the doctor but can't get through to her insurer to use her new Obamacare benefits. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Jeanne Patterson really needs to see a doctor but had to cancel her appointment last week. Why? Because her new Obamacare benefits were not in order, forcing her to spend hours and hours on hold with her insurer, Independence Blue Cross. Many folks who signed up for coverage through the state and federal exchanges are running into roadblocks now that they are trying to use their new benefits. And though exchange officials and insurers have urged consumers to call their insurers if they encounter problems, many say they either wait endlessly on hold or get the runaround. Coverage for the first wave of Obamacare applicants took effect Jan. 1. Patterson's journey started New Year's Day, when she landed in the emergency room for a stomach ailment. The Independence policy number she received didn't work and the hospital required her to sign a form saying she would pay for care herself, though it agreed to bill her later. She then received an ID card for her HMO plan in the mail a few days later, so she made an appointment with her primary care doctor and a gastric specialist for follow up. But when the 59-year-old went to her doctor last week, she was told he couldn't see her because she hadn't designated him as her primary care provider. If she wanted to be treated, she'd have to pay for the visit and lab work and request reimbursement. She spent an hour on hold with Independence trying to fix the problem and left the office without care. Patterson, who has previously always had insurance , said she was not told she had to designate a primary care provider in Independence's system before seeing the doctor. When she got home, she went online and did that, but learned she'd have to wait until February to make an appointment. That was too long a delay. So, she called Independence three or four times a day, spending more than an hour on hold each time hoping to get a representative to waive the waiting period. But she would hang up before reaching anyone. ""I can't get a person no matter what I do,"" said Patterson, who is unemployed and lives with her husband in Drexel Hill, Penn. After being contacted by CNNMoney Friday, an Independence executive reached out to Patterson and confirmed that she has had coverage since Jan. 1 and her primary care doctor designation is in order. Brian Lobley, senior vice president of marketing and consumer business, told CNNMoney he did not know why Patterson had problems at the doctor's office or hospital, but told her to call him if any issues persisted. The company has seen a significant number of consumers, particularly new members, calling its help line for assistance in using their benefits, getting ID cards and making payments, Lobley said. He acknowledged that hold times have increased to an average of 40 to 50 minutes, but said Independence has increased its staff by 20% to 25% and has extended its hours to accommodate the crush. Patterson will find out this week if her coverage is in fact in order when she calls her primary care doctor to make another appointment. ""I don't want to get my hopes up too high,"" she said Friday. Others found they ran into similar walls. Matt and Nancy Parisi were waiting weeks to resolve a problem with Cigna ( CI , Fortune 500 ) , which could not find the Tequesta, Fla., couple in its system. They called repeatedly to get their ID number so he could fill a prescription and she could visit the doctor, but were either left waiting on hold or bounced around from department to department. ""They put you on hold until they wear you out,"" said Matt Parisi, 63, a fisherman, who had to pay $40 out-of-pocket to get his high blood pressure medication. ""It's very uncomfortable to think that if we had to go to the hospital right now, we could face a quarter-million [dollar] bill because Cigna can't find us."" After CNNMoney reached out to the insurer Friday to check their status, the couple received a call from a Cigna supervisor, who gave them their ID number and emailed them a letter confirming coverage. However, the supervisor said the Parisis still won't show up in the insurer's system for the time being. ""As long as I have the ID number, it's a step in the right direction,"" Matt Parisi said, though he said they'll feel more confident that they actually have insurance when they get an ID card in the mail. That's when they'll make a doctor's appointment for his wife's shoulder issue. Healthcare.gov fails the uninsured. A Cigna spokesman told CNNMoney the company has taken multiple steps to help new exchange applicants activate their coverage, including establishing dedicated teams specifically trained to handle new enrollees' issues. It is also offering new exchange customers a secure email address where they can submit their questions. Some people, however, have just given up trying to get through. Kyle Watts of Louisville, Ohio, has been trying to reach Anthem Blue Cross for a month. He and his wife were excited to sign up on healthcare.gov in early December because they were eligible for subsidies that would save them $6,000 in premiums annually. Aware the policy wouldn't be active until they paid their first premium, they called Anthem to find out where to send the check. But they grew concerned after the check was not cashed, so they went onto the Anthem website and paid with a credit card last month. Though they got a payment confirmation email and were told they'd get an enrollment confirmation letter, they never received anything further from the company and remain without an ID number. Also, the charge has not appeared on their credit card statement. Watts, a retired administrator for a non-profit group, has spent hours on Anthem's customer service line before hanging up in frustration. He also called healthcare.gov to try to switch to another insurer, but was told he's not allowed to cancel a policy mid-year. Feeling he had no other alternative, he begged his former insurer to reactivate their policies on a month-to-month basis so the couple would have some coverage, though it costs $405 a month more and has higher deductibles. If Anthem eventually comes through, he'll go with them because he feels boxed in. ""I don't want to deal with this company,"" said Watts, 64. ""It won't be good for us. But what other choice do I have?"" Also, it is experiencing ""an unprecedented level of questions"" from members through its call centers, the spokeswoman said. On Jan. 2 and Jan. 3, representatives fielded 1 million calls, the average number it normally receives in a month across all its health insurance divisions. WellPoint also has extended its call center hours and initiated a voice response system to direct callers in hopes of reducing wait times. The spokeswoman said a customer service representative would look into Watts' case.","Help!

457,"Who will pay more under Obamacare? Young men. But some people, particularly young men who aren't insured through their employers, could see their premiums go up once coverage in the state-based insurance exchanges begins in January. Many groups have come out with reports forecasting what will happen to premiums, on average, next year. But just what folks will pay for insurance on the individual market depends on a variety of factors. They include the enrollee's income, age, gender, current coverage level and state of residence. ""The average isn't very relevant to any particular person,"" said Jim O'Connor, principal at consulting firm Milliman , who authored a report on how ""Obamacare"" will affect premiums. The exact cost of plans likely won't be known until the summer, at the earliest -- and possibly not until the exchanges open for enrollment in October. Insurers have already submitted their proposals to state officials, and regulators are now reviewing them. But it is up to each state to decide when to release the plan specifics. Few insurers have disclosed their individual market plan prices for next year, but several have warned that they're likely to rise significantly. In Maryland, for instance, Blue Cross has said its premiums could go up 25%. Participants will have the opportunity to pick from a variety of plans offered by several different insurers. They range from ""bronze"" plans with low premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs to platinum plans that carry higher premiums but cover more expenses. One key provision is that those with pre-existing conditions cannot be excluded or charged more for coverage. Until now, many cancer survivors, heart attack sufferers and those with other ailments have found it tough to get insurance. The new rule is great for those who have been sick, since they can now obtain more affordable plans, but it is likely to make things more expensive for the healthy people who get insurance by raising the overall cost of coverage. Here's what could affect your coverage cost. This breakdown is only for those who buy plans on the individual market through the exchanges, and doesn't apply to those with employer-sponsored plans. Income: One of the top factors determining how much you'll pay next year is your income. That's because subsidies are available to those with incomes of up to 400% of the poverty line -- roughly $45,000 for an individual or $92,000 for a family of four. Some 57% of enrollees will receive subsidies , and those subsidies will cover nearly two-thirds of the premium, on average, according to the Congressional Budget Office's estimates. Age: Older Americans, who tend to be sicker, will likely see their premiums go down, because they will now be mixed into a risk pool with younger, healthier people. Also, Obamacare limits the amount insurers can charge older enrollees to three times the amount charged for younger participants. It's now common to see older folks charged five times that of their younger peers. ""Younger people will have to offset costs of those who are older,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a lobbying group for insurers. Gender: Currently insurers can charge premiums based on gender. Men usually pay less than women, since they typically visit the doctor less frequently. The Affordable Care Act, however, doesn't allow insurers to charge different rates to men and women. Taken together, men ages 25 to 36 could see rate increases greater than 50%, according to Milliman's O'Connor, but women of the same age will only see their premiums creep up 4%. Meanwhile, men age 60 to 64 could see their premiums drop by 12%. Why your hospital bill is so high. Coverage level: The uninsured will see their coverage costs go up, of course, since they currently pay nothing. And those who have high-deductible plans or catastrophic coverage, which only pays out in case of major illness or hospitalization, may see their premiums go up. Supporters of the law point out that while monthly premiums may rise, the overall coverage those premiums are buying is more comprehensive. That means that those who actually use medical services could save money overall, thanks to lower out-of-pocket charges. Under the ACA, insurers must provide a suite of ""essential benefits,"" including maternity care, mental health and medications. Also, even if enrollees pick the cheapest plan, they will not have to cover more than 40%, on average, of the cost of their services. They will also not be subject to annual or lifetime limits on coverage. State of residence: Some states currently require some of the same protections as Obamacare, which pushes up the cost of individual market coverage for residents today. These spots include Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Vermont. Premiums could go down in those states, since more younger, healthier people are likely to join the market. At this point, everyone -- including the insurers -- is just guessing at what premiums should be. That makes next year a giant experiment. Will younger, healthier people purchase coverage, or will they skip it and simply pay the fine? Next year, the fine starts at $95 per adult -- a rate likely to be cheaper than any individual plan available on the state exchanges.","Who will pay higher premiums under Obamacare?

458,"Millennials turn up heat against low wages. Janah Bailey, 21, has participated in several strikes for higher pay at her fast food job over the last year. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Millennials are starting to get restless for change. Stuck in low-wage or part-time jobs with mountains of student loans to pay off, the generation that came of age in the new millennium finds itself in a hopeless situation. Despite being better educated than previous generations, many young people are shut out of the middle class with no road map of how to get there. So many of them are joining protests, showing up at rallies, or forming unions to improve their situation. Some achieved a measure of success. Debbra Alexis, a 27-year-old Victoria's Secret employee with a bachelor's degree in health sciences, gathered more than 800 signatures in support of her campaign for higher pay at her New York City store . The store, part of L Brands ( LB ) , ended up giving across-the-board raises of about $1 to $2 per hour to all workers in the Herald Square store. Janah Bailey has participated in several strikes in Chicago, where union-backed groups Fast Food Forward and Fight for 15 have been calling for $15 an hour pay. Bailey, 21, is studying to be a cosmetologist and works two jobs -- 40 hours at Wendy's ( WEN ) and 12 to 16 hours a week at McDonald's ( MCD , Fortune 500 ) . Her weekly paycheck is usually about $400, or about $20,000 a year. Bailey is the primary caregiver of her family of two younger siblings and mom. She pays $750 a month for rent, $50 for heat and $300 for groceries. Her checking account has $5 and her savings account is empty. ""We see a lot of people who get degrees and they're still struggling to find better paying jobs,"" she said. ""I'm speaking out because my plan may not land me where I want to go."" Bailey's concerns are not unfounded. The number of minimum wage workers with associates degrees, or in occupational programs like she is, more than doubled to 223,000 from 2007, according to the U.S. Labor Department. The number of college graduates in minimum wage jobs also doubled during the recession to 284,000 in 2012 from 2007. ""They're coming out of college with huge debts and having to take low-wage jobs. [So they're] trying to fight back,"" said Bill O'Meara, president of the Newspaper Guild of New York, which represents a group of Kaplan tutors in New York City who unionized hoping to bargain higher pay. Middle class jobs have lost ground just as millennials have entered the workforce. Some 58% of the jobs created during the recent economic recovery have been low-wage positions like retail and food prep workers, according to a 2012 report by the National Employment Law Project. These low-wage jobs had a median hourly wage of $13.83 or less. Median household income has also dropped by more than $4,000 since 2000, according to the Census Bureau. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said more young people are joining protests now because the unions' demands resonate with them. Raising the minimum wage and securing better hours , or speaking up for better working conditions, are a big part of the public discourse of the times. President Obama has lately talked about rising inequality and called for a higher minimum wage. In a speech earlier this month, Obama said, ""We know that there are airport workers and fast food workers and and nurse assistants and retail sales workers who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty. And that's why it's well past the time to raise a minimum wage."" Obama on social mobility in America. Bailey, the Chicago fast food worker, said such political backing gives her hope that things can change. ""Every time I think of the campaign, I think ... it would be a victory,"" she said. ""It would mean financial freedom.""","Millennials turn up heat against low wages - Jan. 6, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/06/news/economy/millennial-low-wages-protests/index.html
459,"Far fewer mortgage borrowers 'deeply underwater' Las Vegas still has more homeowners deeply underwater than any other city, leading to a lot of foreclosures. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) A growing number of mortgage borrowers are keeping their heads above water, according to a report from RealtyTrac. The company reported Thursday that 9.3 million properties, or 19% of all homes with mortgages, were ""deeply underwater"" in December, meaning borrowers owed at least 25% more on their mortgage than the home was worth. That's down significantly from 26% of all homes with mortgages, or 10.9 million properties, last January, RealtyTrac reported. A recovery in home prices has certainly helped to turn around the fortunes of many homeowners. The average U.S. home price jumped nearly 14% year-over-year through October (the latest data available), according to the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index. That has added thousands of dollars to the average home's value. An increase in home equity typically means fewer foreclosures , said Daren Blomquist, a spokesman for RealtyTrac. ""Negative equity is the foundation that foreclosures are built on, but you need another event -- a job loss or illness, for example -- to trigger a foreclosure,"" said Blomquist. The more deeply underwater borrowers are, the more likely they are to conclude that it makes little sense to continue to pay off their loans when money is tight. ""It takes away their motivation to save their properties,"" said Blomquist. They also have one less financial asset to tap into should they hit a financial rough patch. And it makes it harder to sell the home. Borrowers typically have to do a ""short sale,"" which is subject to the approval of their lender. If they can't get a short sale approved, they could end up in foreclosure. Even though far fewer people are underwater on their homes than last year, it doesn't mean the foreclosure crisis is completely over. ""There are still millions of homeowners who are in such a deep hole that it will take years for them to regain their equity,"" Blomquist said. ""The longer these homeowners remain in a negative equity position, the more likely that foreclosure will become the path of least resistance for them."" 2014 economy will 'return to normal' The states with the highest percentage of deeply underwater homes in December were Nevada with 38%, Florida (34%), Illinois (32%), and Michigan (31%). Metro areas where borrowers are still struggling to get above water include Las Vegas (41%), Orlando, Fla., (36%), Detroit (35%), Tampa, Fla., (35%), Miami (33%), and Chicago (33%). On the other end of the spectrum, the number of equity-rich homeowners -- those with at least 50% equity in their homes -- grew significantly by the end of 2013. Blomquist said the number of equity-rich homes rose to 9.1 million, or 18% of all mortgaged homes, in the last quarter of 2013 compared with 7.4 million, or 16% of homes, three months earlier. In Hawaii, 36% or mortgage borrowers were in this equity-rich position. New York, California, Montana, and Maine also claimed a high percentages of these borrowers.","Far fewer mortgage borrowers 'deeply underwater' - Jan. 9, 2014",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/09/real_estate/underwater-mortgages/index.html
460,"It most certainly would have been higher had notices not plunged in November and December as banks halted tens of thousands of foreclosures in the face of the robo-signing scandal . ""Total properties receiving foreclosure filings would have easily exceeded 3 million in 2010 had it not been for the fourth quarter drop in foreclosure activity,"" said James Saccacio, RealtyTrac's CEO. ""Many of the foreclosure proceedings that were stopped in late 2010 -- which we estimate may be as high as a quarter million -- will likely be re-started and add to [foreclosure] numbers in early 2011."" For the fourth consecutive year, Nevada led the nation in the rate of foreclosures with one of every 11 households there receiving at least one filing in 2010. Still, that constituted a 5.3% improvement from a year earlier. In Arizona, one of every 17 households received a filing in 2010, down 4.5% for the year. Florida's 2010 foreclosures (one in 18 households) dropped 6.1% year-over-year, and California (one in 25) fell 8.5%. Overall, 2010 was a rough one for the mortgage industry. The big news was the robo-signing scandal, which erupted in the fall amid allegations that banks were foreclosing on homes without having read the documentation. Then, President Obama's efforts to fend off foreclosures foundered as the year wore on and the potential for ever more massive foreclosures ballooned. At the beginning of 2010, the bloom had not yet faded from Obama's HAMP (Home Affordable Modification Program ) program, and many analysts were optimistic it would help many people save their homes. By April, it became apparent that the program was losing the foreclosure fight; there were reports of 10 new defaults for every HAMP modification and the projections for the number of borrowers who would actually receive a HAMP mod had nose-dived to 1 million from 4 million. Then the next shoe to drop came in June, with a report from Fitch Ratings that showed HAMP modifications re-defaulting at a high clip . The company forecast that three-quarters of all HAMP mods would ultimately fail. The foreclosure prevention program really started to fade by mid-summer: Fewer than 37,000 loans received HAMP modifications in July, down from more than 50,000 a month earlier. Only 435,000 loans had gotten permanent modifications through the program. The next few years could be difficult. Some industry analysts, such as Laurie Goodman, head of Amherst Securities mortgage group, say that as many as 11 million mortgage borrowers are in potential danger of default. However, Rick Sharga, RealtyTrac's spokesman, predicted 4 million to 5 million and scoffed at quantifying the magnitude of the potential disaster, comparing it to ""taking inventory of deck chairs on the Titanic.""","1 million homes repossessed in 2010 - Jan. 13, 2011",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/13/real_estate/foreclosures_2010/index.htm
461,"BONNE TERRE, Mo. ó Joseph Paul Franklin, a white supremacist who targeted blacks and Jews in a cross-country killing spree from 1977 to 1980, was put to death Wednesday in Missouri, the stateís first execution in nearly three years. Franklin, 63, was executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre for killing Gerald Gordon in a sniper shooting at a suburban St. Louis synagogue in 1977. Franklin was convicted of seven other murders across the country and claimed responsibility for up to 20 overall, but the Missouri case was the only one that brought a death sentence. Mike OíConnell, of the Missouri Department of Corrections, said Franklin was pronounced dead at 6:17 a.m. The execution was the first in Missouri using a single drug, pentobarbital. Franklinís fate was sealed early Wednesday when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a federal appeals court ruling that overturned two stays granted Tuesday evening by district court judges in Missouri.

Franklin also admitted to shooting and wounding civil rights leader Vernon Jordan and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since the attack in 1978. Franklin, a paranoid schizophrenic who grew up in Mobile, Ala., was in his mid-20s in 1977 when he began drifting across America, robbing up to 16 banks to fund his travels. He bombed a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tenn., in July that year. No one was hurt, but the killings began soon after that, many of them sniper shootings. Franklin had a particular dislike for interracial couples ó several of his victims were black men and the white women with them. He arrived in suburban St. Louis and picked out Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue from the Yellow Pages. On Oct. 8, 1977, a bar mitzvah ended and guests were in the parking lot when Franklin opened fire from a grassy area nearby, killing Gordon, 42. The killings continued for three more years. Franklin was finally caught after killing two young black men who were about to go jogging with two teenage white girls in Salt Lake City in August 1980. Years later, in federal prison, he admitted to the St. Louis County killing. He was sentenced to death in 1997.

462,"FBI agents took the unusual step of temporarily letting a federal death row inmate out of his cell so he could help with the search for the body of one of the two women he killed. Chadrick Evan Fulks, 36, was taken from the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., to West Virginia in March to help with the search for the remains of 19-year-old Samantha Nicole Burns, according to a sealed order obtained by The Associated Press. In a letter to The Associated Press, Fulks confirmed his role in the search for the Marshall University student last seen in 2002. He said he showed agents the area where Burns was buried during his and fellow inmate Brandon Bashamís 17-day crime spree after escaping the Hopkins County Jail in western Kentucky in 2002. The two-page order signed by U.S. District Judge Robert C. Chambers in Huntington, W.Va., allowed the FBI to take custody of Fulks for 18 hours between March 25 and April 12. Federal and state investigators conducted a search for Burnsí remains on land near train tracks and an intersection near West Virginia 75. Itís a rural area near where Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio meet. Fulks sent The AP a copy of the sealed order along with a nine-page letter in which he says he helped the FBI because he feels remorse for the slayings. Burns, of West Hamlin, W.Va., disappeared after telephoning her mother in November 2002 to tell her she was leaving the mall near Huntington, W.Va. and heading home to West Hamlin, about 15 miles away. Burns never reached home. The disappearance set off a massive manhunt that led to her burned-out vehicle about 15 minutes south of Huntington, W.Va. Her body has never been located. Fulks and Basham pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murder and were sentenced to life in prison. Messages left for the attorneys for Burnsí family were not returned. Because of the partial government shutdown, federal prosecutors in West Virginia declined to comment on the case. Messages left for West Virginia State Police were not immediately returned. It was unclear how close authorities were to finding Burnsí remains on Wednesday or what became of the search in March. Fulks and the 32-year-old Basham were sentenced to death for kidnapping and killing 44-year-old Alice Donovan of Galivants Ferry, S.C., in December 2002. Donovan disappeared from a Wal-Mart parking lot in Conway, S.C. Her remains were found in 2009. ìIíve worked with both the Donovan and Burns family to recover their loved ones,î Fulks said. Charlie Rose, who teaches criminal law at Stetson University Law School in Gulfport, Fla., said law enforcement agencies frequently ask inmates for information about unsolved crimes, but that itís unusual to take them out of their cells. Rose said bringing an inmate back to a crime scene could be advantageous if seeing the terrain and landmarks help to refresh his memory. Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola University Law School in Los Angeles, agreed that itís a big deal to expend the resources needed to keep a death row inmate secure during a search. ìIt obviously is something you donít see all the time,î Levenson said. ìLeaving death row for any purpose is highly unusual.î The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Fulksí latest appeal Monday. Bashamís appeal is pending. In the letter, Fulks, of West Hamlin, W.Va., asked for nothing from prosecutors in return for his assistance, foresaw the ruling and predicted he will be executed soon. ìMy life ended in 2002, sir, and next year Iíll begin a new journey when Iím releaved of this hell hole,î Fulks wrote. Fulks and Basham were cellmates at the Hopkins County Jail in Madisonville, Ky., in 2002 where they were held on armed robbery charges. They were left in the jailís recreation yard unsupervised for about 90 minutes and security cameras werenít in their normal positions on the day they escaped. Fulks and Basham escaped through a fence around the recreation yard and fled initially to Indiana. From there, the pair went to West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, where the run ended. ìI do wish that I wouldíve stayed in jail and faced those charges because these 2 women, Alice Donovan and Samantha Burns, would be alive today,î Fulks wrote. The families of Burns and Donovan settled a lawsuit with the jail in 2008 for an undisclosed amount. Fulks and Basham were dismissed from the lawsuit. Fulks said helping the FBI in the search for Burnsí remains will be one of two ways heíll leave death row. The other, Fulks said: ìWill be in the back of a hearse.î",Death row inmate let out of cell to look for victim | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/10/10/death-row-inmate-let-out-of-cell-to-look-for-victim/
463,"NEW DELHI ó An Indian court Friday sentenced to death four men for the December gang rape and murder of a young New Delhi woman, ordering them to the gallows for a brutal attack on a bus that left the woman with such severe internal injuries that she died two weeks later. The attack had transfixed India, where it was seen as a reflection on rampant mistreatment of women and the governmentís inability to deal with crime. ìIn these times, when crime against women is on the rise, the courts cannot turn a blind eye toward such gruesome crimes,î Judge Yogesh Khanna said in announcing the sentence. He said the attack ìshocked the collective conscienceî of India. A New Delhi police bus carrying the convicted men arrives at the Delhi Saket court complex on Sept. 13, 2013 Photo: EPA. After the death sentence, the wail of one of the four men, 20-year-old Vinay Sharma, filled the tiny courtroom. Sharma, an assistant at a gym, then broke down in sobs. As Khanna walked from his bench, defense lawyer A.P. Singh, who has defended all four men at various times, began to shout: ìThis is not the victory of truth. But it is the defeat of justice.î Like all death sentences, Khannaís order must be confirmed by Indiaís High Court. The men can appeal their case to the High Court, as well as to the Supreme Court, and ask the president for clemency. The victimís family, along with numerous politicians and government officials, had long called for the men to be executed. The family was in the courtroom as the sentence was announced, and were relieved at the results. ìI am very happy our girl has got justice,î said the victimís father, who cannot be named under Indian laws guarding his daughterís identity as a rape victim. The 23-year-old victim and a male friend ñ by all accounts they were not romantically involved ñ were coming home from an evening showing of the movie ìLife of Piî when the men lured them into boarding a bus they were joy-riding through the city. They quickly beat the friend, held the woman down and took turns raping her. They also penetrated her with a metal rod, causing the injuries that led to her death in a Singapore hospital. Indiaís Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty should be used only in ìthe rarest of rare cases,î though what defines those cases remains highly debated. Only two people ñ both terrorists ñ have been executed in India since 2004. Under intense pressure, the Congress party-led national government worked hard to project a tough-on-crime image after the attack, reforming a series of laws on sexual violence. Many in the Congress, which faces dwindling support and national elections next year, had made clear they wanted the men to be executed. Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who earlier in the week had said death sentences were assured, welcomed the sentence. ìThe victim and her family have got justice. It was a dastardly crime,î he told reporters in New Delhi. ìThe judge has set an example for anti-social elements that they would meet a similar fate if they committed such crimes.î Men and women stood outside the Saket Courthouse shouting for the death penalty for the four convicts Photo: Getty Images. The defense lawyer Singh, though, said politics had influenced the court. ìThe judge has given the death sentence under political pressure,î he said. ìThe punishment has been given at the governmentís insistence. `í An estimated 100 and 150 people are sentenced to death in India in most years, but the vast majority of those cases are eventually commuted to life in prison. The defendants, like the rape victim, lived on the bottom rungs of Indiaís booming economy. Nearly all came from families that had moved to New Delhi in recent years from desperately poor rural villages, hoping to find well-paying jobs in the capital. Few had such luck. One, Mukesh Singh, occasionally drove the bus where the crime occurred and cleaned it. Sharma, the gym assistant, was the only one of the attackers to graduate from high school. Akshay Thakur, 28, occasionally worked as a driverís helper on the bus. With them on the bus were two other men. Police say Ram Singh, 33, hanged himself in prison, though his family insists he was killed. Another man ñ an 18-year-old who was a juvenile at the time of the attack and cannot be identified under Indian law ñ was convicted in August and will serve the maximum sentence he faced, three years in a reform home. The young woman, though, was trying to escape the economic mire she had been born into. Her father supported five people ñ his wife, the woman and two younger sons ñ on a little over $200 a month working as an airport baggage handler. But while women remain second-class citizens in most Indian families, expected to stay home and care for their parents and then their husbands, her parents and brothers had supported her as she worked for an education, even helping her leave her home for a time to study physiotherapy. At the time of the attack, she was awaiting the results of exams for a physiotherapy degree.

464,"Related. More than a year after an expert committee of the union environment ministry cleared a proposal for the Bandra-Versova sea link, the cabinet sub-committee of infrastructure Wednesday discussed the Rs 4,045-crore project and sought changes in its financial model. The project, proposed by the NCP-controlled Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), is one of the many projects totaling Rs 13,000 crore, awaiting the Cabinet sub-committeeís approval. The sub-committee, chaired by Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, comprises nine Cabinet ministers, of which four belong to the Congress. All projects being undertaken on a build-operate-transfer mode and worth more than Rs 25 crore need a nod from the sub-committee. The Bandra-Versova sea link is a northwards extension to the Worli-Bandra sea link, and represents the last leg of the link which starts from Nariman Point (see highlight chart). The 9.9-km link is proposed to be a public private partnership (PPP) project. At the sub-committee meeting on Wednesday, members suggested the concession period be reduced from the originally proposed 30 years. ìThe concession period was found to be too high. Committee members were not comfortable with it. Members discussed that the MSRDC should make a sincere attempt to bring down the concession period,î said a government official who did not wish to be named. ìBesides elaborating the financial model, the MSRDC also explained the index plan, details on the ramps, technical information about the sea link and so on,î the official said. After re-examining the financial plan, the MSRDC will now have to take the proposal to the union government to obtain viability gap funding for the project, he added. Viability gap funding refers to the stateís monetary contribution to a project being implemented on a public private partnership model. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar of NCP had last week launched an offensive against the government for holding back decisions stating this may affect the combineís poll prospects. Some of the other projects of MSRDC, chaired by NCPís Jaydatt Kshirsagar, include a passenger water transport system around Mumbai, the Worli-Haji Ali sea link and capacity augmentation of the Mumbai-Pune expressway. According to the proposal that the MSRDC had submitted to the union Ministry of Environment and Forests while applying for an environment clearance, the Bandra-Versova sea link will be built 900 metres into the sea. It will have eight lanes and traffic dispersal points at Joggers Park and Juhu Koliwada. After discussions with the fisher folk there, the MSRDC has proposed spans of 50 metres each at Bandra and 100 metres at other locations. The Original Sea Link Plan. Nariman Point to Haji Ali ñ The plan was to build a sea link from Haji Ali to Priyadarshini Park, followed by a tunnel under Malabar Hill to Tambe chowk and another along Marine Drive. MSRDC in 2011 appointed a consultant to conduct a fresh feasibility study. However, the project is on the backburner now. Haji Ali to Worli ñ MSRDC had tendered the project to be constructed on a PPP basis. The project has remained a non-starter due to differences between MSRDC and RInfra over viability gap funding and land. The project is yet to be discussed by the sub-committee. Worli to Bandra ñ The sea link was constructed on a cash contract model and opened to public in 2009. The project has been criticised for not being able to draw as much traffic as was expected. Officials say the desired traffic level will be achieved only once the other arms to the sea link are constructed. Bandra to Versova ñ MSRDC has proposed to construct the 9.9-km sea link on PPP basis. The agency will approach the Centre for VGF and calling tenders after the sub-committee nod. The Alternative. The western freeway was originally planned over a decade ago as a network of sea links from Versova to Nariman Point, with the Bandra-Worli sea link conceived as a part of it.

The move has drawn criticism from educationists and parents, some of whom plan to approach the Education Minister to get the circular withdrawn. ìThe circulars were sent out on January 2. This is according to the Right to Education Act, 2009, mandate,î said a primary education official, who did not wish to be named. ìThe schools have to be functional for 200 days for classes 1 to 5 and for 220 days for classes 6 to 8 under the Act,î added the official. ìThe circular is not going to affect the Zilla Parishad (ZP) schools as they anyhow work more than the mandated number of days. This is because ZP schools do not have Saturdays off. Hence, we will not be affected by this order,î said Mushtakh Shaikh, ZP education officer, Pune. ìOnly the private schools will be affected because they have Saturdays off and many other holidays, which makes their working days go up to only 160 or less,î added Shaikh. The primary education officer said no school will be exempted from this rule. ìThis is not like the 25 per cent rule wherein the unaided minority schools are exempted from reserving 25 per cent seats for students from underprivileged sections of society. This will be applicable to all,î said the official. ìSome ZP schools also donít comply with this and give out more than necessary holidays. Action will be taken as per the provisions under the RTE Act against schools that do not comply with these norms. This rule will be implemented from this calendar year,î added the official. Mahavir Mane, Director, Primary Education, confirmed that the circular had been issued. However, the rule has come under fire from educationists, activists and even parents, especially since it has come into effect when the current academic year will end in two months. ìWhat kind of circular is this ? What were the officials doing when the RTE implementation started? And why issue the circular when the academic year is coming to an end,î asked former civic school principal Jayshree Marale. Iklas Sayyed, a parent, said: ìInstead of making schools a place where children should feel like coming back again and again, this move of making children slog for extra hours will only help develop hatred for education.

466,"MORE ON: WASHINGTON ó The sales job is on for a bipartisan $1.1 trillion spending bill that would pay for the operations of government through October and finally put to rest the bitter budget battles of last year. The massive measure contains dozens of trade-offs between Democrats and Republicans as it fleshes out the details of the budget deal that Congress passed last month. That pact gave relatively modest but much-sought relief to the Pentagon and domestic agencies after deep budget cuts last year. The GOP-led House is slated to pass the 1,582-page bill Wednesday, though many tea party conservatives are sure to oppose it. Democrats pleased with new money to educate preschoolers and build high-priority highway projects are likely to make up the difference even as Republican social conservatives fret about losing familiar battles over abortion policy. The bill would avert spending cuts that threatened construction of new aircraft carriers and next-generation Joint Strike Fighters. It maintains rent subsidies for the poor, awards federal civilian and military workers a 1 percent raise and beefs up security at US embassies across the globe. The Obama administration would be denied money to meet its full commitments to the International Monetary Fund but get much of the money it wanted to pay for implementation of the new health care law and the 2010 overhaul of financial regulations. ìThis agreement shows the American people that we can compromise, and that we can govern,î said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. ìIt puts an end to shutdown, slowdown, slamdown politics.î The House vote is expected less than 48 hours after the measure became public, even though Republicans promised a 72-hour review period for legislation during their campaign to take over the House in 2010. On Tuesday, the House is slated to approve a short-term funding bill to extend the Senateís deadline to finish the overall spending bill until midnight Saturday. The current short-term spending bill expires at midnight Wednesday evening. The measure doesnít contain in-your face victories for either side. The primary achievement was that there was an agreement in the first place after the collapse of the budget process last year, followed by a 16-day government shutdown and another brush with a disastrous default on US obligations. After the shutdown and debt crisis last fall, House Budget committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash., struck an agreement to avoid a repeat of the 5 percent cut applied to domestic agencies last year and to prevent the Pentagon from absorbing about $20 billion in new cuts on top of the ones that hit it last year. White House budget director Sylvia Mathews Burwell says the measure is a ìpositive stepî because it ìunwinds some of the damaging cuts caused by sequestration, ensures the continuation of critical services the American people depend on, and brings us closer to returning the budget process to regular order.î She also praised investments in early childhood education and infrastructure. To be sure, there is plenty for both parties to oppose in the legislation. Conservatives face a vote to finance implementation of President Barack Obamaís health care overhaul and Wall Street regulations, both enacted in 2010 over solid Republican opposition. A conservative-backed initiative to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions was dumped overboard and social conservatives failed to win new restrictions on abortion. Democrats must accept new money for abstinence education programs they often ridicule, and conservatives can take heart that overall spending for daily agency operations has been cut by $79 billion, or 7 percent, from the high-water mark established by Democrats in 2010. That cut increases to $165 billion, or 13 percent, when cuts in war funding and disaster spending are accounted for. Money for Obamaís high-speed rail program would be cut off, and rules restricting the sale of less efficient incandescent light bulbs would be blocked. Democrats are more likely to climb aboard than tea party Republicans, but only after voting to give Obama about $6 billion more in Pentagon war funding than the $79 billion he requested. The additional war money is helping the Pentagon deal with a cash crunch in troop readiness accounts. Including foreign aid related to overseas security operations, total war funding reaches $92 billion, a slight cut from last year. At the same time, the bill is laced with sweeteners. One is a provision exempting disabled veterans and war widows from a pension cut enacted last month. The bill contains increases for veteransí medical care backed by both sides and fully funds the $6.7 billion budget for food aid for low-income pregnant women and their children. Yet the National Institutes of Healthís proposed budget of $29.9 billion falls short of the $31 billion budget it won when Democrats controlled Congress. Democrats won a $100 million increase, to $600 million, for so-called TIGER grants for high-priority transportation infrastructure projects, a program that started with the 2009 stimulus bill. The spending bill would spare the Pentagon from a brutal second-wave cut of $20 billion in additional reductions on top of last yearís $34 billion sequestration cut, which forced furloughs of civilian employees and harmed training and readiness accounts. Consistent with recent defense measures, the bill largely fulfills the Pentagonís request for ships, aircraft, tanks, helicopters and other war-fighting equipment, including 29 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, eight new warships as requested by the Navy, and a variety of other aircraft like the V-22 Osprey, new and improved F-18 fighters and new Army helicopters.","Details, trade-offs emerge on Congressí $1.1T budget bill | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/14/details-trade-offs-emerge-on-congress-1-1t-budget-bill/
467,"The Senate yesterday followed the House of Representatives in approving a bipartisan budget deal that came about in a relative rush for Washington. The deal is very small beer in policy terms. Its passage is very big news in political terms. Itís small beer because it does very little except on the margins (save ensuring that the defense budget isnít simply hacked at willy-nilly, as it wouldíve been otherwise). Itís very big news because it completely alters the coming political dynamic in Washington for 2014. The conventional wisdom is that this change will benefit Republicans. Indeed, it may. Republicans who like the deal say that by taking the shutdown off the table the partyís politicians can devote the year to the ObamaCare disaster ó highlighting its problems, working to pass legislation to overhaul it, running hearings on it, doing everything to maintain the national focus on it. This way they can win the Senate back in 2014 and lay the groundwork for a Republican victory in 2016 on a platform of repealing it and replacing it. Canny Republicans say the deal lifts the threat of any more government shutdowns. But for some in the partyís base, the kind of showdown melodrama typified by the government shutdown has become their favorite thing. These showdowns are fund-raising bonanzas for groups that claim to speak for the partyís grassroots. And theyíre highly dramatic confrontations that occur almost for the sake of confrontation itself. Once the standoff is on, they view any effort to resolve it as a capitulation. They have some grounds for this view in recent history. In December 2010, with a New Yearís deadline looming, the president was forced to extend all the Bush tax cuts rather than cherry-picking the ones he wanted. That was humiliating for him and a triumph for conservatives. Then, in the summer of 2011, came the crisis over raising the debt ceiling (a different issue but one that also leads to a time-specific showdown). When President Obama proposed a series of draconian automatic cuts called a ìsequester,î the GOP called his bluff by accepting the deal; the president had believed the Right would not, because the sequester hit so hard at the defense budget. For some on the Right, the sequester magically turned into the best policy move of the past 15 years ó an effective budget freeze. The fact that it is indiscriminate and dangerous to the nationís military readiness pales, in the view of sequester-lovers, to the simple fact that it seemed to tie Washingtonís hands. Indeed, the sequesterís effect has been dramatic. Because federal government spending held the line while the economy grew, the budget deficit was cut in half ó though the overall national debt continues to grow. Twice, then, Republicans got things they wanted out of these showdowns. But they got nothing out of the big one, the overall government shutdown in October, in part because the target was just too large: repealing ObamaCare. Nonetheless, those who supported the shutdown have talked themselves into believing they ìwonî something ó namely, a new public focus on ObamaCare, which was already the focus of discussion in Washington and was already on its own becoming the most dramatic policy problem for an administration in living memory. So when you hear conservatives say they donít like the budget deal, you have to understand they donít want budget deals because they like these showdowns. The problem is, everybody else seems to hate them. Showdown politics seems risky and irresponsible, it threatens the countryís good name in the markets and abroad and it introduces a note of uncertainty into every economic move inside the United States. And this hurts everyone, as we know now ó not just the Republicans but Obama and the Democrats as well. Obamaís inability to make a deal with the GOP loses him leadership points in the presidential game, and when he loses, the Democrats lose their standing as well. So this budget deal may help him, too, even as it hurts him. The last thing he and his party need in 2014 is more reason for the public to question his competency as a leader when he already finds himself in such a crisis due to the botched ObamaCare rollout. Even as heís being beaten up next year over his legacy monstrosity, the president can always take a moment to look around and think: Could have been worse. What's Your Take?

468,"Home prices jump 13.6% Home prices posted another big annual gain in October, although there are signs that 2013's rapid rise in prices is close to topping out. The closely-followed S&P/Case-Shiller home price index was up 13.6% compared to a year ago, the largest 12-month gain since early 2006, which was the height of the housing bubble. Prices have been improving at a faster annual rate every month for nearly two years. But with the prospect of rising mortgage rates, October prices were little changed from September. ""Housing data suggest that we may be close to the peak gains in prices,"" said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. He said prices are expected to rise further in 2014, but the annual gain is expected to be in the single digits rather than the rapid rise recorded for much of this year. The slowdown in price gains is probably good for the market, according to Stan Humphries, chief economist for price tracker Zillow. ""Consumers looking at more recent reports should embrace this slowdown, as it will make for a more balanced market in 2014 and beyond,"" he said. But the fact that many homeowners still can't sell their homes because they owe more on them than they are worth, combined with years of low levels of home building , have left the nation with a tight supply of homes for sale. And that tight supply has helped to drive up prices. Mortgage rates have been rising steadily for months since hitting a record low in the spring. The rate on a 30-year loan is now 4.48%. That has also increased demand as potential buyers look to make a purchase before rates go higher. The gain in prices was widespread, with all 20 major markets tracked by the index posting solid gains. New York, where prices are up 4.9% in the last year, posted the smallest gain, while Las Vegas, which was hard hit by the bursting of the housing bubble, posted the largest gain at 27.1%. Despite the recent rise, the overall index is still about 20% below the record peak reached in July 2006 at the height of the housing bubble.","Home prices jump 13.6% - Dec. 31, 2013",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/31/news/economy/home-prices-jump/index.html

So, it was decided that the exams for the respective subject can be divided in two semesters, and the syllabus of the subjects will also be revised accordingly,î said a senior PU official.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi, in a letter written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday, sought his intervention and action against Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shindeís advisory on releasing minority youth detained wrongfully. Calling Shindeís remarks as ìbrazen attempt to woo the minority communityíí , Modi said it marked a ìnew lowî for the country. He added that the principles at stake were far too valuable to be sacrificed at the altar of ìpolitical expediencyî. Condemning the Home Ministerís suggestion of setting up review or screening committees to assess the role of minority youths languishing in jails on terror charges without trial, Modi urged the PM to advise Shinde not to direct his attention to only minorities. He added that Shindeís suggestion was against constitutional principles and the ìright to equality before the lawî. He said, ìA crime is a crime irrespective of the birth marks of the criminal. His religious beliefs could not determine the guilt or innocence.î Modi added that the proposed directive of setting up review committees was against the provision of criminal law, which does not provide for any review committee for withdrawal of pending cases where chargesheets have been filed. ìOne cannot rule out the possibility of trials getting delayed due to such illegal action on the part of the state if courts were to find faults with such interventions made on extraneous considerations. If this were to happen, undertrial prisoners will end up being under incarceration for longer periods, thus achieving exactly the opposite of the purported objective,î wrote Modi. Suggesting that Shinde should find a solution within the constitutional framework, Modi mentioned that an acceptable solution would be to fast-track all terror cases. He said that this would have the benefit of convicting and punishing the real perpetrators of terrorism while acquitting the innocent people within a time frame. Modi added that this approach would strengthen our fight against terror and take care of genuine cases of wrongful arrests, while also ensuring ìjustice to all, appeasement to noneî. Arguing that Shinde should focus on the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Modi said, ìIt would be interesting to know how many innocent youths are found to be wrongly implicated in NIA cases. I hope the Home Minister understands that every case of acquittal need not be a case of wrongful arrest and false/mala fide implication.î Modi said that Shindeís public statement, without the backing of reliable data, was highly undesirable. Quoting Article 44 of the Constitution, Modi said that we had not made much headway in having a common civil code. Article 44 says, ìThe state shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of Indiaî.

I tell them, if I had to flee, Modi would have never been born.î ìNo big vision is neededÖ but somebody has to take responsibility. It should not happen that you are ready to wear garlands, but flee when shoes (read criticisms) are hurled.

But that period did not inspire us.

476,"WASHINGTON ó Thirty-four nuclear missile launch officers have been implicated in a cheating scandal and have been stripped of their certification in what the Air Force believes is the largest such breach of integrity in the nuclear force, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said Wednesday. The officers apparently texted to each other the answers to a monthly test on their knowledge of how to operate the missiles. The number includes who did the cheating as well as those who may have known about it but did not report it. The cheating, which was discovered during a drug investigation that included two of the 34 officers, is the latest controversy involving the service members who maintain and operate the nationís 450 nuclear missiles. In all, the drug scandal encompassed 11 Air Force officers across six bases in the US and England. Of the three missile launch officers involved in the drug scandal, two were at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and one was at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyo. The two at Malmstrom were among those implicated in the cheating scandal. James told a Pentagon news conference that 600 missile crew members across the Air Force were retaking the test, including nearly 200 at Malmstrom. She said that the missile force needs attention and that while immediate corrective action is being taken, Air Force leaders are planning to address some longer-term initiatives. The Air Force said the alleged cheating took place late last summer. Last week the Pentagon disclosed the original drug probe of a total of 10 officers ó nine lieutenants and one captain ó at six bases. It provided few other details beyond saying the officers were suspected of possessing ìrecreational drugs.î That has now expanded to 11 officers. The matter is being probed by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. The Associated Press has reported that the Air Forceís nuclear arm has been weighed down by a series of problems involving security lapses and morale-related issues, leading one officer to complain of ìrotî in the force. The original disclosure of a drug investigation said the officers alleged to be involved were at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.; Schriever Air Force Base, Colo.; Royal Air Force base Lakenheath in England; Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., and two bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles ó F.E. Warren and Malmstrom. First word of the investigation came last Thursday moments before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel appeared at F.E.

Claiming that the allegations of sexual harassment made by a former woman intern as reported in the media was a ìproduct of sinister conspiracyî, chairperson of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and former Supreme court judge Swatanter Kumar on Wednesday filed a civil defamation suit in the Delhi High Court against The Indian Express and its reporter, television channels Times Now and CNN IBN, and the former intern. The suit seeks Rs 5 crore from the defendants, as well as ìexemplary costs and damagesî. Justice Kumar also sought an injunction against the media from reporting anything related to the complaint by the woman, and sought directions to the information and broadcasting ministry to ensure that the media ó electronic, print of the Internet ó does not report any matter except for the court orders in the case. The defamation complaint also accuses the former intern of ìvicious and gross libelî. She has not been named in the plea, and her name was given to the court in sealed cover only to enable the court to send the notice. The high court bench of Justice Manmohan Singh will pronounce order on the interim injunction plea on Thursday. During Wednesdayís proceedings, however, the judge said that the media could not be stopped from reporting the facts of the proceedings in a fair manner. Also on Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court admitted the womanís petition alleging sexual harassment by Justice Kumar, and issued notices to the retired judge and the central government on her plea for an inquiry. The woman has asked the apex court to consider setting up a mechanism to deal with such cases at workplaces within the judiciary. In the defamation complaint, Justice Kumar said that he had ìlearnt from some sections of the print and electronic media that the purported complaint by the defendant no 5 (the intern) is a product of sinister conspiracy hatched by persons who want to attack the independence of the judiciary and demoralise the courts, especially the higher judiciary, from adjudicating matters wherein corporate houses have high stakesî. The media houses ìgave effect to the intentions of the conspirators in maligning the plaintiff and bringing disrepute to his public officeî, the plea said. Kumar has also alleged that the calls for his resignation from the NGT ìevidences the malafideî and the ìobjects of the conspiracyî. The judge has alleged that he had told The Indian Express that he was unaware of the alleged complaint, and had denied the allegations when contacted by The Indian Express. Lawyers representing Justice Kumar argued that the news reports were a ìcomplete distortionî of the facts. A battery of senior lawyers, including Rajiv Nayyar, Mukul Rohatgi, Maninder Singh and former additional solicitor general A S Chandhiok appeared for Justice Kumar. ìFreedom of the press cannot extend to some point beyond reporting of facts. They scandalise the report and pull out juicy inputs so more and more people read it and TRPs can rise,î senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi argued. ìAll that a judge has is his reputation. If one day it is flashed on TV or papers that the man is guilty, the reputation is gone, the reputation of the institution is also questioned,î Rohatgi said. He also argued that the media ìhad no right to pre-judgeî, and ìa trial cannot take place in the media, it can only take place in a courtî. Since the matter raised allegations against the dignity of the judiciary, the courts could have taken it up under the Contempt of Courts Act, the lawyer said. ìThis is also a case for criminal contempt of court, but I have chosen to file defamation suit because I need damages also,î Rohatgi said. During the hearing, the court observed that the repetition of the allegation was ìdamaging the reputationî of the judge in question. ìIf you repeat the same thing over and over again, that is damaging the reputation of the person,î the court said. Advocates for the two TV channels were present in the court, and said that the press was free to report on facts. ìWe have not made any allegations but reported what was said in the affidavit by the intern,î senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi argued on behalf of Times Now. ìWho is stopping you?î the court said, and observed that the media would ìsurelyî be reporting on the hearing in the Supreme Court held earlier in the day. However, the channels have assured the court that the broadcasts of January 10, which had named the judge, would not be repeated. The court also asked the media to explain its ìintentionsî. ìWill you keep reporting in the same manner? Here are people discussing this case and naming the judge openly,î the court said. The judge, however, said that the media was free to report the judicial proceedings and the orders given by the Supreme Court. In addition, an application has been filed asking that proceedings of the defamation suit be conducted in camera ìfor the benefit of the institution of justiceî. The application states that Kumar is ìholding an important public office where public confidence in his reputation and moral integrity is of paramount importance,î and there was a ìreal and substantial risk of prejudiceî to his office if the hearing was held in open court. The plea also says that in-camera proceedings were necessary to protect the identity of the complainant. This application did not come up for hearing on Wednesday.","Swatanter Kumar harassment charge: Defamation suit in HC seeks Rs 5 crore, curbs on reporting; order on Thursday | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/crime/swatanter-kumar-harassment-charge-defamation-suit-in-hc-seeks-rs-5-crore-curbs-on-reporting-order-on-thursday/
479,"Definition of 'Baltic Freight Index' BALTIC Freight Index is a leading indicator of spot dry bulk cargo rates. It is not a shipping index, but an indicator of the bulk cargo market. Definition: BALTIC Freight Index (BFI) is a leading indicator of spot dry bulk cargo rates. It is not a shipping index, but an indicator of the bulk cargo market. It is calculated by the Baltic Exchange, based in London, a key market for the global shipping business. Description: BFI is a weighted average based on 11 international ship routes and three commodities - coal, iron ore and grain. It reflects on the freight and charter rates of these commodities on these routes. The index uses January 4, 1985 equals 1,000 as base. BFI earlier represented all freight rates for all the vessels. It was split in late 1996, to represent only Panamax vessels (70 per cent) and Capesize vessels (30 per cent) on a weighted average basis. BFI is now used for bigger ships such as Panamax and Capesize vessels. A Panamax vessel is a vessel that is capable of navigating through the Panama Canal and has a 50,000-80,000 tonnage, while Capesize vessel means the vessel can navigate through the Cape of Good Hope and carries 1,00,000-1,30,000 tonnage. BFI is more relevant for bigger ships and most Indian shipping companies such as the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), Great Eastern Shipping Company (Gesco), Varun Shipping and Essar Shipping have relatively smaller-sized vessels.

Definition: Barley is primarily a cereal grain popularly known as jau in India. It is the fourth most important cereal crop after rice, wheat and maize. It's converted into malt to use for various food preparations. Description: Barley is widely used for food and fodder. Major uses of barley are in the beer industry, food processing and feed manufacturing industries. With the rising demand for beer, the demand for barley is also picking up. Also, more than 90% of the world malt production comes from barley. Globally, some of the major producers of barley are the European Union, Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Australia and USA, forming about 75% of the world production. In India, the production has been quite stable with Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh forming the largest producers of it. Saudi Arabia is the largest importer of barley in the world. In terms of derivatives trading, it's the second mostly traded coarse cereal after corn in the global market. The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (Canada) and Sofia Commodity exchange (Bulgaria) are the most prominent exchanges for Barley trade wherein trading unit is in MT (metric ton). In India, it is mainly traded on MCX in units of 10 metric tonnes. Domestic hubs like Kota, Ramganj mandi and Baran in Rajasthan are important determinates for spot rates.

Though there is nothing unusual, a closer look reveals a striking contrast of Victorian furniture and painted ornate pillars in the studio backdrop. Another image taken in the early half of the 20th century shows a village woman carrying a vessel on her head and in the background is a palatial staircase. These images are part of an exhibition at Moon River organised by Tasveer Arts titled ìSubjects and Spaces, Women in Indian Photographyî. There are over 60 images from the personal archives of the Tasveer Foundation that comprises a collection of postcards, lobby cards, studio portraits, films stills, cabinet cards and outdoor shoots. The exhibition has been divided into four parts: domestic, outdoor, group or family portraits and performative space. Rather than a chronological representation of women, the display reflects the socio-economic progress of women through the centuries. The images are a rich catalogue of photographic work emerging from the 19th and 20th century in India. It is through these photos that we see how the representation of women (as seen from the male gaze) changed from the colonial era to Independence, from exoticised anthropological studies, to ëliberalisedí and glamorous film stars. What makes this exhibition unique is the shift in focus from photos of that era that comprised mostly portraits of men and architectural sites. ìThis bias interested us and so we began to pull out photographs with women, to see what kind of narratives and themes emerge,î says Nathaniel Gaskell, Tasveerís creative director. The studios made it possible to romanticise everyday routines, with Grecian urns and Victorian columns. The image of the woman carrying the vessel is symbolic of the juxtaposition between the subject and the backdrop, which was possible due to studio photography. Another image of a woman from South India clad in a sari shows her with her back towards the camera. It was possibly captured for an ethnographic study as it shows her silver jewellery and the South-striped silk blouse. A í40s portrait of Sarojini Naidu shows the politician seated on a chair in a lawn, looking away from the camera. In all the photos the women respond to the physical spaces that they occupy such as the studio, the outdoor and the group photo, which defines their identity, confining it or leaving it to the interpretation of the viewers. The other was the performance space, which emerged in the latter half of the 20th century. The earliest references are illustrated through the nautch girls. An undated postcard titled Nautch Wali taken in a makeshift studio in Calcutta shows a girl standing with her skirt fanned up, flanked by two musicians (on the tabla and the sarangi) on either side. The postcards, lobby cards and portraits of artistes from Bollywood from the latter half of the 20th century, add a touch of glamour and familiarity to the exhibition. An undated Nargis portrait shows her holding a cigarette, seldom seen, since female actors from that period were never depicted as smokers.† The exhibition comes full circle from showing women in a domestic setting, without expression to glamorous actors, who guard their independence fiercely. The works are on display at Moon River, D 16, Defence Colony, till† February 5.

Kajol presented the awards with Tanishaa and Kiran Shantaram, and surprise, surprise, her mother, Tanuja walked away with the award for Best Actress in a Marathi film for her role in Pitruroon. With Kajol goading her mum to give her thanks in Marathi, it was smiles all around. Later, the family mingled with the guests. A family that stays together, wins a bag load of awards together. Standing tall. Veteran actor Shatrughan Sinha could not stop talking about how great Amitabh Bachchan is, when he came to present the Lifetime Achievement Award to the legendary actor. Bachchan received a standing ovation from the industry. He said that the only way he could repay this love was if he could give the same award to the three stalwarts on stage ó Shah Rukh Khan, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Sinha. The ëawwí moments didnít stop there though. Before Bachchan left the stage, Shah Rukh bent to touch the senior†actorís feet. Presenting a protest.

When the actor was called on stage to give away the Best Actor (Female) award, with his girlfriend Preeti Desai, he used the platform to disclose the cause.

Dancing to the song Nagada sang dhol, the actor started her act on top of a Manganiyar Seduction-esque prop. The showstopper was when Padukone climbed on to a 15-odd ft wide nagada with smaller ones surrounding it. This was hoisted to 60-ft above the ground with fireworks ending the act.9. Pulling a stunt. When SRK alerted the crowd to clear out the aisles for the most dangerous act of the night, no one expected it to be this electrifying. A stunt man on a bike rode down the stage, then made his way through the crowd, jumping off a ledge straight through glass. He then made his way back to the stage with his back on fire. An action-packed way to introduce the Best Action award. Thatís a rap. A Rap artiste without a bevy of hot women by his side is not hip hop enough. And Yo Yo Honey Singh, the rising star of the music industry did not disappoint with his grand entry by riding in a convertible on stage and an entourage of women. Shah Rukh Khan asked him what his parents wanted him to become and Singh responded by crooning his biggest hits. For a newbie, Singh held his own with SRK. Award charm. The Popular Choice Award For Best Actor (Male) category was a tough one to choose a winner from with a mix of critically-acclaimed movies and blockbusters. But with Rekha as the presenter, there was no way Shah Rukh would not win the trophy. As Rekha told the crowd, the last time she presented an award to King Khan was the first time he had ever won. Maybe she was his lucky mascot she quipped. She even gave in to his request for a jig. No dagger in this cloak. Kalki Koechlin has separated from her filmmaker husband Anurag Kashyap and Huma Qureshi is being blamed for the split. Although the former has been screaming herself hoarse that the Gangs of Wasseypur actor is not to blame, but mediaís not buying it. At the Screen Awards, the two ladies walked in minutes apart.

Sharmaís film from last year, Bidesia in Bambai, captures the plight of the Bhojpuri-speaking migrants in Mumbai. With cities as the overarching theme, the films to be showcased examine issues of gender, caste, labour, inclusion, exclusion, politics and culture. The focus is on stories from developing countries, across the Global South, from Africa to Latin America and Asia. Despite the differences, problems such as homelessness and poverty are often the same. There will be films from China, Philippines, Iran and Syria among others.

But the speculation does little to faze the petite actor. She instead smiles and dismisses the claim: ìI had expected such rumours to do the rounds when I signed the film.î Seated in the Vile Parle office of Viacom 18, which is co-producing the film along with Deolís Forbidden Films, Desai explains that Bhagatís decision to cast her in the film came first. ìThis was followed by Abhayís decision to produce it, but Devika hadnít mentioned her casting call to him until he agreed to back it. It was only after he read the script that he agreed to play the lead role too,î she says. Desai, however, doesnít hesitate to admit that her beau has hugely contributed to her career. ìHeís a talented actor and being with him helped me learn more about the craft. It also gave me the chance to get my foot in the door as far as gaining access to the industry folk is concerned,î she says. When she moved to India six years ago from London after bagging the Miss Great Britain title, Desai was merely testing waters. But a three-month course in acting was followed by a career in modelling to ìkeep paying the billsî and soon, the actor ìlost her wayî.

It wasnít until she worked in Shor in the City (2011) that Desai decided to realign her priorities. It was also around this time that she and Deol started dating. ìSo, I decided to give up modelling, sat at home in order to hone my craft,î says the 29-year-old. It was tough to remain without a job and wait for the right film to come by. Yet, she stuck to her decision and spent the time visiting films sets, watching shoots in progress and cleaning up her Hindi.

So far, it was engaged in the politics of manipulation, but now it has resorted to the politics of deception and facade,î he told party leaders, urging them to remain focused on their target.

He filed cases against BJP leader Arun Jaitley, former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal and his two sons ó accusing them of unleashing a ìmaliciousî campaign to tarnish his image. Jaitley had recently written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh levelling bribery and other charges against the Chief Minister and demanded his removal. Dhumal and his sons have also released certain papers pertaining to Virbhadra Singh and his familyís dealing with a businessman. Virbhadra Singh, accompanied by senior ministers, filed the case in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (Shimla) Jyotsana Dhadwal. ìI have filed defamation case under Section 499 of IPC against Jaitley, Leader of Opposition P K Dhumal and two separate petitions against BJP MP Anurag Thakur and Arun Dhumal, sons of Dhumal,î Virbhadra Singh said after he emerged from the court. The CJM has fixed February 15 for the hearing. In the petition, the CM has said he has been compelled to take legal recourse as BJP leaders had started a personalised tirade against him and his family. This followed inquiries initiated by him into irregularities committed by the Dhumal government.†ìThis is not for the first time that I have been personally targeted by Dhumal. He (Dhumal) has always worked with a political vendetta against me. In his first term, he tried to implicate me in the Sagar Katha case. I faced the trial and was exonerated by the court. Later, the government submitted a 24-point chargesheet against me to the CBI, which gave me a clean chit,î he said. The CM emphasised that when he returned to power in 2012, there were numerous complaints against Dhumal and other BJP leaders, ìbut I decided not to continue the bad practice of political vendetta and victimisation that Dhumal had started.î ìI did not want to turn Himachal Pradesh into a Punjab or Tamil Nadu which are known for political victimisation. Not even a single case was registered against BJP leaders,î he said. ìDhumal, his sons and other BJP leaders are back to their old political tactics and are indulging in mudslinging and malicious propaganda through the media,î said Singh. The CM said he was not afraid of the ìslanderous onslaughtî by Dhumal and other BJP leaders and would face them boldly. He denied giving favours to M/s Venture Energy and Technology Ltd Company with regard to Sai-Kothi power Project but admitted having taken a loan from Vakamulla Chandrashekhar, which he said was being repaid with interest.","Virbhadra slaps defamation cases on Jaitley, Dhumal  | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/virbhadra-slaps-defamation-cases-on-jaitley-dhumal/

The victim, who was brought from Uttar Pradesh for household work, approached the police on Saturday with the help of her neighbours in the housing complex at Ghodbunder Road, where she worked for accused Sarjil Ansari (36) and Farhat Ansari (32), PI Dhanaji Kshirsagar of Mira Road Police Station said. The maid servant, whose body bore several old and fresh injury marks, was allegedly beaten up frequently over petty issues and was made to starve for days together. The Ansaris even force fed her chillies and inserted it into her private parts, if she disobeyed them, the girl alleged in the complaint. The allegations are being verified, the official said. After the girl managed to reach the cops, Sarjil, a local trader, was arrested on Sunday and produced in a local court, which remanded him in police custody till January 21.

Most states rushed to meet the deadline. While the Vijay Bahuguna-led Uttarakhand was quick to follow the decision, Mukul Sangma-led Meghalaya government appears to have rushed to meet the deadline set by party vice-president. On December 30, barely days after Rahulís directive, Uttarakhand government issued a notification exempting fruits and vegetables from Uttarakhand Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2011. Meghalaya issued a notification to exempt fruits and vegetables from Meghalaya State Agricultural Marketing Board on January 14 to meet the January 15 deadline. Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Haryana government removed fruits and vegetables from the Haryana Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961 on January 14. Uttarakhandís marketing board is estimated to suffer a loss of about Rs 8-9 crore per annum because of lifting of levy from fruits and vegetables, and Haryana is estimated to lose about Rs 40 crore.

A 51-year-old Danish woman was allegedly gangraped , robbed and beaten up at knife point by eight men inside the premises of the Railway Officersí Club, barely 50 metres from the VIP entrance to Platform No. 1 of the New Delhi railway station in central Delhiís Paharganj area, on Tuesday evening. While the woman mentioned in her complaint that she was raped for ìapproximately five hoursî, police sources said she was held captive from 4 pm to 8 pm. Several persons have been detained and are being questioned. The police claimed to have identified the accused and said arrests were likely to be made by Wednesday evening. According to the womanís statement, she was walking to her hotel in Paharganj when she lost her way and reached the State Entry Road leading to the railway station. She said the road led to a dead end, so she asked some youths if she could take another deserted road on the left. When they replied in the affirmative, she turned towards that road. Her complaint further said that when she took that road, eight men jumped out from behind some bushes and cornered her. She was reportedly dragged to an isolated spot inside the premises of the Railway Officersí Club, adjacent to the officersí resthouse building, and held hostage at knife point. She alleged that she was beaten up by the men who also robbed her of her belongings. ìThey snatched my iPod, watch, book, glasses, 750 Euros and Rs 3,000 in cash. When I tried to resist, they placed a sharp knife to my throat and said that they would kill me,î she said in her complaint. The eight men then reportedly took turns to rape her. According to her complaint, some of them even raped her twice. ìAfter approximately five hours, they let me go. I then took a tuk tuk (auto rickshaw) to my hotel,î she said. According to sources, investigations have revealed that after raping the woman, the accused climbed the wall of the club and fled towards the construction site near the railway station. Sources said one of the men even took away her jeans, and the victim had to wear his pants that were left behind. She reached her hotel, Amax Inn in Paharganj, at around 8:30 pm and informed the manager, who then informed the station house officer of the area. ìShe checked in on January 13. She told us that she has a flight to Denmark early on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday morning, she left the hotel at around 11 am, saying she was going for a walk. She returned at around 8:30 pm. She had bruises on her hands and face and was very scared. She asked us to call the manager immediately,î an employee at the hotel told The Indian Express. ìSenior police officials and some officials from the Danish Embassy came to record her statement. She was asked to go for a medical examination, but she refused to step out of the hotel. She left at around 7 am today. An Embassy official had come to take her to the airport,î said the employee. Police said the medical examination would be conducted in Denmark. ìWe have registered a case in the matter and have zeroed in on a few suspects. The investigation is on. We are in touch with the Embassy officials here in India.

What makes this case more significant than the one involving Justice Ganguly ó who resigned two days ago as chief of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission ó is the fact that unlike Ganguly, who had retired when the alleged sexual harassment incident involving him took place, the judge in this case was a sitting judge of the Supreme Court when the alleged incident took place.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) A bankruptcy judge has given final approval for the sale of Twinkies, Wonder Bread and many of Hostess Brands' other assets, clearing the way for the iconic products to return to shelves. Hostess snacks -- including Twinkies, Ho Hos, Ding Dongs and Zingers -- were sold for $410 million to a joint venture of private equity firms Apollo Global Management ( APO ) and Metropoulos & Co. They expect to return the product to store shelves this summer. Wonder Bread and most of Hostess' other bread brands was purchased by baker Flowers Foods ( FLO ) for $360 million. The company has yet to give a date for when those breads will be back in stores. On Thursday, Judge Robert Drain also approved the $31.9 million sale of the Beefsteak bread brand to baker Grupo Bimbo ( GRBMF ) , a Mexico-based company that is one of the largest U.S. bakers. None of these products have been manufactured since Hostess, which was already in bankruptcy court, went out of business during a strike by members of its bakers' union. The company has been selling off its brands since then to try to raise money for creditors. Thursday's sales account for more than $800 million. Most of the 18,500 Hostess workers lost their jobs a result of the shutdown.

There are no Davids left chasing the Lombardi Trophy, only Goliaths. Every summer, training camps open with 32 teams ó check that, the Jaguars, Browns, Raiders, Jets, and Bills were all blowing smoke at their respective fan bases ó harboring Super Bowl dreams. Only six months earlier, Ray Lewis and the Ravens finished writing a fairy tale for the ages, remember? Only a year before that, Eli Manning and the Giants shocked the Patriots again in Super Bowl XLVI. Philip Rivers and the Chargers undoubtedly would have had Pete Rozelle smiling down from parity heaven, but they ultimately betrayed the Any Given Sunday football gods in Denver on Sunday. What in the world of Roger Goodell is going on here? Arenít we entitled to cheer on a team like the Super Bowl III Jets every year or two? Why is the chalk, the four favorites, Vegasí best bets ó at the start of the season, Broncos and 49ers were +600, Seahawks +850, Patriots +1,000 via Oddshark.com ó fighting it out to get to MetLife Stadium and Super Bowl XLVIII? Well, for starters, the Broncos and Patriots have the two best quarterbacks of this generation in Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. Manning was another year removed from his four neck-fusion surgeries, so you figured his 37-year-old arm would come back stronger. And the addition of Wes Welker and emergence of tight end Julius Thomas helped Manning to a record 55-touchdown season that enabled the Broncos to withstand the loss of Von Miller and health issues of coach John Fox. But how and why are the Patriots still standing? One word: genius. One name: Bill Belichick. And he has done it all without Tim Tebow! Aaron Hernandez is out of sight and allegedly out of his mind. Rob Gronkowski was Halleyís Comet. Vince Wilfork and Jerod Mayo were lost. And Welker ran into Manningís warm embrace. It helped there was no one to threaten them in the AFC East. Both the Jets (Geno Smith) and Bills (EJ Manuel) were rebuilding, and the Dolphins had to weather a bullying storm. So Belichick got himself a first-round bye and home divisional playoff game, and Brady, at 36, still makes everyone around him better. Apparently including LeGarrette Blount, the 250-pound horse who ran over Andrew Luckís Colts. And definitely Julian Edelman, who did more to help fill the Welker void than the more-advertised Danny Amendola. It also helped Matt Schaub was throwing pick-sixes and they were burning his jersey in Houston, which was expecting its first Super Bowl championship. It helped Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome traded Anquan Boldin to the 49ers, tight end Dennis Pitta missed most of the season, the offensive line couldnít block for a diminished Ray Rice and Joe Flacco isnít Brady. It helped Andy Dalton canít win a playoff game. It helped Luck fashioned that epic comeback and knocked Andy Reid and the Chiefs out of the way. The 49ers were Super Bowl runners-up a year ago. But their best pass rusher, Aldon Smith, had substance-abuse issues. And Colin Kaepernick missed wide receiver Michael Crabtree, who was out most of the season rehabbing his Achilles. But the offensive line is arguably the best in the sport, Boldin added toughness and clutchness and Jim Harbaugh is an elite coach. It helped Matt Ryan was sabotaged by Roddy Whiteís injury issues and the early loss early of Julio Jones, and the Falcons simply werenít tough enough in the trenches. It helped the Giants made a mockery of the infamous countdown clock, Hakeem Nicks, Jason Pierre-Paul and David Wilson endured nightmare seasons, the offensive line was ravaged by injuries and Eli Manning threw the ball to the other guys. It helped RG3 was more RG-Me and Tony Romo was Tony Oh No and Chip Kelly, Nick Foles and the Eagles stole the NFC East. It helped Aaron Rodgersí broken collarbone and Clay Mathewsí broken thumb left the Packers vulnerable, and it helped the undisciplined, underachieving Matthew Stafford Lions turned into Discount Daaaable Wrecks and the Bears were anything but Monsters of the Midway with the division there for the taking. It helped Cam Newton was anything but Superman in his first playoff game. It helped Drew Brees and Sean Payton had to deal with the Seahawks and their deafening 12th Man in the divisional round. Why are the Seahawks here? Pete Carroll has made them believe. Marshawn Lynch is Beast Mode, as is the Legion of Boom secondary. Russell Wilson is a resourceful leader and winner, mature beyond his years. The Seahawks feed off their 12th Man, and vice versa. They lost in the playoffs a year ago to the Falcons in Atlanta, so they are playoff-hardened and hungry. So it will be Seahawks-Broncos in the Super Bowl. Or Seahawks-Patriots. Or 49ers-Broncos.

But hereís what Iím proposing now to Tom Brady and Peyton Manning: You want to be celebrated as The Greatest of All Time? Go win this historic New York-New Jersey Super Bowl. If Brady beats Manning and the Broncos in the AFC Championship Sunday in Denver, and then beats the Seahawks-49ers NFC Championship survivor in Super Bowl XLVIII, I will anoint him as the Greatest of All Time. And if Manning beats Brady and the Patriots in the AFC Championship, and then beats the Seahawks-49ers NFC Championship survivor in Super Bowl XLVIII, I will anoint him as the Greatest of All Time. Montanaís four Super Bowl rings and big-game excellence are beyond reproach, but allow me to explain why he is vulnerable to a coup díÈtat by Brady or Manning. Letís start with Brady. If he winds up hoisting the Lombardi Trophy for the fourth time, that would tie him with Joe Cool. It would mark his sixth Super Bowl appearance ó two more than Montana and five more than Dan Marino. Sure, he lost twice to Eli Manning and the Giants, but losing a Super Bowl (to Montana) certainly didnít hurt Marinoís Hall of Fame prospects, and losing four Super Bowls without winning one certainly didnít keep Jim Kelly from receiving a bust in Canton. Brady (18-7) already has the most wins in playoff history. Brady would be 20-7 if he wins it all. Montana was 16-7. Bradyís regular-season record is 148-43 (.775). Montana is at 117-47 (.713). Bradyís points per playoff game average is 25.48. Montanaís is 25.35. The rules, of course, favor the quarterback these days. But that argument in favor of Montana can be mitigated somewhat by the fact he got to throw to Jerry Rice and was coached by Bill Walsh. Prior to the arrivals of Randy Moss, Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez, Brady was throwing to the likes of Troy Brown, Deion Branch, David Patten and Jabar Gaffney. Joe Montana, here celebrating a touchdown in the 49ersí Super Bowl XXIV rout of the Broncos, could lose his title as best quarterback ever, writes Steve Serby. Photo: AP. Now Manning. He is to the regular season what Montana has been to the postseason. So why would I vault him to Greatest of All Time if he wins these next two games when it would improve his playoff record to a modest 12-11, with two fewer Super Bowl championships than Montana? For starters, he started 227 consecutive games before his neck fusion surgeries sidelined him for the 2011 season. Durability counts. Being there for your teammates and for your franchise every Sunday, or Monday night, counts. A Super Bowl victory with the Broncos would make Manning the only quarterback to take two franchises to the top of the football world. And beating Brady to get to his second championship would help quiet the He Canít Win The Big One crowd. Manningís remarkable 55-touchdown season at age 37 after concern his neck problems could end his career means he has been better in the twilight with his second team than Montana was with his (Chiefs). Manning is arguably the smartest quarterback to ever play. He owns a computer brain. He has been a relentless throwing machine ó 491 touchdowns in 8,452 attempts ó often forced to carry Colts teams with mediocre defenses. Being able to throw to Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Dallas Clark in a dome helped, but having Bill Belichick scheming against him all these years did not. Ask Montana, who can vouch for the genius of the young Belichick, who plotted with Bill Parcells against him in the playoffs during the Giantsí Super Bowl XXI and XXV runs. Manningís career passer rating: 97.2. Who's better: Manning or Brady? I think Elway may be better than all of them. Not only for 2 Super Bowl wins but he got to the big game 3 times with very average broncos teams which was more impressive than the 2 wins. Think about it do you think Brady manning or Montana would've done the same with no running game an average defense and the marks brothers as there wrs? I really don't think so cause they had no where near the elusiveness of elway as a runner. hey me, me...ok lets celebrate like the jets for going to the AFC Championship 4 years ago, lets sign our †big mouth coach to an extention, celebrate in the locker room like a bunch of cheerleaders because ""he"" took us to the ""game""... hey meatball the ""game"" is the Superbowl, and you have to win it, Come on New York you're better than that... and Willie, horrible logic...clearly Manning has had better weapons, clearly Manning has a better Arm...clearly Brady just wins, end of story!!! Since Spygate Bady is the WINNINGEST QB in the NFL. The Pats have gotten better. All the losers that bring it up (Spygate) fail to realize that SINCE THEN.....they have been good to enuff to go to TWO MORE FREAKING SUPER BOWLS! Get over it, the proof is in your face. They were never cheating. How do you get BETTER. Now they are 1 game from going to a THIRD SUPER BOWL. My God...... Whats amazing is SINCE ""Spygate"", Brady's winning % went from .720 to .800!!! He has not gone to ONE but TWO more Super Bowls while becoming the ONLY QB in NFL history to go 16-0. †Peter King did a study that shows that SINCE SPYGATE.....Brady and Belichick have INCREASED their winning % by 80 points, proving they never cheated in the first place. †Brady is clearly greatest ever. Winningest QB in NFL History. as Brady himself recently said in an interview and I'm para-phrasing-----""it's pointless to ever compare QBs at anytime. each one played in their own system,in their own time and place and with their own teams.it's the ultimate team sport and one can never determine who may have been better than whom""......... In my personal opinion,I just give it the eye test.I look for tight accurate spirals,a high IQ,leadership qualities,athleticism,consistency and toughness.Super Bowl rings should not ever be a determining factor,there's too much luck involved in one game. If I were to choose one really good stat,it would be MVP votes and how many times the player was in the Top 5,Top 10,etc. that's a pure sign of greatness and consistency. PLEASE!!! Take away the cheating years and what does Brady have?? He hasn't been able to win a Superbowl since then! If Manning, a man of integrity unlike Brady, was surrounded by the same talent, his stats would be untouchable! None of Brady's stats from the cheating years should even count, including his alleged Superbowl ""wins""!!!!! I think the better question is how much more successful is peyton manning if he and tom brady swap places...manning with belichick & tom brady with tony dungy. †I think the records would be reversed...manning would probably win more super bowls. †That's why the postseason records are misleading...you have to be in the right situation & system to succeed. †That's why I give the edge to Peyton Manning. Brady is awesome and a first ballot HOFer easy, but he has Belichick; and remember, Matt Castle went 11-5 when Brady went down. †I'd say Montana and Unitas over Brady and Manning. †Serby's list isn't bad. †Elway and Staubach deserve the high marks. †I think Bradshaw, Favre and Aikman are a tad too high up. †I'll take Fouts over Bradshaw any day. @ Robert Costa has Manning had all those HOFers on his teams? Montana has. Bradshaw has.has it ever occurred to you that Manning is so good,he's been able to win with just above-average rosters only to lose in the playoffs to better teams? it's just like the great ss in baseball with outstanding range that makes more errors than others because he gets to more balls.perception vs. reality. @ me me Children who only know how to reguritate ""spygate"" and ""cheating"" do nothing more than show their ignorance and stupidity, not to mention putting their jealousy on full display.† Its time to grow up child. @ me me look at TBs numbers since ""spygate""- no he has not won a SB. He's been to two. Going to another championship game; held the TD pass record until this year, has the best winning percentage, td to int ratio is incredible, has a team in the afc championship game without anywhere near the receivers manning has. Nuff ced. Manning was surrounded by talent his whole career. Marvin Harrison Reggie Wayne Joseph Addai, plus scores of other weapons. Smoke a 'Blount"" -- Lagarette Blount that is, and chill. @spragga benz†and yet,NONE of them ever took their team to 4 straight Super Bowls.but someone did. and he NEVER gets a mention when they talk about all-time greats.it's amazing to me......... wide right. @ floydfan @ me me neither one has been surrounded by great talent,they're just able to carry teams more so than other QBs. me me couldn't be any more lost if he tried.

498,"PAYDIRT! LeGarrette Blount breaks free from Colts safety LaRon Landry to score one of his four touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 43-22 victory over the Colts Saturday night at Gillette Stadium. Photo: AP. FOXBOROUGH, Mass. ó Legends arenít made by winning your first playoff game, even if you win it with a comeback for the ages. Legends are made when you stare down Bill Belichick and Tom Brady at their place, and then you go beat Peyton Manning at his place if heís still standing and then you go win the first New York-New Jersey Super Bowl. Legends are made when you show up every bit the weather-proof, pressure-proof quarterback as Brady in the intermittent rain and wind in Bradyís hostile house. Andrew Luck has emphatically reminded a hyperventilating city and a grateful franchise that, yes, there will be Life After Peyton Manning, and it shall be a long and prosperous life, filled with magic moments. Except on Saturday night, it was LeGarrette Blount who wouldnít let Andrew Luck get to his first AFC Championship Game. It was a rampaging 250-pound horse named LeGarrette Blount who sent Luck and the Colts home. It was LeGarrette Blount, a brute with speed, picked off the scrap heap by Belichick in a trade with the Buccaneers for a seventh-round draft choice and running back Jeff Demps, who rumbled inside a mashing knockout block on the right side by Logan Mankins and rambled 73 yards to paydirt with his franchise-record fourth playoff touchdown of the night, and off to another AFC Championship went to Brady and Belichick and the Patriots, 43-22 winners. Call it Blount Force Trauma. It gave the Patriots a 36-22 lead early in the fourth quarter and then Luck, who had made Gillette Stadium soooo nervous with his deep ball, threw his third interception, to Jamie Collins, and it was over. ìI didnít look at the big screen until I got free,î Blount said. ìI looked at it to see if anybody was close to catching me. Ö I was just trying to get there as fast as I could.î It meant that Blount (166 rushing yards) has six TDs in his last two games after bludgeoning the Bills for 189 yards and two TDs. ìThose guys in front of me, they donít get tired, I ainít going to get tired,î Blount said. It meant that Belichick has resurrected a career in the same way he resurrected another power back named Corey Dillon way back when. Not to mention getting the most out of Randy Moss and Blountís Buccaneers pal Aqib Talib. Brady didnít throw a single TD pass, not a one, on a night when playcaller Josh McDaniels unleashed six rushing touchdowns. ìWe feel like weíre the most physical team no matter who we play,î Blount said. Everything changed for Blount when he broke a long-standing habit and began lowering his pad level. ìI changed it because I had to ó Bill told me to,î Blount said. Actually, everything changed for Blount the day Greg Schiano informed him he was traded, and he met Belichick for the first time as a Patriot. It has been a long and winding road to get back to the AFC Championship Game for Brady, from the time Wes Welker flew away into Peyton Manningís arms, to Aaron Hernandez being thrown into jail to await a murder trial, to a cadre of inexperienced receivers who sometimes drove him mad, to Rob Gronkowski neither starting nor ending the season healthy. Brady is back anyway. LeGarrette Blount carried him back. On his back. When Luck (two TDs, four interceptions) got the game to within 29-22 on a 35-yard TD toss to LaVon Brazill, the Luck legend seemed to be in the making. Luck will be chasing a Super Bowl for a long time. A lot longer than Brady, a lot longer than Manning. It is why Brady and Belichick needed to get him now, before heís all grown. Belichick and Brady got him all right. In the end, Brady had LeGarrette Blount, and Luck did not. One quarterback 60 minutes from another Super Bowl. The other one out of Luck.","Because of Blountís heroics, Coltsí Luck runs out | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/12/because-of-blounts-heroics-colts-luck-runs-out/
499,"The main event: Patriots versus Broncos ó otherwise known as Peyton versus Tom ó in the AFC Championship Game. The undercard, the heavyweight bloodbath which follows: 49ers versus Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game. The Road to Super Bowl XLVIII and MetLife Stadium has its final stops in Denver and Seattle. If Peyton versus Tom is the friendly rivalry, then Jim Harbaugh against Pete Carroll and the 49ers versus Seahawks is the unfriendly rivalry. AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. Magic vs. Bird. Ali vs Frazier. Peyton vs. Tom. Armageddon again. It is a game Peyton Manning cannot afford to lose against Tom Brady. This is The Legacy Game. Two legacies, especially Manningís, one Super Bowl berth on the line. This is The Greatest Game. Manning has a chance to be remembered as the greatest quarterback of all time, or the greatest quarterback to win only one Super Bowl. He has a chance to be the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two different franchises, or be remembered mostly as the greatest regular-season quarterback in history. He is 10-11 in the playoffs and nothing short of 11-11 at the end of what was arguably the greatest single season (55 touchdowns) in quarterback history can save him from the slings and arrows that are certain to pierce his Adamís apple if he fails, or worse, chokes. Brady hasnít won a Super Bowl in a decade, but he has won three, which means all the pressure is on Peyton. Peyton is the greatest corporate pitchman in NFL history, but it is still up in the air as to whether he or Tom will be remembered as the greatest quarterback of their generation. Brady is 10-4 against Peyton, 2-1 in the playoffs, and this will be the latest and the greatest mano-a-mano showdown between them. If you have an appetite for a juicy subplot, Brady has a chance to avenge his Super Bowl XLII and XLVI heartbreaks administered by Peytonís Little Brother Eli. Manning endured four neck fusion surgeries and an emotional parting with the city of Indianapolis to get himself back to within 60 minutes of his third Super Bowl. He is rested following the first-round bye, but is he ready for whatever Bill Belichick and Mother Nature will have in store for him? Brady has a history of heating up in the cold. Peyton has a history of freezing. The balance of power shifted when Wes Welker left Tom for Peyton, but it may have shifted again with LaGarrette Blount emerging as the kind of smashmouth option that can keep Peyton off the field and antsy and agitated. Brady didnít throw a single touchdown pass against the Colts because he didnít need to throw a single touchdown pass against the Colts. The Broncos have been stout against the run ó Ryan Mathews (ankle) was a non-factor Sunday ó but Blount becomes the X-factor because play-caller Josh McDaniels will look to make Brady that much more dangerous by giving him balance. The Patriots have the look of a team that is peaking at the right time. The Broncos will be heartened by Knowshon Morenoís 224-yard monster rushing night in the Patriotsí epic comeback from a 24-0 halftime deficit and 34-31 overtime win two months ago in Foxborough, Mass. Defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio was interim coach for that one while John Fox was recovering from a heart procedure. When he coached the Panthers, Fox lost a Super Bowl to Bill Belichick. The Broncos wonít have the disruptive Von Miller this time, so there will be more of a pass-rush burden on Shaun Phillips and Malik Jackson. On the other hand, Brady wonít have tight end Rob Gronkowski to throw to, so running back Shane Vereen will undoubtedly get more opportunity. Brady will be encouraged by the way Philip Rivers and Keenan Allen shredded the Broncos secondary in the fourth quarter. Much will be made of Danny Amendola not filling Welkerís shoes, but it has been Julian Edelman who has helped fill the void. Bradyís epic comeback was aided by Del Rio losing cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie on the last play of the first half with a shoulder injury. Brady completed 34-of-50 passes for 344 yards, 3 touchdowns and no interceptions, while Manning was 19 for 36 for 150 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Of course Tom was better: the wind chill was six degrees. The game was decided on a fluke play: Tony Carter ran into Ryan Allenís punt after it bounced, Nate Ebner recovered at the Broncosí 13-yard line, and Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 31-yard field goal with 1:56 left in overtime. Demaryius Thomas figures to be more of a factor this time, although heís likely to be shadowed by Aqib Talib, the classic big cornerback required to match up against the big receivers. Welker (4-41) and Eric Decker (1-5) will almost certainly be more involved, and for the first time since the Dallas Clark days in Indianapolis, Manning will have the advantage at tight end in Julius Thomas. Peyton vs. Tom. Tom vs. Peyton. The heavyweight championship of the quarterback position. The heavyweight championship of the other. NFC CHAMPIONSHIP. Hide the women and children. The Seahawks hate the 49ers. The 49ers hate the Seahawks. This enmity is such that this one now rivals, if not exceeds, Ravens-Steelers. And weíre not even counting the postgame handshake between Carroll and Harbaugh, which could be as physical as the game itself. Harbaugh, when he was the Stanford coach, tried a 2-point conversion late in a 55-21 beatdown of Carrollís USC team at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 2009. That prompted Carrollís famous, ìWhatís your deal?î postgame greeting for Harbaugh, and Harbaugh responding, ìWhatís your deal?î When Harbaugh seemed to tweak the Seahawks for five PED player violations, one of the culprits, cornerback Brandon Browner said: ìHeís never going to be out there lined up against me. I wish he could. Iíd wring his neck.î Golden Tate, who had been fined $21,000 for an illegal blindside hit on Sean Lee, said: ìI would try to give him the Sean Lee treatment.î Seahawks Richard Sherman and Doug Baldwin played for Harbaugh at Stanford. Following the Seahawksí victory over the Niners in September, Sherman charges Harbaugh ignored him after the game. Harbaugh said it wasnít true. ìI guess sportsmanship doesnít go both ways,î Sherman said. They might as well play this one in the parking lot, without shoulder pads and helmets. This is a throwback game that likely will be decided in the trenches Ö or by which quarterback, Russell Wilson or Colin Kaepernick, is more resourceful. This is a testosterone-fueled Machismo Bowl that will require vigilance by the officials, coaches, trainers, team doctors and independent neurologists to prevent it from being remembered as a Concussion Bowl. This is Harbaugh and the 49ers-against-the-world, an ear-splitting world where the Seahawksí 12th Man will be an odds-on favorite to set a new decibel record at CenturyLink. Standing up to Marshawn Lynchís ìBeast Modeî will demand the defiant, belligerent 49ers defense show up in full Beast Mode itself. Much will be made of the 49ers being out scored 71-16 in their last two visits to Seattle, but Kaepernick did not have Michael Crabtree and Anquan Boldin together in those games. This is why Kaepernick says: ìThatís in the past.î The Panthers were so obsessed with taking away Crabtree, back from his Achilles injury, Boldin notched his fourth 100-yard game in his last seven postseason games. Hard to believe Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome traded Boldin away for a sixth-round draft pick. Boldin is a snarling, clutch gladiator who will be seen jawing and woofing back at the Seahawksí intimidating Legion of Boom secondary, the best and most boisterous in the land. Kaepernick also has tight end Vernon Davis at his disposal, by the way. The 49ers are dangerous not only because of their physical toughness, but because of their mental toughness as well. Remember, this is their third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance. Wilson will need to be better than he has been over the last month, but he better not be counting on receiver Percy Harvin to ride to the rescue if the Saints game is any indication. In the Seahawksí 42-13 demolition of the 49ers late in 2012, Wilson threw four touchdown passes with one interception and was rushed six times for 29 yards while Lynch rushed 26 times for 111 yards and a touchdown. Kaepernick was 19 for 36 passing, good for 244 yards, one touchdown, one interception and rushed seven times for 31 yards. It should be pointed out Seahawks hulking safety Kam Chancellor knocked Davis (concussion) out of the game in the first quarter. Running back Frank Gore (6 carries, 28 yards) was invisible. In the Seahawksí 29-3 dismantling of the 49ers in September, Kaepernick was 13-of-28 for 127 yards and three interceptions and had nine carries for 87 yards. His passer rating? 20.1. Gore was 9-16 rushing. Sherman limited Boldin to a single catch for seven yards. Davis was 3-20 receiving. ìWe are not going to win games if I play like that,î Kaepernick said afterward. Lynch, meanwhile, was carried 28 times for 98 yards with two touchdowns and was on the receiving end of a third touchdown. Wilson completed 8 of 19 passes for 142 yards, one touchdown, one interception and had 10 rushes for 33 yards. The 49ers extracted a measure of revenge with a 19-17 victory last month at Candlestick. But this game wonít be at Candlestick. Harbaugh owns a 6-3 head-to-head edge over Carroll ó 4-2 in the pros, 2-1 in college. It's nice to see the four best teams, although the Patriots are debatable. Both games are very compelling. Two classic offensive AFC teams and two blood and guts NFC teams. Both matchups are full of side stories and have the potential to be classic games. The super bowl should be a classic boxer/puncher matchup. Let's hope the weather is good, and cold, and there are no serious injuries to the two finalists. @ opaque/971bbbb8-31a9-11e3-ba92-000f20980440 LOL what a loser, did you hear Adam Schefter speak about the giants today , how lucky they where to get those two SB†wins, and everyone made ELI out to be this elite QB when he isn't even close, Giants got lucky in both game everyone knows it but you idiot Giant fans, you should be thanking David Tyree's helmet and Wes Welker for those superbowl wins. @ opaque/971bbbb8-31a9-11e3-ba92-000f20980440 A couple of lucky plays is not ""having their number."" †At least your Giants are enjoying some golf and warm weather this time of year.

500,"Definition of 'Beta' Beta is a numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market. Definition: Beta is a numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market. Description: Beta measures the responsiveness of a stock's price to changes in the overall stock market. On comparison of the benchmark index for e.g. NSE Nifty to a particular stock returns, a pattern develops that shows the stock's openness to the market risk. This helps the investor to decide whether he wants to go for the riskier stock that is highly correlated with the market (beta above 1), or with a less volatile one (beta below 1). For example , if a stock's beta value is 1.3, it means, theoretically this stock is 30% more volatile than the market. Beta calculation is done by regression analysis which shows security's response with that of the market. By multiplying the beta value of a stock with the expected movement of an index, the expected change in the value of the stock can be determined. For example , if beta is 1.3 and the market is expected to move up by 10%, then the stock should move up by 13% (1.3 x 10) . Beta is the key factor used in the Capital Asset Price Model (CAPM) which is a model that measures the return of a stock. The volatility of the stock and systematic risk can be judged by calculating beta. A positive beta value indicates that stocks generally move in the same direction with that of the market and the vice versa.",Beta Definition | Beta Meaning - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/beta
501,"Definition of 'Block Deal' Block deal is a single transaction, of a minimum quantity of five lakh shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore, between two parties. Definition: It is a single transaction, of a minimum quantity of five lakh shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore, between two parties which are mostly institutional players. The transaction happens through a separate trading window. The deals happen in the beginning of trading hours for a time span of 35 minutes. Description: Block deal order consists of the following attributes: 1. An order may be placed for a minimum quantity of 5 lakh equity shares or minimum value of Rs 5 crore. 2. Every trade has to result in delivery and ""Block Deal"" orders cannot be squared off or reversed. 3. The price of a share ordered at the window should range within +1% to -1% of the current market price/previous day's closing price, as applicable. 4. Transparent disclosure of trade transaction details such as the name of scrip, name of the clients (Buyer and Seller), quantity of shares bought/sold, and traded price have to be made by the broker to the exchange immediately. The exchange has to furnish all the transaction-related information to the public markets on the same day of the block deal transaction, after the closing of trading hours. For example , two FIIs (foreign institutional investors) want to trade 10% of a company's total number of shares. As this transaction involves trading of a large quantity of shares, the risk factors entailing to this transaction are immense. Thereby, the exchange on which trading will happen, allocates a separate trading window for these two investors to exhibit a block deal, with the prime focus of prohibiting risk.",Block Deal Definition | Block Deal Meaning - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/block-deal

503,"The age-old tradition of schools issuing character certificates will soon be replaced by aptitude certificates in Gujarat, said Chief Minister Narendra Modi during his inaugural address of the National Education Summit held at Gandhinagar on Friday. ìWe are trying to bring in a little change to the age-old tradition, perhaps introduced during the British rule. When we leave a school, we are given a character certificate and wherever we go we show the same character certificate. Ironically, none of those accepting it understands its requirement or utility,î he said. ìI have made this suggestion known to my colleagues and work is in progress regarding this. There should be a facility, where children will undergo regular observation and monitoring while in school. With the help of technology, their daily routine and family members will also be put under observation.î Debunking the existing system of field visits, he said students should be taken to visits to army camps, industries, manufacturing companies. ìDo we need to pass a resolution in the Parliament and make a law for this,î Modi said, while addressing representatives from 33 states and Union Territories, including more than 100 vice-chancellors and directors, 84 scholars and more than 1,500 professors and teachers.

504,"Related. Refusing to grant interim relief to unaided recognised schools in the city, the Delhi High Court declined to grant a stay on a notification issued by Delhi Lt-Governor on nursery admission. The notification states that children living in 8-km radius of the schools will be given a preference during admission, which is set to begin from January 15. ìThe matter requires detailed hearingÖ it cannot be stayed on the first day..î Justice Manmohan observed, while dismissing the plea for interim stay on the operation of the December 18 notification issued by L-G Najeeb Jung. The order comes after the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools had filed a plea claiming that the notification was ìabsolutely illegal, arbitrary and without jurisdictionî. The new guidelines for nursery admission for the session 2014-15 had allowed the 100-point scheme for nursery admission to continue, but had specified that 70 points would be given to children who lived within an 8-km radius of the school. The government notification also abolished the 20 per cent management quota, and allotted a 20-point preference to applicants who have a sibling studying in the same school. Further, five points will be added by default in the application of girls and wards of school alumni. During arguments before the court on Friday, Senior Advocates Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Sandeep Sethi argued that the notification was made without application of mind, and compromised the autonomy of schools. ìThe Ganguly committee had said you cannot restrict people to one area. Giving 70 points out of 100 points to neighborhood (criteria) is arbitrary,î the advocate said. The court, however, said the matter would need to be heard in detail. ìThis academic session, you can go on with this notification, we will see for next year,î the court observed.

The ASER reports over the years, starting 2005, show how under the UPA, school enrolment has improved impressively and now faces just last-mile issues. With enrolment over 96 per cent for children in the age group 6-14 in 2013, and in fact consistently in the range 95-96 per cent for the last five years, getting children to school is one key result area where this government has delivered.

516,"A day without an A-Rod bombshell is like a banana split without whipped cream. It leaves you unfulfilled. So when no big news hit the public domain on Tuesday, we were left to take a breath and reassess where everything stood in the matter of Alex Rodriguez v. The World. Letís catch up on some of the big storylines and offer some additional observations. 1. A-Rodís latest lawsuit. On Monday, he filed suit against Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association in the hopes of vacating the 162-game suspension he received Saturday from independent arbitrator Fredric Horowitz for his involvement with Biogenesis, the shuttered South Florida anti-aging clinic. The defendants have 21 days from the suit filing to file a response, so MLB and the union both face a Feb. 3 deadline. We have heard repeatedly Rodriguez has no chance to prevail in this matter. On Monday, I heard the most dumb-guy-friendly explanation yet for this. Thanks to Matt Adler, chair of the International Litigation and Arbitration group with the law firm Pepper Hamilton. Adler read Team A-Rodís lawsuit, and he noted paragraph 103, which reads: ìArbitrator Horowitz demonstrated a manifest disregard for the law by admitting into the arbitration record and relying upon unreliable evidence, wholly unauthenticated documents, and hearsay testimony.î In a telephone interview Tuesday, Adler responded to that assertion: ìYouíre allowed to do that in arbitration. When you sign a contract that creates the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, the technical evidentiary rules of a federal court do not apply. Therefore, to base your appeal on the violation of those rules makes no sense.î This would be the equivalent, Adler said, ìof grafting soccer rules onto football.î During the arbitration hearing, Team A-Rod repeatedly lamented it would be dominating in a federal-court hearing. Unfortunately for Team A-Rod, it canít magically transform its case away from arbitration. 2. Horowitzís ruling. Admittedly, when I read Horowitzís write-up on Monday ó generously provided by Team A-Rod, as an exhibit in its lawsuit ó I was taken aback by how strongly Horowitz rebuked Team A-Rod and the Players Association and validated MLB. I wondered whether the severity of the language actually could help Team A-Rod affirm its argument that Horowitz carried a bias. Then again, I had never read one of these before. It turns out, based on conversations I had Tuesday, my reaction fully reflected my inexperience. While not all rulings are so definitive, it isnít uncommon, either. Furthermore, one attorney with experience in MLB pointed out Horowitz wrote up his explanation in such a way that it comes off as a preemptive strike against subsequent litigation. Horowitz goes into vast detail about the genesis of his reduction from 211 games to 162 games plus the postseason. 3. A-lone. Itís worth noting, as he seems determined to leave himself friendless in the baseball world, Rodriguez is extremely untethered from the industry. His baseball agent, Dan Lozano, has not been at all involved with Rodriguezís Biogenesis battle. When Rodriguez had a conference call with the Yankees during the arguments about his health last summer, A-Rod used attorney Jordan Siev as his counsel. He has plenty of legal representation, have no doubt. One independent attorney, taking note of the nine Rodriguez attorneys identified on Horowitzís report, offered the ballpark guess that A-Rod has paid $5,000 per hour for legal representation. The non-baseball attorneys are simply doing their jobs. Itís not necessarily their concern whether Rodriguez alienates everyone else associated with MLB. But Rodriguez really could use someone in baseball to offer a different take. Lozano didnít return a call on Tuesday. 4. The spring thing. The feeling down in Tampa is Rodriguez ultimately will not report to spring training. Team A-Rod insists he will be there. ìHeís going to train to come back, whether thatís in April 2014 or April 2015,î Rodriguezís attorney Joseph Tacopina told me on Monday. There have been suggestions that because Rodriguez isnít on the Yankeesí 40-man roster as a suspended player, he will be relegated to the minor-league complex. The Players Association, despite being the latest Rodriguez target, will nevertheless work to protect the sanctity of the collective bargaining agreement, which is hilariously vague on this issue. Precedent has been that players who were beginning the season on a suspension for illegal performance-enhancing drug usage ó think the Metsí Guillermo Mota in 2007 and Oaklandís Bartolo Colon and San Diegoís Yasmani Grandal last year ó showed up in major-league camp. However, none faced a season-long ban. The Yankeesí ticket sales are down in spring training, just like the regular season; they have increased their billboard presence in Tampa to push their Grapefruit League contests. We all know that, if Rodriguez actually played in a game, Steinbrenner Field would sell out. So come on. Make this happen, Yankees.

517,"CHARLOTTE , N.C. ó If it hadnít been for Kyle Williams fumbling a punt against the Giants two years ago, or Ray Lewis leading his Ravens on an emotional journey to the Super Bowl last season, we might be using the ìDî word to describe Jim Harbaughís 49ers. A third straight trip to the NFC Championship Game is plenty impressive, but before they can be called a dynasty a Super Bowl victory has to be part of the rÈsumÈ. Itís something they hope to accomplish this season. ìWeíre healthy and weíre a great team,î running back Frank Gore said, moments after the Niners dismissed the Panthers 23-10 Sunday afternoon in a divisional playoff game at Bank of America Stadium. ìWe are willing to do whatever it takes to get this ring.î San Francisco travels to Seattle Sunday with the winner advancing to Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. The 49ers become the first team to return to the NFC Championship Game the season after losing a Super Bowl since the 1977 Vikings, offering an idea of how unique their trifecta is. ìWe didnít finish last year,î said Gore, who rushed for 84 yards. ìNow weíre back. We have to go to Seattle. We know itís going to be a dog fight. But weíre built for this.î If Williams hadnít fumbled that punt to set-up the Giants game-winning field goal in overtime and if theyíd beaten the Ravens in New Orleans, the Niners might be going for a Super Bowl three-peat and comparisons would be made to the 1960s Packers, the 1970s Steelers, the Cowboys of the 1990s, the Patriots of the early 2000s, and those Niners teams of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. Instead, they are an uncrowned dynasty eager to capture the goal that has eluded them thus far. ìOur teamís excited to have this chance, the ultimate chance,î Harbaugh said. ìWeíll be ready.î The Niners were ready for the Panthers. They were too talented, too tested and too smart. Carolina was playing its first playoff game of the Cam Newton era and the post-season inexperience showed. The Niners beat them up physically, rushing for 126 yards and staging two goal-line stands. They began imposing their will just before the end of the first half. The Panthers also couldnít match the Niners mentally. They spent too much time talking trash and drawing foolish penalties. ìWe played right up to the edge,î said receiver Anquan Boldin, who caught eight passes for 136 yards. ìYou donít want to hurt your team, but theyíre out there taking swings. Thatís stupid.î Carolina was coming off a bye and had won 11 of its last 12 games, including a 10-9 victory over the Niners in November. The Panthers were supported by a vocal crowd and perfect weather. But it was the Niners who thrived in the environment. ìWe have been in some tough environments the last two weeks,î Bolin said including San Franciscoís win at Green Bay. ìWe came out victorious and thatís a credit to these guys on this team and the coaches on this team. Weíve been there and so that had a lot to do with the way we handled ourselves.î Harbaugh referred to his players as ìmighty menî for beating a good team on the road. Itís becoming a habit. ìIf youíre in a playground basketball game, you want your team to have as many competitors on the court as you possibly can,î the coach said. ìI feel like weíve got the most competitors.î Beating the Seahawks in Seattle will be a more difficult challenge. But the Niners are nothing short of confident. ìThis is our third straight trip to the NFC championship,î said safety Donte Whitner, ìand weíve seen every quarterback in the NFL. Weíve seen every offense; weíve seen star players and weíve played in big games. We understand what it takes to win big games.î",Harbaughís confident Niners ëexcitedí for shot at crown | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/12/harbaughs-confident-niners-excited-for-shot-at-crown/

Shuttlesworth) and Norris Cole (Cole Train) on his way to a team-high 32 points in the Netsí double-overtime win. Photo: Charles Wenzelberg. It seems a foregone conclusion the Heat and Pacers will wind up meeting each other in the Eastern Conference finals later this summer. With everyone else struggling to achieve mediocrity, the Heat and Pacers have been the class of the talent-challenged conference. Their dominance had reduced the regular season into a necessary exercise to occupy time until the playoffs arrive. But Heat vs. Pacers to decide which team faces the Western Conference champ in the NBA Finals doesnít seem as inevitable now that the Nets and Knicks look to be getting their acts together. When the local teams were in the throes of awful starts to their respective seasons, making the playoffs wasnít a given ó much less actually being able to compete with the two-time defending NBA champion Heat in the playoffs. But the Knicks have no reason to fear the Heat after beating them 102-92 Thursday night at the Garden for their third straight win over Miami and fourth in five games. Now the Nets have earned some swagger after beating the Heat 104-95 in double overtime Friday night at Barclays Center. It was the Netsí fifth straight victory in 2014 and their second over the Heat this season after a 101-100 victory way back on Nov. 1. ìItís tough in this league,î Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said of the Heatís back-to-back losses in New York. ìItís tough coming off success and itís tough coming off failure. [We] think the competition is getting better. By the time we get to the spring, our game has to be at a different level.î The Nets (15-21) have taken their game to a different level. But he Heat played without Dwyane Wade, Mario Chalmers and Shane Battier, and LeBron James fouled out in the first overtime after scoring 36 points. Nevertheless, the Nets earned their victory and continue to show improvement despite playing without Brook Lopez and Deron Williams. ìFor my guys to fight for 58 minutes, it was a win we needed,î Nets coach Jason Kidd said. Players wore nicknames on the backs of their jerseys and it was JJ, Big Ticket and Truth leading the Nets. JJ, as in Joe Johnson, started off by scoring 22 of his 32 points in the first quarter, while Kevin Garnett (12 points, 10 rebounds) and Paul Pierce (23 points) kept up the kind of intensity ìKingî James and J. Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen) could not overcome. ìIt was a gutsy win,î Johnson said. ìWe were very resilient.î It might have been a regular season game, but it was a reminder the Nets, like the Knicks, could haunt the Heat in a playoff series. Itís why Spoelstra went into the game turning up the sense of urgency to leave Brooklyn with a win and change the Heatís New York karma. James tried to rally Miami late but wound up fouling out for the first time in a regular -season game since 2008. ìWe played the right basketball at the end of the game,î Nets forward Andrei Kirilenko said. Spoelstra saw first-hand Thursday night how the Knicks have improved their play. He saw Friday night how the Nets have improved theirs. ìTheyíre playing with more confidence now,î Spoelstra said. ìThe season is a long season. When they were going through their struggles and everybody was ready to make strong conclusions about them and everybody else in the Eastern Conference, I just rolled my eyes. It was way too early and way too premature. ìThey have a lot of talent and they were going through a lot of adversity. But things can change. All of sudden you get confidence, you get continuity, your outlook changes. Everything can change in a snap of a finger.î The Heat are gearing for the playoffs. But with the Knicks and Nets looking improved, maybe the matchup in the Eastern Conference finals isnít such a foregone conclusion after all.","A night after Knicks, Nets show Heat not invincible | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/11/a-night-after-knicks-nets-show-heat-not-invincible/
519,"GREEN BAY, Wis. ó Jim Harbaugh tried more than once to get Colin Kaepernick to wear long sleeves for the 49ers wild-card playoff game against the Packers on Sunday night at Lambeau Field. With the wind-chill at minus-10 degrees at kickoff and expected to drop to minus-20 before the game finished, Harbaugh figured his quarterback could use the extra insulation. But Kaepernick told his coach, ìIíve played in colder,î referring to his college career at Nevada. ìI feel like itís more mental than anything. Iím a little hard-headed at times.î Going sleeveless showed the quarterback born in Milwaukee and raised in California wasnít going to give in to Mother Nature, nor would he give in to the Packers and Aaron Rodgers in one of the toughest environments anyone could face. Amid the frigid temperature and with a Lambeau record playoff crowd of 77,525 at full throat, Kaepernick lead the 49ers on a game-winning 14-play drive that ended with a 33-yard field goal by Phil Dawson as time expired. It gave the 49ers a 23-20 victory and sends them into a divisional playoff against the Panthers next Sunday in Charlotte. ìTo put a drive together like that under any conditions is big time, but especially today with all the factors working against us,î said Dawson, who had three field goals in the game. Kaepernick might have been called clueless if heíd gotten frostbite and performed miserably in the cold. Instead, his coach was using words like ìclutch, tough and greatî to describe his quarterback, who completed 16 of 30 passes for 227 yards with one touchdown and one interception and also ran for 98 yards on seven carries. ìSomebody that answers in the clutch time of the game, on the important down, on the time when it matters most, thatís what I would call clutch,î Harbaugh said. ìHeís Kaepernick tough, and I think itís pretty awesome.î It worked out well for the 49ers, but there were several times Kaepernick could have been the goat. He burned a timeout on the first play of the third quarter when he left his play-coded wristband on the sidelines. And his game-winning drive almost ended prematurely when a sideline pass to Anquan Boldin was nearly intercepted by Packers cornerback Micah Hyde. But there was enough brilliance by Kaepernick to outplay Rodgers (17 of 26 for 177 yards and 1 TD). A 42-yard run in the second quarter set up a touchdown run by Frank Gore and a perfect 28-yard dart between two defenders to tight end Vernon Davis in the fourth quarter rallied the 49ers into a 20-17 lead. And on his game-winning drive, Kaepernick completed passes of 11, 17 and 11 yards, before scrambling for 11 yards to the†Packers 27 to convert on third-and-8. ìI was trying to go to [Michael] Crabtree one-on-one, but it didnít look good to me so I tried to make something happen,î Kaepernick said of his scramble that ultimately positioned Dawson for his game-winning kick. Kaepernickís poise under pressure didnít surprise his teammates. It was the sixth game-winning drive of his young career and the fourth this season. ìWhen we needed a play he got it whether it was throwing the ball or running,î said Gore, who rushed for 66 yards. ìHeís a tough guy. A quarterback like that youíll do whatever for him.î Kaepernick insisted he wasnít affected by the weather, which made it the seventh coldest game at Lambeau since 1959 and the fourth-coldest postseason game ever at the storied stadium. Now the 49ers head to Carolina to face the Panthers, who defeated San Francisco 10-9 on Nov. 10. Kaepernick threw for just 91 yards and ran for only 16 yards in that game.",Dynamic QB Kaepernick sleeves Packers in his dust again  | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/06/dynamic-qb-kaepernick-sleeves-packers-in-his-dust-again/
520,"Jerry Reese made it clear what he thought about the Giants 2013 season. ì7-9 sucks,î he said Monday as players cleaned out their lockers at the teamís training facility following a 20-6 win over the Redskins on Sunday. At least the general manager is already on the same page as his coach and owner. Reese, Tom Coughlin and John Mara all expressed their disappointment with the Giants missing the playoffs for the fourth time in five years. But itís Reese who is charged with making the necessary changes and upgrades needed to contend for another Super Bowl. This easily will be the most challenging offseason of his seven-year tenure as the general manager as he faces a lengthy list of decisions that will need to be right for the Giants to be winners again. The first task is to evaluate the performances of his coaching staff and players. He said he ìabsolutelyî wants Coughlin to return as the head coach, but stopped short of endorsing the return of the entire staff. ìUntil we talk to the head coach about those things itís inappropriate to talk about that right now,î Reese said. In addition, the general manager must address the 23 unrestricted free agents on his roster, including players such as defensive end Justin Tuck, defensive tackle Linval Joseph and running back Andre Brown. Reese also must identity free agents from other teams the Giants might want to pursue. Then thereís the upcoming draft, which the Giants need to be a success to address areas like the offensive line, running back and cornerback. Thatís the hard part. Reese had the magic touch early in his tenure, especially in 2007 when nearly all of his draft picks played a role in winning the Super Bowl. But the Giants havenít been getting the same type of production from their middle- to late-round selections in recent years. Other than first-round pick Justin Pugh, who started all 16 games at tackle, the Giants didnít get a lot out of their 2013 selections, and the 2012 draft hasnít produced much with first-round pick David Wilson proving fumble- and injury-prone, and second choice Rueben Randle developing slowly at wide receiver. Marvin Austin, a defensive tackle taken in the second round in 2011 is long gone, while fourth-round pick, James Brewer was unimpressive during his play at offensive guard this year when injuries forced him into the lineup. If you go by the theory it takes three years to properly evaluate a draft, 2010 was not a winner. Jason Pierre-Paul and Joseph, the top two picks, are potential stars, but none of the next five picks are on the team. That is why the Giants have no depth. ìI donít think anythingís wrong with our system and how we draft players,î Reese said. ìBut obviously weíll evaluate that as well.î Reese has two Super Bowl championships on his resume offering the kind of security that allowed him to take some risks drafting players that needed development. Players such as Pierre-Paul and offensive tackle Will Beatty were drafted without a deep football background. But that might have to change. With the need for players to step in and be competitive right away, an NFL source said the Giants and other NFL teams may have to start drafting players primarily from the power conferences like the SEC, the Big Ten and ACC. ìTheyíve already played in big games,î the source said. Mara all but put Reese on notice when he said, ìPersonnel-wise, I think we obviously overvalued certain people. I think we have not gotten the production that we wanted out of certain draft slots.î Yet Reese said he has total confidence his personnel department can find the right players to upgrade the talent. ìWe have good personnel people in our building and weíve done it well enough to win a couple of Super Bowls,î he said. True. But the NFL is a ìwhat have you done for me latelyî league. And the Giants havenít done much at all. The running backs are fine, but they need blocks. The Giants need a new and strong O line. And they can afford it by getting rid of epileptic Eli. I think we're tired of his inability to read the field. He has an awesome deep ball, but that's all he's got. Anything under 40 yards gets thrown to the wrong team. And he should take the old man with him, he's too soft anymore. It was a good run...c'ya. And do whatever is needed to keep the D right where it is. Plus a corner or two. While I'll give Jerry that nobody could have seen the things that happened to guys like Steve Smith, Kenny Phillips, JPP,Terrel Thomas all good selections who got hurt and haven't been the same or are done with their careers already. I've said for years now that the draft day philosophy is flawed, due to ignoring linebackers, my point was validated when they added Beason and the defense got better instantly.Jerry has had a lot of misses in the later rounds and I'd imagine that not very team has had the success that Seattle has had in the later rounds. 8 of their 11 starters on defense against us were 4th round and beyond selections.I don't pay a whole lot of attention to what other teams do, so maybe they have been equally lousy in the later rounds?Jerry has added some nice free agent pick ups as well as some free agent busts. I know around the league Jerry is highly regarded, so come on Jerry work some magic. Free agent spending may not be a big option this off season, but if we could take a serious run at Alex Mack(center) and or Moreno at running back it would open up the draft for Offensive tackle, and move Beatty to guard, I'd say Pugh to guard but why move the kid after playing so well where he was.Then take your pick, another o linemen, CB, LB, WR.lots of holes to fill Jerry, nobody can really expect you to fill them all this year. The game is a receiver league now, that's why you need pass blockers and great receivers---go get Josh Gordon, dump Nicks please. This guy tanks it in a walk year, don't even think about bringing him back. Watching Nicks is like watching Cano run to first on a ground out---LAZY!!! JPP is another one who is a one year wonder, another stiff in a long line of stiffs. LT #56 had the heart of a lion, these guys are just happy to take the Mara's money, dumping them would be the best move the Giants could make. JPP never reaches his potential, mark it down!!! Manning needs to be in a system that makes quick reads and short drops. He isn't mobile enough to take a deep drop and stay in the pocket. He's pretty much shell shocked back there now, he could be ruined. I've never seen a QB who got hit before he got hit, this guy falls and twists with the best of them. No wonder his streak of games played is intact. Yea, I'm bitter!!! Because Eli-te teased us in '11 when he had a really good if not great year. I'm thinking this guy figured it out and we have him for the next five to seven. He made great decisions with the ball that year, WHAT HAPPENED? How could he fall so far, so fast? STOP with the 2 SuperBowl comments. The game changes rapidly and you're getting left behind. One game against the Seahawks in a playoff scenerio Jerry and your team gets beaten by 50 points.You never give a straight answer to anybody and you hid from the media for 7 weeks this year. You alweays think your evaluation and selection of players can compete for the title. WRONG!..You put 2nd-3rd string linebackers on the field Jerry until you traded for a former all pro who has 2 knees made of fiberglass...you got lucky on that one and I hope he comes back. You sent this team to San Diego with 1.5 healthy corners while 3 other teams signed veteran replacements that same weekand, expected McBride who wouldn't start on any teams to cover Gates.You have kept Kuhn and Robinson on this roster for God only knows how long and paid them for doing close to nothing except rehab. You keep Matt Dodge on the roster and pay him for doing absoltely nothing. You keep thinking that David Wilson is a solid talented running back..He isn't Jerry..he is a ""runner"" there is a heck of a difference. Just look at Louis Murphy who you signed this year. You sign Beatty who got beaten time after time this year. You just paid this guy 28 million for a guy who might not even be a starter on 90% of any teams in the league. You always say ..""this is a crap shoot...you win some you lose some"".. .Really Jerry? Please explain to me how the Patriots are in the playoff hunt and even the SuperBowl hunt every year whether they have numerous starters fall or not?...every year no matter what.

521,"It will take a lot of persuading and a lot of money to get Floyd Mayweather to fight anywhere but the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. But insiders insist there remains a possibility the pound-for-pound king of boxing could be holding his next bout at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Mayweather is tentatively scheduled to fight sometime this spring in what would be the third bout of his six-fight deal with Showtime. The problem is selecting an opponent that will generate the kind of pay-per-view revenue that will earn everyone a profit. He dispensed of his most attractive opponent last September when Mayweather scored an easy decision over Mexicoís Saul ìCaneloî Alvarez. The pay-per-view bout did record-setting numbers generating $150 million on 2.2 million pay-per-view buys. But it may have left the cubboard bare as to quality opposition in future bouts. Amir Kham and Marcos Maidana have been speculated as possible opponents for Mayweather. But nothing is signed. Investors need upwards of 1 million pay-per view buys to break even and having the fight at the Barclays Center could create added interest. ìIt would be like LeBron coming to town,î a source close to the situation said. ìIt would light up the Barclays Center.î A Mayweather bout at the Barclays wouldnít generate the type of gate that could be made in Las Vegas and there are tax issues that might deter Mayweather from fighting in New York. But the media exposure he would receive could equate into enough added pay-per-view revenue to ensure his guarantee. Mayweather is clearly partial to fighting in Las Vegas, his hometown. But he seemed open to taking the Mayweather Experience elsewhere as long as his minimum guarantee is met. ìMy guarantee will never be under $32 million, never,î he told Fighthype.com. A Mayweather fight in the spring is one of several bouts to look forward to in 2014. The boxing schedule begins next weekend when Canadaís former world champions Jean Pascal and Lucian Bute battle from the Bell Centre in Montreal; and on Jan. 25 Mikey Garcia faces Juan Carlos Burgos in a junior lightweight title fight at the Garden Theater. HBO will televise both bouts. Meanwhile, Alvarez is expected to return on March 8 against Alfredo Angulo of Mexico at the MGM, while Manny Pacquiao is set to fight April 12 in Las Vegas against a yet to be named opponents. More locally, the final boxing card ever at the famed Roseland Ballroom is set for Feb. 12 when Broadway Boxing features ìThe Last Dance.î Bouts on the card will see New York fan-favorites Heather ìThe Heatî Hardy, an undefeated super bantamweight and West Point graduate junior middleweight Boyd ìThe Rainmakerî Melson in separate eight-round bouts. Here are a few main courses I also would like to see in 2014: Adonis Stevenson vs. Sergey Kovalev for the unified light heavyweight title fight; Gennady Golovkin vs. Andre Ward at super middleweight; Peter Quillin vs. Danny Jacobs for the middleweight title; and Miguel Cotto vs. Sergio Martinez at a catch weight. Mayweather is signed with Showtime, while Pacquiao is loyal to HBO though he doesnít have a multi-fight deal in place. Further complicating matters, Pacquiaoís promoter Top Rank and Mayweather are sworn enemies though the Pac camp says Top Rank boss Bob Arum, ìwould not get in the wayî of a Mayweather fight. Pacquiao has agreed to drug-testing and taking less money, but the probability of Mayweather-Pacquiao in the fall could hinge on how well Mayweatherís fight in the spring does. A poor PPV showing in his bout against Robert Guerrero last May earned just 850,000 buys and cost Showtime $8-$10 million. That prompted the rush to match him in the ultimate money-maker against Alvarez last September. Another disappointing PPV result in his upcoming fight this spring could add more urgency to a match with Pacquiao.",Mayweather may fight at Barclays | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/11/mayweather-may-fight-at-barclays/

523,"At least 16 people have been killed and 40,000 have fled their homes after torrential rain triggered flash floods and landslides on Indonesiaís northern Sulawesi island, officials said on Thursday. Rivers on the islandís northern tip overflowed and burst their banks, sending torrents of water surging through the city of Manado and surrounding areas that swept away poorly-constructed houses and vehicles. People waded through waist-deep water to get to safety, while some took to rubber dinghies to escape the rapidly rising flood waters. Many of those displaced took shelter in government buildings and churches in the Christian pocket of Muslim-majority Indonesia. Rinto Talib said the flood waters surged suddenly into Manado, the main city in North Sulawesi province, causing people to ìpanicî. ìI saw at least six cars belonging to my neighbours swept away by the powerful waters,î said the 52-year-old, adding it was ìthe worst flooding that has ever happened in my lifeî.

525,"THEATER REVIEW. Beautiful -- The Carole King Musical. The author of stone-cold boomer classics like ìOne Fine Day,î ìThe Loco-Motionî and ì(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,î pop genius Carole King was a shoo-in for a Broadway jukebox. On Sunday night, it arrived: ìBeautiful ó The Carole King Musical,î which clearly hopes to score as big as ìJersey Boysî and ìMotown.î Thereís just one hitch: King had no taste for booze or drugs and wasnít involved in either mob deals (a la ìJersey Boysî) or sexual shenanigans (ìMotownî). Instead, she married her baby-daddy ó and musical collaborator ó Gerry Goffin when she was 17, toiled 9 to 5 writing songs in a Midtown cubicle, moved to the íburbs, divorced and achieved personal happiness and solo fame. Her songs may be great, but whereís the drama? The problem is King didnít have any ó something which ìBeautifulî handles in two ways. The first is the inspired casting of its star, Jessie Mueller. Though she won accolades for ìThe Mystery of Edwin Droodî and a Tony nod for ìOn a Clear Day You Can See Forever,î Muellerís hardly a household name. But her engaging, moving performance here should make her one. As written by Douglas McGrath, the character is a bit of a doormat: a self-effacing, self-deprecating Brooklyn girl whoís baffled when the tortured Goffin (Jake Epstein) decides he wants an open marriage. But Muellerís King, whoís onstage almost all the time, is no sap. Instead, this funny music nerd radiates intelligence. Whether sheís a frumpy, late-í50s teen or a hippie in flowing dress for 1971ís ìTapestryî ó when the show opens and ends ó she always comes across as a gifted artist in love with creating. Mueller sings with aching, honest emotion ó stripping all the potential cheesiness out of ìYouíve Got a Friend.î The other way ìBeautifulî deals with its subjectís lack of histrionics is by playing up Goffin and Kingís affectionate rivalry with fellow songwriters Cynthia Weil (the terrifically acerbic Anika Larsen) and Barry Mann (Jarrod Spector, last seen as Frankie Valli in ìJersey Boysî). Doubling up on couples is a nice idea, and Jeb Brown injects welcome gruff humor as their publisher/producer, Don Kirshner. But the book is often heavy-handed, and Marc Bruniís production only occasionally resurrects the bubbly verve and energy of those glorious songs. Derek McLaneís bilevel set displays near-industrial practicality, but Brian Ronanís sound design is mediocre at best. The originals snapped and popped, but here the music feels muffled in cotton. Worse, the producers skimped by using synth strings in the orchestra instead of real ones. Not only does this sound cheap, but thereís actually a plot point about how King wrote her own string arrangements! And yet ìBeautifulî also strikes genuine grace notes ó thanks to Mueller. When she sings the first lines from ìWill You Love Me Tomorrow,î the song and the moment feel timeless.",Carole King musicalís star a ëBeautifulí Broadway jewel | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/13/carole-king-musical-a-beautiful-broadway-jewel/
526,"Ever wondered why we havenít had dinner in ages even though youíre really fun, I love you dearly, and wouldnít it be great to get together during the holidays? No, itís not because you enjoy a glass or 10 and Iím a teetotaler. Itís because you enjoy a glass or 10 and then you suggest we split the check. Thanks for putting me in this lose-lose situation: Either Iím a cheap spoilsport or I get screwed. The third option only sucks a little less, and itís the one Iíve picked: Like a coward, Iíve opted out without telling you why. Thatís right: Now I avoid both shame and undue expense by not going out with check-splitters anymore. Sorry, Karen, Nick and Tom, Iím done subsidizing you. (Oh yeah, names have been changed to protect the oblivious guzzlers, soakers and lushes). Letís say weíre at Perla in the West Village. Some at the table are sure to raid the bar. Glasses of wine start at $11.50. Thereís a lonely $40 bottle on the list ó but somehow itís never the one that gets picked. Next thing we know, that innocuous-looking subsection for the alcohol tab is in the three figures. Yet when the bill comes, someone blithely says, ìLetís split it, itís so much easier.î Rest assured itís always one of the drinkers who thinks itís so much easier. Alcohol is a well-known danger to math skills. You can point out that you drank tap water and youíd prefer it if everybody paid their share. That makes you the designated cheapster, annoying everybody with unnecessary calculations. New apps like Billr, Tab and Plates have made the process easier, but they donít help with the psychological warfare: Volunteering your phone to figure out the check fairly still turns you into the buzzkill who just snuffed out the party. For years, I put on a brave face while seething inside, then pulled out my credit card and paid for my bloated share of the Chateau Selfish that everybody else had enjoyed. To those who say, ìBig deal, it will all work itself out in the end,î I can only answer: No, it wonít. Iím not going to start drinking, so how is it going to work out in the end? Despite growing up in France ó in a wine-making family! ó Iíve never developed a taste for alcohol. I just donít care for the stuff. And Iím not going to eat two entrÈes to make up for my part of the check. I donít mind being around drinkers, but I do mind subsidizing them. This used to be worse when I was out of college and on a budget. I have a bit more money now, so I could easily pay my share of a split bill laden with $15 cocktails. But for me, itís not about money, itís about fairness. The only time Iím fine with splitting the check is if itís someoneís birthday and weíre treating ó plus going in knowing the deal makes it all easier to swallow (so to speak). Bill-splitting is such a touchy subject that game theorists have come up with something called ìthe unscrupulous diner.î If you go in knowing that the check will be split evenly, you will eat and drink more. If you know you will pay your share, you will think twice before ordering that extra bottle of Barolo. And this applies not just to non-drinkers, because bill-splitting gives headaches to a whole bunch of people. Iím sure the craze for small plates has wrecked friendships, for instance. The food seems like an excuse to sop up wine, and you end up forking over good money for a microscopic bite of caramelized cauliflower and half a goat-cheese ball. This is grating, but somehow less annoying than the booze problem. You just have to be the first one to the (small) plate. Vegetarians are in a similar rickety boat filling up with resentment ó after all, a salad costs a fraction of a steak. As for me, my New Yearís resolution is to finally stand up for myself. Just because I donít want to split the bill doesnít mean I should also split off from my friends. And maybe Iíll order that porterhouse for two after all!","Instead of splitting the check, this teetotaler will just split | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2013/12/23/instead-of-splitting-the-check-this-teetotaler-will-just-split/
527,"THEATER REVIEW. Cirkopolis. Unlike the Big Apple Circus and Ringling Bros., the Montreal-based …loize has no animals, and it favors theaters rather than big tops or arenas. Its shows, like the new ìCirkopolis,î combine extraordinary athletic feats, ensemble choreography, intricate projections and original music. Shades of Cirque du Soleil? Yes and no. …loize is more intimate and less cheesy than its fellow Canadian circus. But there are crossovers between the two ó ìCirkopolisî choreographer and co≠-director Dave St-Pierre worked on Cirqueís ìZumanityî and ìLove.î …loize was last seen in New York with the lovely ìRain,î which played the New Victory back in 2005. Eight years is a long absence, but the wait was worth it. ìCirkopolisî takes place in an oppressive environment of machines and office drones. The men are all dressed in gray suits, with fetching colored ties and pants cuffs; the women sport bright í50s-style dresses. Among the cubicle dwellers is a clown-like MC (Ashley Carr and FranÁois Saus≠sus, alternating) who links the various acts. But itís best not to overthink the concept, and simply relax and gasp at the performersí gravity-defying exploits. Weíve seen them all before ó juggling, trapeze, balance, contortions, teeterboard ó but these guys are on a whole other level. It seems that everything is more: more difficult, more daring, more ambitious. Take the juggling. Itís not just that dozens of pins are flying in the air simultaneously ó itís that the entire company, a dozen strong, ends up participating in the number. No one does group stunts like …loize. And yet individuals shine as well. Dominique Bouchard seems to have a telepathic connection with his diabolo ó a juggling device in which he uses two sticks linked by a string to manipulate a spool. Angelica Bongiovonni delivers a dazzling Cyr wheel number, teasing the large, heavy ring as if it were alive. Then she jumps on it and executes a series of figures at high velocity around the stage in a spot-on mix of grace, strength, balance and visual elegance.

530,"MUMBAI: London-based publisher Bloomsbury has withdrawn a book by Jitender Bhargava in response to a case filed by former aviation minister Praful Patel who the book blames for the national airline's weak financial health. ""If the contents of the book have caused any embarrassment to Mr Patel, we sincerely regret the same and it was never our intention to discredit him in any manner,"" Bloomsbury, publishers of famous books as the Harry Potter series, said in a public notice. The book, 'The Descent of Air India', published on October 11, chronicles the financial troubles of Air India. It claims that its mammoth deal to buy 111 planes in 2005 and 2006 with Boeing and Airbus and the merger with erstwhile state-run domestic carrier Indian Airlines lead to Air India's troubles. The book squarely blames Patel, currently the minister for heavy industries and public enterprises, and Air India's former chairman V Thulasidas for these decisions. Air India has been making losses for seven years and has been surviving largely on equity infusions from and loans backed by the Indian government . Patel said he will not pursue the matter further now that Bloomsbury has apologised and withdrawn publication of the book. ""Bhargava has no face. If he decides to re-publish a book written on personal vilification, let him go ahead,"" he said. Bhargava, a former executive director at Air India, said the book has sold enough copies to spread the message he wanted to convey. ""A lot of people have already read it. There was a reprint. If someone wants to read more, I have copies lying at home,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Bhargava posted the news on his account on social networking site Facebook . He added that ""the decision of Bloomsbury was unilateral, and without discussing with me, as an author . Their stand thus naturally came to me as a surprise"". Bhargava reiterated that ""everything stated in the book is true, based on documents"", and said he will have the book reprinted ""either on my own or through a new publisher"". Bhargava also said he plans to bring out an e-book in the next four to five weeks. He said a chapter from the book has been incorporated by Prashant Bhushan of the Aam Aadmi Party in a petition filed with the Supreme Court against Air India's aircraft acquisition. The petition incorporates, among other things, a 2011 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General which also blames the airline's plane purchase as the reason for its beleaguered state.",Bloomsbury withdraws book 'The Descent of Air India' blaming Praful Patel - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bloomsbury-withdraws-book-the-descent-of-air-india-blaming-praful-patel/articleshow/28860338.cms
531,"Related. 2014 will see new entrants in the banking sector and the RBI is also pushing for alternative banking channels,such as white label ATMs,to bring unbanked areas under its fold. With more than half the country still unbanked or financially under-served,RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had urged banks to think out of the box when it comes to financial inclusion and not just limit themselves to opening bank accounts. <U+0093>Innovation in reaching out to the under-served customer,rather than simply posting higher numbers in branches or bank accounts opened,has to be part of our efforts,<U+0094> he had said on November 15. Innovation will certainly be the name of the game in 2014 that will see new entrants in the banking sector as well as the possible rise of a host of alternative banking channels to make formal credit mechanisms more accessible. White Label ATMs,innovative techniques for doorstep banking and pre-paid cards for making purchases,money transfers and even saving for pensions are on their way to make formal banking more accessible for a country where just 35 per cent of adults have access to a formal bank account and eight per cent borrowed formally in the last 12 months. The findings,which are a part of the World Bank Findex Survey 2012 also reveal that only two per cent adults use a bank account to receive money from a family member and only four per cent use an account for payments from the government. In 2014,White Label ATMs could possibly be a game changer in the area of financial inclusion. Of the 13 companies licensed by the RBI for WLAs,Tata Communications Payments Solutions has already begun operations while Muthoot Finance is set to launch early next year. <U+0093>We have applied to the RBI for final approval,which is likely by the first week of January. So,we shall start rolling out ATMs 30 to 45 days after that,<U+0094> said KR Bijimon,chief general manager,Muthoot Group,which plans to set up 9,000 such ATMs within three years of operations. Meanwhile,Tata Communications Payment Solutions,which launched WLAs under the brand Indicash in June 2013 plans to deploy 5,000 such devices by June 2014. <U+0093>We have already set up 600 WLAs in Tier III cities and below in states including Maharashtra,Kerala,Karnataka,Delhi,West Bengal. Most WLAs are witnessing reasonable number of transactions,<U+0094> Sanjeev Patel,CEO,Tata Communications Payment Solutions Limited had said. White Label ATMs are typically unbranded automated teller machines that do not belong to any particular bank. Proposed by the RBI in June 2012,they provide banking services to domestic customers of all banks through debit,credit or pre-paid cards for cash withdrawal,balance inquiry or mini-statements. The central bank<U+0092>s intention is to improve penetration of ATMs in the country,which are close to 1 lakh in number but are predominantly deployed in Tier I and II cities. Industry estimates reveal that India is lagging behind and has just 98 ATMs per million of population compared to 211 ATMs in China for every one million people. Accordingly,RBI has directed that a majority of WLAs must be deployed in Tier III and lower cities. <U+0093>We have a good presence across the country and will use it to expand the scope of WLAs. Even if we do not earn much profit from it,we will consider it as a part of out financial inclusion efforts,<U+0094> said Bijimon. Muthoot,which has partnered with FIS and Federal Bank,estimates that to break even,every WLA must have 80 to 100 customers every day. The transactions will not be charged to customers but to banks. Even Patel agreed that transactions at WLAs may not be sufficient for most operators to break even and put the onus on banks to open more bank accounts. <U+0093>We can keep putting such ATMs but banks also need to do their job and open more bank accounts as well as hand out cards to customers,<U+0094> he said. In the interim,Tata Communications Payment Solutions is also looking to tie up with companies to provide value added services such as bill payments,advertising,sales of other products and remittances at these ATMs. Innovation,will certainly be a game changer as financial institutions and NBFCs also explore other avenues such as pre-paid cards to channelise savings of the poor and those living in remote areas. For instance,Invest India Micro Pension Services has tied up with Visa to provide pre-paid card based micro payment solutions to take deposits for pensions. <U+0093>It<U+0092>s as simple and reliable as a mobile phone recharge,<U+0094> said Gautam Bhardwaj,co-founder and managing director,IIMPS,which started out providing pension solutions to the remote Paniyan tribe in the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu and now boasts of over 7 lakh customers across 14 states. Using mobile technology,these subscribers can transfer their pension contributions to an escrow account from where it is invested in approved products. In return,the subscriber gets a text message,confirming that his or her money has been safely deposited. Muthoot,too is foraying in a larger role in the pre-paid card segment with a money transfer facility that is aimed at migrant labour. <U+0093>We are already providing pre-paid cards to over 20,000 customers who can use it at specified stores where Muthoot has tie-ups. We are now repositioning it as a money transfer card,<U+0094> said Bijimon. The NBFC,which is already engaged in transfer of foreign remittances,will position the new facility at migrant labour across the country.","This new year,RBI wants more banks for your buck | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/this-new-year-rbi-wants-more-banks-for-your-buck/
532,"I wrote a book with the subtitle: ìHillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless .<U+2009>.<U+2009>.î Unfortunately, I wrote it in 2005 and published it in 2006 ó and my answer to the ìunlessî wasnít Barack Obama, but Rudy Giuliani. My book did about as well as it deserved to do. Still, its central contention ó that Hillary would be the 2008 Democratic nominee ó was entirely uncontroversial when I wrote it, when I published it and for a year afterward. And it would be entirely uncontroversial now for 2016. This time she comes into the race with seemingly insuperable advantages: The best-known Democrat besides the president, she has every benefit of her last name and none of the disadvantages and is revered by many in her party. But all that was true before 2008 as well. So let me caution everyone else against making the same assumption in 2014 that I made in í05 and everybody else made in í06. If Mrs. Clinton were a Republican, political history suggests sheíd very likely be the nominee, because the GOP has a long history of picking ìthe next guy in line.î (Ronald Reagan came in second for the nomination in 1976, then won it in 1980. The elder George Bush finished second in í80 and won in í88. Bob Dole was No. 2 in í88 and the nominee in í96; John McCain, second in 2000 and the nominee in í08. Mitt Romney, basically the runner-up in í08, won the nomination in í12.) Only twice in the past 50 years has someone whoíd never run before carried the GOP banner: Barry Goldwater in 1964 (lost) and George W. Bush in 2000 (won). Not so for the Democrats. George McGovern got the nomination in 1972 out of nowhere, as did Jimmy Carter in í76. Michael Dukakis hadnít run before he was the nominee in í88, nor had Bill Clinton when he won in í92. John Kerry in 2004 and Obama in í08 each won on his first try. Only three times in the past half-century has the Democratic next-in-line secured the nomination, and in each case, the party failed to take the White House: Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Al Gore in 2000. So history is actually against Mrs. Clinton on the basis of her inevitability. Democrats tend not to like veterans of the presidential race running for the highest office and donít like to pick the obvious choice. Nor, it seems, do voters in the general election. Yet you canít beat someone with no one, which is why the underground Clinton campaign is doing everything possible to make it seem sheís the inevitable choice, and to keep others from considering a run. But thereís never ìno one.î Someone will challenge her. The two obvious possibilities are Vice President Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, the new, left-populist senator from Massachusetts who has positioned herself as the friend of the consumer and the enemy of the banks. Itís hard to see the logorrheic Biden making it all the way through to the nomination without blowing himself up. And Warren may be able to raise money like crazy, but her appeal outside the Northeast and MSNBC left is unclear. So who else? In the past week, riding out of the West, the Hillary spoiler has appeared on the horizon. He is Brian Schweitzer, the ex-governor of Montana. An expert on energy policy, a former rancher and soil engineer, heís disarming and funny, and he knows how to talk in an interesting way about issues because heís from a purple state where Democrats donít dominate. Heís considering the run. Heís been to Iowa. Heís a new face to many Democrats, whoíll discover that heís as populist as Warren and as vociferously anti-war as Howard Dean ever was. There may be other non-Hillarys to emerge, but Schweitzerís a pretty good model. And there will be one. Hillary Clinton wonít sail to the nomination.

""We have already now appointed a new CEO for the Saudi operations, and we are planning to launch the Saudi operations anytime between the middle to the third quarter of this year,"" Akbar Al Baker said in an interview. Baker, speaking on the sidelines of the Bahrain International Airshow, said those issues had now been resolved, though he did not give details. ""There is a compromise that has been accepted by the authorities regarding the price cap and the fuel price."" Saudi Arabia started opening up its aviation market in 2012 by awarding additional carrier licences. Population growth and rapidly rising incomes mean there is considerable room for expansion, analysts believe. Currently, only Saudi Arabian Airlines and budget airline National Air Services serve a domestic market of about 27 million people. Foreign carriers can only fly in and out of Saudi Arabia, not within the country. Qatar Airways has previously said its Saudi domestic carrier will be called Al Maha Airways and will start with main cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, before moving to second-tier cities. Earlier on Thursday another new airline, Saudi Gulf Airlines, said it had signed a $2 billion deal with Canada's Bombardier Inc to buy 16 CSeries jets with options for 10 more. It aims to start operating in the Saudi domestic market later this year or next year. INDIA. Airlines in the Gulf have also been exploring ways to expand in India's market. Last November India's Jet Airways closed a deal to sell a 24 percent stake to Abu Dhabi's Etihad. Baker said Qatar Airways was discussing the possibility of sharing flights with two Indian airlines . ""We are talking to IndiGo and SpiceJet to do codeshare agreements,"" Baker said. ""We were with Air India and we had to stop it half-way, because they are showing interest to join the Star Alliance.

534,"DETROIT: South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co , already struggling with a host of business challenges, is developing another headache: a dearth of product to compete in a fledgling US mini-crossover utility vehicle market even as rivals gear up for a big push. This adds to Hyundai's challenge in making significant market share gains in the United States, where it has a smaller presence in the SUV segment than its rivals. A Hyundai executive said this week at the Detroit auto show that the company's share of the US market, its second biggest globally, will likely improve to 4.7 percent this year from 4.6 percent in 2013. Excitement over the promise of a market for small ""subcompact"" crossover utility vehicles (CUVs) is mounting in the United States. General Motors Co said it expects sales of its own Buick Encore subcompact CUV and other mini SUV-like vehicles by other automakers, including those offered by luxury brands, to reach 400,000 vehicles a year in 2018. ""I am really excited about the potential,"" McCormack told Reuters in an interview this week at the Detroit auto show. ""The idea is ... I can get that functionality (of crossovers) but I don't need to do it in a bigger vehicle necessarily. Now, I think it fits a lot of people's lifestyles very nicely."" Yet, according to four individuals close to the company, Hyundai won't likely have an answer for that expected growth in the foreseeable future. ""It looks more and more like Hyundai is going to completely miss the boat with mini crossovers at least for the foreseeable future,"" noted one of the knowledgeable individuals who are privy to Hyundai's global product plans but asked not to be identified. He said it isn't that Hyundai isn't searching for a solution, but there is ""no answer so far."" Dave Zuchowski, the recently appointed US chief executive of Hyundai, said the automaker plans to boost its crossover and SUV business as part of a mid-term effort to reach a market share of 5 percent. But Hyundai has no immediate plans, he noted, to come up with a model to compete in the subcompact CUV market. Instead, it plans to focus its sales and marketing effort on bigger CUVs that it already markets, namely the Tucson compact and the Santa Fe midsize SUVs. Hyundai is ""definitely looking at"" the subcompact crossover market, Zuchowski told Reuters on Monday at the show. ""There are a lot of activities going on there right now.

The first batch of students of the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) at Bana, a remote township close to the China border in East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh, will be sitting for the Class X board exams this March. It may also be the schoolís last batch. The school was one of 100 such schools set up across the country by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs under Article 275(1) during the ninth five-year plan. It began its academic session in August 2009 with 54 students in Class VI, selected from various districts of Arunachal Pradesh based on a competitive examination. While they were all promoted to the next class the following year, the authorities could not admit new students in Class VI because no new teachers were appointed. The reason: lack of funds. According to the EMRS guidelines, the expenses for infrastructure and stipend óamounting to Rs 43,000 per annum ó are to be borne by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs, while the state government is required to take care of the salaries of the teachers and non-teaching staff. The school only has five teachers and six non-teaching staff. ìAn agreement signed by the state government in May 2009 had entrusted Vivekananda Kendra with the task of managing the school. We have continued to serve because we cannot deprive the children of their education,î said V Omanakuttan, principal of the school. The Vivekananda Kendra has been paying the staff a nominal sum as salary. ìYou cannot call it a salary. It is more like a remuneration for voluntary work. The rules say the state government has to meet our salary expenses, which also includes other allowances,î said Omanakuttan. ìIt is very sadÖ I have gone from pillar to post in the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs to get the sanctioned Rs 16 crore for establishment of the school. But only Rs 7.5 crore has been released so far. Moreover, the state government forgot to meet the salary expenses of the staff,î said local MLA Tani Laffa. The plight of the school only came into focus during Chief Minister Nabam Tukiís recent visit to Bana, over 370 kilometres from Itanagar. Tuki ordered creation of a corpus fund for payment of salaries.

536,"There are three questions about Bill de Blasio. First, and most obvious, is how he will do as mayor when it comes to the things that really matter ó providing basic services, maintaining public order, keeping the citizenry safe. Second, and most important to de Blasio, is how effective he will be at implementing his activist agenda, with its emphasis on somehow altering the nature of the cityís economic and social ìinequality.î Third, and most fascinating for the future, is what the success or failure of his mayoralty may mean for the country as a whole. De Blasio may be the most left-wing politician ever to win a major executive office in the United States, and as a result of the rules laid out in the City Charter, New Yorkís mayor is an exceptionally powerful official. Itís therefore logical to think that de Blasioís mayoralty will be a test case. His success or failure will provide crucial guidance to the Democratic Party and to the nation about the viability of unabashed left-wing governance. Or will it? Living as New Yorkers do inside the famous Saul Steinberg illustration in which Manhattan eats up seven-eighths of the United States, weíre always inclined to believe that whatís happening here is more important politically than what is happening anywhere else in America. The thing is, weíre almost always wrong about that. In point of fact, New York is and always has been sui generis ó a political case unto itself. This is, after all, a famously liberal city with a tiny number of Republicans that had been run by center-right mayors (elected on the GOP and minor-party lines) for 20 uninterrupted years. Then, in November, a candidate preaching radical change won the mayoralty in a colossal landslide ó even as a majority of those in the exit polls actually professed satisfaction with the status quo. Thatís just weird, and should demonstrate once and for all that New York is a wildly idiosyncratic city whose politics and politicians are basically non-transferable. Indeed, not since Theodore Roosevelt became vice president in 1900 has a major local politician gone on to do anything of consequence nationally ó and TR wasnít even an elected city official, but rather a one-time police commissioner who only became veep after winning a term as governor of the state. Roosevelt left the job of top cop in 1897. That was 117 years ago, if you need help with the math. Since his day, not one mayor or high-ranking city official has even gone on to win statewide in New York, not for governor and not for senator. After the wildly successful mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani altered the dynamic of American cities by demonstrating it was possible to reverse crime sprees and reestablish public order ó and after 9/11 made Rudy a national hero ó many people believed heíd figured out how to crack the national political code. Here was a nationally famous and even revered politician with a proven record and cross-party appeal. Yet his presidential bid in 2008 was a disaster, as Mayor John Lindsayís bid had been in 1972. Perhaps the issues Bill de Blasio raises as mayor will help guide his party later on ó or perhaps his failure will scare his party away from them. But as history suggests, itís far more likely that what happens in New York City will stay in New York City, as it almost always does. What's wrong with the idea of changing one's own income inequality by getting a job and working hard to succeed ? Certain segments of our society have become accustomed to whining and crying racism, then asking for a handout and living off of those who work. De Blasio is their messiah. Radical governments seldom work. They tend to be administratively clueless, disorganized, and so ideologically driven that they flub any serious problem. A few acceptable appointments as commissioners cannot obscure the fact that lower ranks will be politically chosen radicals, as I predicted here: http://www.georgesarant.com/2013/10/the-ny-city-commune-of-2014.html. Nyc is doomed!. More crime more social programs, at taxpayers costs for the ingrates that elect not to work. Prices in retail stores will go up due to more and more slugs will be boosting items, and no recourse but to pay the high prices. Less police, municipal workers getting screwed on their pension and health benefits. More projects will be built. Property taxes will go up to pay for other useless social programs. The exodus has started, and will not end till commissar debalsio vacates from†office. Detroit here we come!. I am very Conservative, but the thing people are forgetting is why was De Blasio Elected in the first place? He was Elected because his ""Two New York's""†addressed a concern that millions of people have, which is not ""Rich Versus Poor"" (most people if they are working on a decent job, and do not have to worry about high prices and punitive taxes, do not have time to care about that),†but that far too many people have been left behind, and that problem has been ignored by politicians from Obama down. Think about it, instead of creating jobs for Americans and immigrants already here, the ""solution"" to the job problem†is bringing in more people. What does that do? Drive wages down, make finding decent housing more difficult (and expensive), and stretch Social Services, and overcrowd schools. Do I think his approach will work? No I do not. But I give him credit, for addressing an issue that needs to be faced. Free is a nice term used by the Left that means someone else will pay for it. The way someone else pays for the Free stuff is for their taxes to go up. NY State is already losing population, which is evidenced by the fact that Florida will soon pass NY State in population, dropping NY to fourth place in overall population. What DiBlasio doesn't quite get is the Detroit at one time had a population of over one million people, in the early sixties it also had the highest standard of living in the nation. Detroit is the product of fifty years of Liberalism. When it began it's march downward it economy was still strong, Not so much with New York State or New York City. New York State is already experiencing population loss since 2010. Start raising taxes and NYC may go to that path as well. DiBlasio came into office with a laundry list of freebies, with an idea that the very people who could pack up and leave the fastest would pay for it. This nothing more than a recipe for disaster. Deblasio is dangerously delusional and insane, as are the new city council members. Despite 20 years of evidence under Bloomberg and before that Giuliani here comes DeBlasio in his Che Guerva beret telling us everything we've seen was a mirage. And somehow, this narcissistic hack Deblasio is so smart we should take him seriously. He's serious all right. Like a heart attack. @ FrankyCrisp nothing Franky - the problem is that making your life better through your own efforts requires determination and perseverance and hard work.† it is just too easy to skip all that and demand that others give you things to better your life.† Progressives (hate how they grabbed that term) do not in any way appreciate or advocate for the ideas of personal responsibility.† Their politicians use class warfare and accusations of racism (or really any ism) in order to gain power.† Those who vote for them appreciate the easy win of food stamps / housing vouchers / subsidized phones / etc. Our fight against progressives like De Blasio is not merely a political one but also one that has extreme consequences for the future of America.† They don't care about the unintended consequences of raising taxes or increasing regulations on businesses.† They don't care about the debt they foist on us at all govt levels with the magic number of 17 trillion standing out at the federal one. The GOP in NYC is useless and the one in Washington speaks well during elections but just goes along with the Democrats / Liberals / Progressives ins spending us into catastrophe. We are in very serious trouble if a man with a past like Deblasio's can be elected to lead a city of over 8 million with annual operating budgets of over $70 Billion. @ David Brown DeBlasio was elected because over two-thirds of the voting population of NYC could not be bothered to register a vote against him! In effect, the 75% of (less than) 30% who actually voted-- this†majority of a tiny minority!--†gave the monstrosity known as DeBlasio†carte blanche†to destroy their city.† This speaks more to the laziness and/or stupidity†of the NYC voting public than it does to DeBlasio's message. @ David Brown What is often left out of the conversation is why people are being left behind. In the overwhelming number of cases those ""left behind"" are born to unwed mothers who have sex with men they hardly know. As a teacher and guidance counselor †for nearly 20 years at top rated NYC schools, these children, in most cases grow up without the proper structure, examples of proper work ethics, often have moderate to severe emotional issues of abandonment †and have medical issues related to parental drug and alcohol abuse during pregnancy and their early childhood years. These children drastically†underperform †other children in the same school including immigrant children who are still learning the language . Anyone who has suffered a loss of a family member understands the emotional duress and how it affects your ability to learn. Many of these children face this stress and pressure everyday and learning is the last thing on there mind. When they become adults, the lucky one end up working in low paying jobs due to the lack of skills and the lack of the knowledge you need to succeed such as showing up on time for work each day and giving 100%. What is the solution. Strongly denouncing rearing a child out of wedlock. Parenting class and support to those who had the misfortune of having a baby out of wedlock. Promotion of birth control and bring to the attention of the public the harm done to children when †the child is not born out of love. I have come across parents outwardly speak bad of there child because it looks like there bastard faster. @ Dennie Why not the welfare slugs can leave their six kids with four different fathers to get high without any accountability. They will be free to vegetate on the streets. Spending tax dollars on useless slugs that will not work. @ Dennie Who could argue with providing extra help for those in need, especially children. It cost far more to take care of someone in jail or on public assistance their whole life then to educate them. †The problem is that many people on public assistance don't properly parent there children teaching them the basics such as self control, tying there shoe's, nothing worth it comes without hard work and perseverance or even potty training their children. †These are things that can't be learned in school. The reason many schools are chaotic in some NYC areas is that the so called parents drop off their kids and provide and treat schools as baby siting services. †Many of the †children have no social training and those who do are stuck with children who divert the teachers time from teaching and nurturing to dealing with outburst of unruly children. The thing that Deblasio knows and the average person in the public does not is that free pre-k is available for most low income people already and it is the middle class who are paying through the nose for day care. @ Dennie Most studies show that the benefits of such early pre-K progams are minimal at best, and any benefits are lost by grade 2. So yeah, free day care is what it amounts to. Also, a money grab and another class warfare attack.† But hey, what heartless, mean spirited rich†person would begrudge paying higher taxes†for the kids?

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Vinod Kumar Binny on Thursday described Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwalís style of functioning as ìautocraticî, and alleged the party was now working at the behest of the Congress. At an explosive press conference outside his home, Binny repeated the charges he had made on Wednesday, accusing the Delhi government of having failed to fulfill its promises. He added that if no amends were made in the next 10 days, he would sit on an indefinite protest fast at Jantar Mantar from January 27 along with ìlike minded people, including from within my own partyî. Binny, however, said he would not quit the party, of which he was a ìloyal soldierî. And it would be unfortunate if the party were to expel him for raising issues that were important to the people. Two hours after Binnyís outburst, party leader Yogendra Yadav responded to his charges. Yadav said Binny was reading from a ìBJP scriptî, and announced disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against him. He accused Binny of spreading untruths because of ìpersonal issues†that he hadî, and dismissed Binnyís charges as the result of the grudge he nursed for not being given a ministry, and ìdiscouraged from applying for a Lok Sabha ticketî. Binny, who had raised the banner of revolt after the Delhi cabinet was announced on December 25, said, ìThat Arvind Kejriwal and Sandeep Dikshit have a long friendship is something that the world knows and I am aware of as well.

They are now required to pay these huge amounts, and this must be waived,î Binny said. The governmentís rider to its promise of free water was ìdhokhaî (deceit), Binny said. ìThey first said that people of Delhi will get 700 litres of free water per household, but never said that people will have to pay for all 701 litres if they exceed the limit even by one litre. They said that the Jan Lokpal bill would be passed within 15 days, and action would be taken against corrupt leaders. Where is the woman commando force for the city that was to ensure safety? All these issues have been ignored.î Attacking Kejriwal directly, Binny said his government was ìtanashahiî (autocracy). ìThere is no room for dissent and everybody is just supposed to nod along. Kisi ko bolne ka mauka hi nahi diya jaata hai. Even the process of selection of candidates for elections is pre-decided and manipulated. Kumar Vishwas campaigning in Amethi is proof of this,î he said. The core leadership of the AAP believed in the policy of ìuse and throwî, Binny said. ìManish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, Kumar Vishwas and Arvind Kejriwal used Anna Hazare and Kiran Bedi to further their ends. The media is used to enact their drama. How is it that the media turns up at every raid that someone conducts? They used my name as well, as someone who applied the mohalla sabha concept widely before the elections, and then cheated the people.î In response, Yadav said Binny had not used the several avenues for complaint within the party, and was spreading lies. ìThere is hope throughout the country, and a larger movement, and people, including Binny, must understand that the individual must come second to ideals,î he said. Response: Binny hasnít read party manifesto. Govt has gone back on nothing that AAP promised in writing.

539,"When supporters of Barack Obama feel compelled to write articles hotly declaring that the president isnít finished, as many have this week, you know one thing: The idea that he might be finished is very much on their minds. In one sense, the argument is entirely unnecessary. Of course Obama isnít finished. Heís the president, for Godís sake. Even if his troubles persist and deepen, he still bestrides the narrow world like a Colossus. After all, George W. Bush was ìfinishedî once Republicans lost control of the House and Senate in 2006, yet he managed to turn the Iraq War around with the controversial surge. And he was really ìfinishedî in September 2008 when the meltdown hit ó but without his support, the radical and aggressive bailout of the financial system wouldnít have happened. No president is finished until he walks out the Oval Office door. And besides, things happen that make it impossible for the president to fade into the woodwork. There could be a terrorist attack, or a natural catastrophe even more destructive than Katrina or Sandy. But note: These are events outside a presidentís control to which he must respond. His ability to act in these circumstances is really a necessity to react. The issue isnít whether Obama is finished. The issue is his pull. First, thereís his political pull ó whether he can leverage his position to move new policies. Absent a dramatic shift in his fortunes, it would seem his political pull will be weak at best going foward. This week weíve seen two absolutely horrific polls for him and one thatís only merely lousy (that one occasioned an unintentionally comic New York Times headline touting the presidentís ìrebound in the ratingsî). But in Gallupís daily tally over the past nine weeks, the presidentís approval rating has hovered consistently around 40 percent and his disapproval around 50. This means he has retained the support of Democrats, who made up 38 percent of the electorate in 2012 ó and has lost everyone else. This is clearly due to the ObamaCare rollout, and itís far from clear that ìfixing the Web siteî is going to reverse this. The key hit Obama has taken is on his trustworthiness, not on his competence. The public believes he lied to the American people about the policy implications of ObamaCare ó and once the public thinks youíre a liar, the impression is very difficult to reverse. More interesting, though, is the question of Obamaís gravitational pull: Does he remain sufficiently powerful as the fixed point in American politics that Democrats have no choice but to remain in his orbit? If so, that would be to his short-term advantage, but a blow to his partyís long-term interests. Yesterday, former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs made a stunning admission on MSNBC: ìItís very tough to see,î he said, ìhow the Democrats retain the Senate.î That was an extraordinary statement. Republicans need to pick up six Senate seats to take control, which seemed like an insuperable challenge before the ObamaCare disaster. No longer. Obamaís belly flop has solidified the likelihood that the GOP will take control of three Democratic seats ó Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. And for the same reason, incumbents are increasingly threatened in Louisiana, Arkansas, Alaska and North Carolina. Meanwhile, Republicans donít seem in much danger of losing any of their seats. What a difference two months make. In October, amidst the government shutdown, people like MSNBCís Chuck Todd were talking about a Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives. That scenario seems like science fiction now. So Obama no longer has much political pull, and his gravitational pull may be destructive to his party.

These social groups started thinking of joining active politics after the success of AAP in Delhi elections. ìMost of us had nothing to do with electoral politics but have practised extra-parliamentary politics. But for us, getting our due rights have been very difficult given the power structure of the present society. Our decision to join AAP and actively support it in the sphere of electoral politics is translation of the popular sentiments on ground,î said Shinde. Political analysts have pointed out that it would be difficult for AAP to penetrate into the ground levels given the present political equations. Sonalkar agreed that while Maharashtra might present a different social picture, AAPís message of a corruption-free society had a universal appeal. ìCorruption hits the poor and the marginal sections hardest. We need to fight it through the legislative method so that they get their due,î he said, adding that during his trips to the interior parts of the state he had noticed that the name of AAP had reached every nook and corner. Sonalkar pointed out that the work for the new party was cut out as they needed to develop a common manifesto for the country. ìIn Delhi, the party asked from the people to spell out their problems and experts mulled over it to bring out solutions. This method of drawing up the manifesto is very unique and we have to do the same across the country,î he said. Anjali Damania, AAP convenor in Maharashtra, welcomed the groupsí decision. ìThe support will help the revolution that AAP ignited in this country grow leaps and bounds,î she said.",28 social groups to join Aam Aadmi Party on January 18 | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/28-social-groups-to-join-aam-aadmi-party-on-january-18/

Definition: Chana or chickpea is one of the oldest legume or pulse known to mankind. It is popular in Europe, Northern Africa and Mediterranean countries, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is high in protein content. Description: There are two types of Chana. One is desi, which is also called Bengal Gram and is produced majorly in India, Iran, Ethopia and Mexico. The second one is Kabuli, which is also known as safed chana in India. It's mainly cultivated in Mediterranean, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Northern Africa and Chile. It is used as an edible seed and can be boiled, fried or grounded into flour for making other dishes. The prices of this commodity fluctuate frequently and are affected by the high substitutability with other pulses, crop situation and existence of fragmented markets. India is the largest producer and consumer of chana in the world, due to high consumption it is the biggest importer as well for chickpea. Its production domestically accounts for about 40% of the total production of pulses and approximately 67% of the total world production of chikpeas. In India, Chana derivatives are traded on the following exchanges that are Multi Commodity Exchange, National Multi Commodity Exchange, National Commodity Derivative Exchange and Bikaner Commodity Exchange, in units of 10 metric tonnes. In April 2004, trade in chana futures started on NCDEX platform.

Once these fledgling ventures attain a certain scale, they will be sold off to the highest bidder allowing the incubators to begin the process anew. In the past year, about half a dozen such firms, including Four Cross Media, BitChemy Ventures and Ant Farm, have launched this model in India and are running about two to three ventures each. Many in the industry say the model was first popularised by German incubation firm Rocket Internet , which owns and operates online fashion portal Jabong and restaurant delivery website Foodpanda .

548,"Related. The woman journalist who accused Tehelka founder and former editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal of sexually assaulting her in a Goa hotel,has issued a fresh statement. Here is the full text of the statement. I am heartened by the broad support I have received over the past fortnight. However,I am deeply concerned and very disturbed by insinuations that my complaint is part of a pre-election political conspiracy. I categorically refute such insinuations and put forward the following arguments: 1. The struggle for women to assert control over their lives and their bodies is most certainly a political one,but feminist politics and its concerns are wider than the narrow universe of our political parties. Thus,I call upon our political parties to resist the temptation to turn a very important discussion about gender,power and violence into a conversation about themselves. Suggestions that I am acting on someone else<U+0092>s behest are only the latest depressing indications that sections of our public discourse are unwilling to acknowledge that women are capable to making decisions about themselves for themselves. 2. In this past week,television commentators who should know better,have questioned my motivations and my actions during and after Mr. Tejpal molested me. Some have questioned the time it took for me to file my complaint,more inquisitive commentators have questioned the use of the word <U+0093>sexual molestation<U+0094> versus words like <U+0093>rape.<U+0094> Perhaps the hardest part of this unrelentingly painful experience has been my struggle with taxonomy. I don<U+0092>t know if I am ready to see myself as a <U+0093>rape victim<U+0094>,for my colleagues,friends,supporters and critics to see me thus. It is not the victim that categorizes crimes: it is the law. And in this case,the law is clear: what Mr. Tejpal did to me falls within the legal definition of rape. 3. Now that we have a new law that broadens the definition of rape,we should stand by what we fought for. We have spoken,time and again,about how rape is not about lust or sex,but about power,privilege and entitlement. Thus this new law should be applicable to everybody ñ the wealthy,the powerful,and the well connected <U+0096> and not just to faceless strangers. As seen by some of the responses to this case,instances of familial and custodial rape present doughty challenges to even the most adamantine feminists. 4. Unlike Mr. Tejpal,I am not a person of immense means. I have been raised singlehandedly by my mother<U+0092>s single income. My father<U+0092>s health has been very fragile for many years now. Unlike Mr. Tejpal,who is fighting to protect his wealth,his influence and his privilege,I am fighting to preserve nothing except for my integrity and my right to assert that my body is my own and not the plaything of my employer. By filing my complaint,I have lost not just a job that I loved,but much-needed financial security and the independence of my salary. I have also opened myself to personal and slanderous attack. This will not be an easy battle. 5. In my life,and my writings,I have always urged women to speak out and break the collusive silence that surrounds sexual crime. This crisis has only confirmed the myriad difficulties faced by survivors. First,our utterances are questioned,then our motivations,and finally our strength is turned against us: a politician will issue a statement claiming that speaking out against sexual violence will hurt our professional prospects; an application filed in the Delhi High Court will question why the victim remained <U+0093>normal<U+0094>. Had I chosen silence in this instance,I would not have been able to face either myself or the feminist movement that is forged and renewed afresh by generations of strong women.6. Finally,an array of men of privilege have expressed sorrow that Tehelka,the institution,has suffered in this crisis. I remind them that this crisis was caused by the abusive violence of the magazine<U+0092>s Editor-in-Chief,and not by an employee who chose to speak out.","Tarun Tejpal is fighting to protect his wealth,I am fighting to preserve my integrity,says woman journalist | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/crime/tarun-tejpal-is-fighting-to-protect-his-wealth-i-am-fighting-to-preserve-my-integrity-says-woman-journalist/

He further said,îOne-and-half hours later,around 10:30 PM,Tejpal is seen near the same elevator on the ground floor pulling the woman insideî. The officer said the lift was seen opening on the second floor almost after two minutes. ìThe woman is seen coming out of the elevator adjusting her clothes and running down the steps as Tejpal follows her,î the officer added.

Though Tejpal initially apologised for the incident to the woman,he later said it was a ìdrunken banterî and ìconsensual actî. The journalist has dismissed Tejpalís claims.

552,"As we emerge from our holiday hibernation and discover Ike Davis is still a Mets employee, letís frame the question this way: What scenario would prompt another club to switch gears and pay a high price for the high-ceiling, high-struggling first baseman? What would the Mets need to happen to reach their current asking price? A spring-training injury? A slow start by a fledgling first baseman elsewhere? A fast Grapefruit League start by Davis? An unforeseen swarm of locusts in Arizona? We come today not to rip, as more than six weeks remain before the Mets welcome their position players to Port St. Lucie. Consider this instead a piece of friendly advice for the most improved baseball team in New York: If they prolong the ìWhereís Ike Going?î saga into spring training, the Mets are crazy. The rewards donít validate the risks. Sandy Alderson said of his first-base surplus, on Dec. 17, ìIf we donít get what we want in return, weíll have to think of other options, which would be to wait or to even go into spring training with more than one [first baseman].î Hereís what Brewers general manager Doug Melvin, whose club could use a first baseman, told MLB.com on Monday: ìFirst base, Iíve had ongoing discussions with [Mets general manager] Sandy Alderson, but we havenít gotten to anything where weíre comfortable with the deal from our side, and heís not been comfortable with the deal from his side.î The Mets want pitcher Tyler Thornburg, regarded by the Brewers as a possible back-end-rotation starter, from Milwaukee. Another pitcher with that sort of potential, Baltimoreís Eduardo Rodriguez, caught the Metsí attention in trade discussions. The Pirates still have a void at first base, and they, too, havenít been able to match up with Alderson and his crew on Davis. Trading established commodities has been Aldersonís greatest attribute since he took over the Mets three-plus years ago; his deals of Carlos Beltran (to San Francisco, in 2011) and R.A. Dickey (to Toronto, in 2012) have stocked the roster with high-ceiling players. Maybe Aldersonís patience on Davis will pay off similarly, if not as spectacularly. Or maybe the Ike Sweepstakes should be viewed as one talent evaluator from a National League club put it Monday, on the condition of anonymity: ìItís like running a Mercedes dealership and saying, ëWeíre going to charge you $55,000 for this car, but itís used and banged up, and you have to figure out how to fix it. Not us, you.íî To say Davis is a talented player coming off a terrible season represents oversimplification. His mechanics scare the devil out of scouts just as much as his raw power worries opposing managers and pitching coaches. And he plays the position that is most easily replaced in a National League lineup. Yup, he easily could haunt the Mets by going elsewhere and launching 30-plus homers again, especially in a hitter-friendly ballpark like the Brewersí Miller Park. Yet his best overall offensive campaign came in 2010, his rookie year, so a) thatís four years ago already, and b) he tallied a relatively modest 2.0 oWAR (offensive wins above replacement) that season, as per Baseball-Reference.com, and Lucas Duda hit the same peak in 2011. Odds donít favor a rise to superstar level. To bring Davis and Duda into camp together, a concept the Mets have discussed internally, is to tilt the media focus away from exciting newcomers (Bartolo Colon and Curtis Granderson) and rising hopes (Zack Wheeler and Noah Syndergaard) and toward the daily first-base derby. It would place excess scrutiny on spring-training plate appearances by two guys who have struggled with their confidence previously. And what happens if Davis actually does hit well in Grapefruit League action? Do the Mets get tempted to place their emotional chips on their former first-round draft pick once again? No, itís time for all parties to move on. Davis, who has handled his rises and falls with dignity, deserves a fresh start. The Mets owe themselves a clean break. To get that, theyíll likely have to blink on their asking price. Where do you expect Ike to end up? keep dreaming that if we trade ike he is going to be another chris davis try more like mike jacobs sandy is not going to pay this guy 3.5 million to hit 200 and strike out 90% of the time ike wont even make the team he will be sent down to the minors duda can hit lefty pitching ike cant ike is no mattingly at 1st base defensively duda is decent at 1st give the guy a shot to be a everyday player he might surprise alot of us the guy is a moose and has great power i can see him a 25 85 guy with a 250avg and if he fails you can get a free agent 1B† in 2015 but what if he dosent fail alderson will be a genius and the duda haters will look pretty stupid. Ike is never going to be a good mlb player with that putrid swing. Give it up already people. Hes been exposed and has been given every possible chance to right the ship and he failed. We cant go into another season just hoping that he'll magically become the player you all want him to be. Ike is a scrub and unfortunately so many fans are so emotionally invested with this guy they cant let it go. There are more Kevin Maas' than Chris Davis' Mets don't have to accept less. They have to get rid of Duda not Ike. Ike ceiling is much higher. Duda is not a 1st basemen. Didn't the Mets have enough of playing players out of position. Ike can raise his value to where, if you still want to trade him, you can get more. Ike already proved he can hit 30+ HRs. If he starts off hot and shows promise of another 30+HR season, you can get more. Duda on the other hand you might have to accept less to get rid of. Even if he get hot, he wouldn't be worth much. no track record of hitting 30 hrs and no position he plays well. How come nobody ever addresses Duda's inability to play first base or any other defensive position. He is a liability in the field and needs to stay off it. He is only suited for the AL as a DH. Even that is questionable. The Mets can't live with Duda at first base. If they are inclined to not use Ike there, then they should switch Murphy to first and let Eric Young play second. Young's speed and ability to steal bases is much needed in a line up that is lacking this attribute. This is not Luis Castillo or Oliver Perez or even Jason Bay. †Ike Davis has been mostly a disaster but doesn't make much money in the scheme of things, and has shown promise in the second half of both 2012 and 2013. So the exact opposite of his point his true: the potential reward - i.e. a potentially huge offensive boost in the 25+ HR, 85+ RBI range plus a heartwarming turnaround story - vastly outweighs the potential risk, which is that he struggles yet again and the team sends him down (does he have options left?) or even releases him in May. †No one else in New York agrees with this. †It just undermines Davidoff's credibility as an astute judge of the situation. Alderson has to do what's best for the Mets. Who gives a fat rat's ^ss what the media says about anything. Personally I don't see it with Davis. He had an ok rookie year a great Month in 2011 and after that he's been mostly a disaster. If all they're getting offered is a mop-up guy then hold onto him a little longer. The reward would outweigh the risk. What a stupid article.† The writer is saying that because HE is impatient about trading Davis, the Mets should trade him for less just to get rid of him.† No wonder why the title ""GM"" doesn't appear in front of Davidoff's name. baltimore, but instead of getting pitching in return, open up the discussion for jj hardy - sandy would have to say good-bye to either neise or gee along with ike davis and tejada. then, put those mets minor league pitchers to work in the bigs and show us what they've got. hardy is in his prime now, (but i think he's a free agent after next season). not a perfect deal but it would solve a couple of issues... Absurd.† An Ike Davis or Lucas Duda controversy is like a controversy over which side of the pillow to sleep on.† It's mundane and won't cause any meaningful distractions.† And that doesn't even take into account that reporters and fans overemphasize how supposed controversies affect play.† If you think that having Ike and Duda on the team will create friction that will affect the Mets won loss record, hand in your pass to the NY Post offices on your way out tonight. Ike is relatively cheap -- 3 to 4 mill.† Duda -- who is older and as good as he's going to get -- is relatively cheap too.† And unless the Mets are going to do what they should've done, which is sign a better first baseman, they need a first baseman.† So they they'll have a little competition for the job.† That's good.† If they don't get anything useful for Ike, it makes no sense to dump him.† That is, unless they have a useful replacement.† Which they don't. Given that the Mets aren't going to get themselves a better first baseman, they're doing the right thing.† Get a serviceable prospect in a trade, or let him slug it out with Duda (and Satin). Thank god the new Mets brass don't react to reactionary articles that find drama where this is none. So, because the Ken Davidoffs of the world and all the other sports†media twerps have nothing else to write about, it's time to get antsy about the Mets and harass the crap out of them to do something - ANYTHING - to create a headline for tomorrow's paper? And if/when the Mets DO trade Davis, does anyone have any clue who will be the first sports columnists to be ""surprised"" and†rip Alderson and the Mets for ""giving"" Davis away in some boneheaded/unnecessary deal? Does everyone remember last month when†every†know-nothing sports media jerk jumped all over the Mets for not making any noise at the Winter Meetings - only to have to eat their own words 12 hours later when the Mets became ""the surprise team"" of those meetings? I'm comfortable knowing Alderson is going to make the best deal possible at a time and place that HE chooses - not the media.† And if he doesn't trade Davis, it means†there weren't any GOOD deals to be made for him - period.†††Davidoff, Sherman, and all the other NYP writers are the†very LAST people Alderson talks with.† Good. @ frankinflorida - I wouldn't trade Niese of Gee for Hardy straight up. Baltimore would have to sweeten the pot from their end in my opinion. Gee is a dependable back of the rotation arm and Niese is a solid middle of the rotation guy, a lefty with quality stuff. @ Brewski1957 - I agree. Who cares what ANYONE thinks. Thank god we have a guy with patience and maturity calling the shots. I always felt like Minaya read the headlines FAR too much. He always seemed to be reacting to what the media was saying. Alderson hasn't been perfect but I like that he couldn't care less what anyone thinks. He's not that interested in talking to the press and he couldn't care less what they think. If he can get a serviceable player for Davis then more power to him. If not then he's not losing anything. It's not like you have a known quantity in Duda to play the position. He's just as much a wild card.

Their relationship has soured as Rodriguez and his advocates continually lodged public accusations against Yankees president Randy Levine. Furthermore, Rodriguez is suing Yankees team physician Christopher Ahmad. Nevertheless, when asked how much he would consider the extensive bad blood that has developed between the Yankees and Rodriguez, Steinbrenner said, ìThose of you that know me, Iím pretty objective in my thinking. This is business. Iím just focusing on the team, a player. Is the player an asset to the club or not? Thatís about as far as I look. I donít get personal.î Asked whether he regarded Rodriguez as an asset, Steinbrenner said, ìWhen Alex Rodriguez is healthy and himself, I think most objective baseball people would say he could be an asset to a club.î Rodriguez has been adamant that he will report to spring training, a notion that appeals to neither the Yankees nor MLB. Baseballís collective bargaining agreement is hazy as to whether a player suspended for an entire season is entitled to come to camp. ìWe havenít even talked about it,î Steinbrenner said. ìCross that bridge when we come to it kind of thing. Weíre going to reach out to MLB, get their advice obviously, but havenít even addressed it.î The Yankees hope to address shortly a non-Rodriguez matter, Steinbrenner indicated. With former manager Joe Torre set to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in July, the Yankees appear poised to use that milestone to retire the numbers of not just Torre, but some of those who played under him. ìWeíre going to figure out just who. He may not be the only one,î Steinbrenner said. ìWe havenít gotten into it yet.î Torreís 6, Paul OíNeillís 21, Bernie Williamsí 51 and Jorge Posadaís 20 have all largely been out of circulation since each stopped wearing a Yankees uniform. The Yankees retired Mariano Riveraís 42 last year upon his retirement, and Andy Pettitteís 46 also surely will be considered for Monument Park immortality. ìNobody has talked to me about it,î said Torre, also present at the meetings in his role of MLBís executive vice president of baseball operations. ìIíve got people calling me, congratulating me about it. Ö But if it does happen, obviously, itíll be a hell of a thrill.î Steinbrenner also said of the teamís unsolidified closer situation, ìWeíre going to rely on [David] Robertson. Iím sure heíll do a good job for us.î The Yankees havenít officially anointed Robertson as Riveraís successor and experienced closers Grant Balfour and Fernando Rodney remain available on the free-agent market. Pressed whether he thought Robertson would be the teamís closer, Steinbrenner said, ìI think youíll have to ask [Joe] Girardi that, but thatís my understanding. Heís the number one candidate. Rightfully so.î What I noticed is the last few articles written by Ken Davidoff contained controversial opinions given by himself. There were no options for the readers to post any comments or give their own opinions. Another words this very comments section that I'm posting on right now did not exist after Mr. Davidoff's ridiculous prints. Now that he puts up this posted article that primarily covers Mr. Steinbrenner's excerpts Mr. Davidoff opens the hall for the readers to post their comments. Is Mr. Davidoff playing a safe zone? Electing to dodge the reader's feedback whenever he comes out with crazy and controversial articles he tends to write? Hank is simply leaving all of his options open and not verbally painting himself into a corner. Why give A-Rod any ammo for his ""the world is out to get me"" lawsuits? If they'll swallow what remains of his contract in 2015, they can do it just as easily without announcing it a year ahead of time. And, who knows? Maybe they can trade him. Maybe he actually will play for them in 2015. Since they're paying him anyway, it makes sense to try to get something instead of just giving him a $60,000,000+ ""get lost"" gift. So, the Yankees are planning on paying him $61 million for nothing? There is NO WAY he will take a buyout. I think he has made that pretty clear. He knows no one else will sign him, so why would he take less than the full amount? Included in the law suit mix is the MLBPA - which is certain to alienate a number of teammates and players around the league. Thus, Hal views a guy that is certain to be a 'cancer' in the locker room an 'asset'? IF the Yanks are really serious about wanting to move forward and focus on winning they should make the release of Rodriguez as priority 1. $60 m is a lot of money and this would be an expensive lesson in why 10 year extensions are a bad idea for 32 year old players. But his release would be welcomed by the fan base and would make all of us feel cleaner. @ Pieman I don't think he'll play another game for the Yankees, but they are just waiting for all the legal dust to settle before they move forward. I don't know if they'll try and void his contract in court or just simply release him, they might not even know themselves.",A-Rod playing for the Yankees in 2015?

554,"As a young banker, once tipped for the top job at ICICI Bank , Nachiket Mor was known as a sharp professional who demonstrated a capacity for ideas as well as an impatience with slow outcomes. In 2007, even his peers at the bank advanced to corner offices, he retreated to the temple town of Thanjavur to lead ICICI Foundation , which worked in the field of rural development. So, when Raghuram Rajan, soon after taking over the central bank, plucked out Mor and brought him back to the mainstream to lead a panel on financial inclusion, it was a statement of intent from the governor as a committee on the issue already existed. The Mor Committee's report, presented last week, is ambitious and aggressive. And therefore, some say, impractical. ""What India could not achieve in 60 years, the Mor committee wants to achieve in two years,"" says a rural finance practitioner, not wanting to be named. The report is based on four building blocks, each of which has a key question facing it. POINT OF ENTRY: Should Aadhaar form the underpinning of bank accounts and transactions? The Mor panel pins much hope and responsibility on Aadhaar, the unique identity number currently being issued by the government. The panel's big proposal of every Indian resident above the age of 18 years having a full-fledged bank account that can be accessed from anywhere by January 1, 2016, is predicated on Aadhaar. It wants the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which issues Aadhaar, to automatically open a bank account at the time of issuing an Aadhaar number to an individual. According to Mor, since UIDAI has verified all the personal details of an individual, a bank need not replicate that process. Mor reckons UIDAI, which is adding 30 million numbers a month, will finish issuing Aadhaar numbers to all Indians by December 2015, and hence the January 1, 2016 deadline. According to UPA's progress report for the last 10 years, released earlier this month, UIDAI has issued 510 million Aadhaar numbers, but only 40 million have been seeded into bank accounts. The panel further recommends using Aadhaarówhich has a record of an individual's fingerprintsóas the ""universal basis for authentication"". The panel's vision of financial inclusion sees every Indian with a bank account and an infrastructure where access is a 15-minute walk away. Since physical branches and ATMs are expensive, roving agents, or banking correspondents (BCs), are key to that infrastructure. These BCs will move around with handheld consoles (like credit card readers), equipped with a biometric reader to verify a person's identity, and enable deposits and withdrawals. The panel says that till biometrics become universal, alternatives like PIN numbers and one-time passwords (OTPs) can also be used for authentication. ""OTPs and PINs are unprotected systems, which make the last mile even more vulnerable,"" counters Usha Ramanathan, a Delhi-based legal researcher. Aadhaar-enabled fingerprint authentication is being used to make payments (like NREGA), but issues have cropped up. Machines struggle to identify the biometrics of labourers and the old. ""Fingerprints wear out, become rough and unidentifiable, fade; iris template ages, even between 1.5-3 years, as research has shown,"" says Ramanathan. ""Since no one is liable if it goes wrong, there is this glib enrolment and adoption of its use."" The other issue pertains to the legality of making Aadhaar mandatory, as envisaged by the Mor panel. An interim SC order, in a case challenging the UID project, has forbidden governments from making Aadhaar mandatory to access a government service. To make it mandatory, the government will have to obtain a buy in of the Parliament and have the UIDAI Bill passed, which could take time.",Exploring feasibility of Nachiket Mor panel's road map for financial inclusion by 2016 - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/exploring-feasibility-of-nachiket-mor-panels-road-map-for-financial-inclusion-by-2016/articleshow/28861577.cms

556,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat High Court today granted 15 days time to a lawyer, who had challenged legality of the Inquiry Commission set up by the State Government in snooping of a woman, to produce notification issued by the Centre which had set up a separate judicial panel to look into the episode. The Narendra Modi Government has set up the Commission under retired High Court Judge Sugnya Bhatt to probe into what has come to be known as "" snoopgate "". The petitioner, lawyer Girish Das, in his PIL sought 15 days time to produce the notification issued by the Centre to set up the Commission to probe into illegal surveillance of the woman, an architect, by Gujarat Police in 2009. A division bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhatacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala granted him till January 30 to produce the notification. Meanwhile, another advocate Ratna Vora today filed an application seeking to join as part-respondent in the PIL, which was accepted by the Bench. Das today argued that when the Centre had formed a Commission to enquire into ""snoopgate"", the panel set up by the State had no authority and hence, it should be disbanded. However, the court held both the State and the Centre have authority to set up probe panels into the incident under the Commission of Inquiry Act. In his PIL, the petitioner had also sought a CBI inquiry into alleged illegal phone-tapping of 93,000 persons carried out by the State Government in the last six months.

They had released taped conversations between Shah and suspended IPS officer G L Singhal to support their claim. The State Government on November 25 formed two-member Commission, comprising Justice Bhatt and former IAS officer K C Kapoor, to probe the snooping scandal.

558,"India wonít sit quietly if Pakistan breaks rules: Army†Chief. He rejected the perception that Indian military has not retaliated against the beheading of its soldiers by Pakistani troops last year. (Reuters) Summary. In a warning to Pakistan, Army Chief Gen Bikram Singh Monday said India will respond in equal measure if Pakistan breaks any rules as he revealed that 10 Pakistani soldiers had been killed in a recent military action. Related. Army Chief General Bikram Singh on Monday cautioned that a ìwait and watchî approach should be followed for the withdrawal of the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) from Jammu and Kashmir as there are concerns about a spillover effect from Afghanistan due to the drawdown this year, even as he asserted that a strong reply has been given to last yearís cross-border raids by Pakistan, referring to reports that 10 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in India action across the Line of Control (LoC). Singh, who sought to reject notions that Indiaís response to the Pakistani raids last year that left seven soldiers dead (one of them beheaded) were soft, referred to reports from Pakistan last month that said 10 soldiers, including an officer had been killed in firing by India and 12-13 had been injured. On being asked what retaliatory action has been taken, the Army Chief said that soldiers ìhave reacted well as requiredî and that there is an endeavour ìnot to escalate the situation into operational or strategic arenaî. He also said that India has been trying to follow the rules of engagement on the border, but if they are broken by Pakistan, retaliation has to happen. ìIt depends, if rules are followed by our neighbours, we follow the rules. If rules are broken, then obviously we cannot stick to the rules. Even we are going to break the rules,î said Singh said ahead of the Army Day celebrations on Wednesday. Singh also made a case for no dilution yet of the AFSPA and the Disturbed Areas Act in Jammu and Kashmir, arguing that the drawdown of international security forces from Afghanistan can have a spillover effect. ìWe need to look at developments in Afghanistan in 2014 before we can look at perhaps tampering with or diluting the Disturbed Areas (Act)Ö the situation prevailing in the Valley, I think we should wait for a while to see whether the situation remains the same, worsens or improves. Based on that we should take action,î said Singh. ìThere are certain inputs alluding to this already. And therefore, we need to be on guard,î he added. On incidents on the China border, Singh said that while there has been a certain spike in incursions in some sectors along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there has been an equal response from the Indian side as well. Referring to the Depsang incident last year and reports of frequent transgressions, he said, ìLet me be frank, somehow two incidents got hyped up last year. Even Indian soldiers are patrolling up to our perceived LAC.î Giving details on the creation of the new Mountain Strike Corps, Singh said the headquarters was formally raised on January 1 and the process of creating 22 major and minor units was started on December 1.

Survivors of the ìMiracle on the Hudsonî marked Wednesdayís fifth anniversary of the amazing splash landing by toasting their good fortune on one of the ferries used in the river rescue that saved everyone aboard the ill-fated flight. About a half-dozen passengers joined hero pilot Chesley ìSullyî Sullenberger III and co-pilot Jeff Skiles for a brief cruise on the George Washington, one of seven New York Waterway ferries that responded to the emergency. The group, which also included ferry workers and Sullenbergerís wife and family, hoisted glasses of champagne near the spot where US Airways Flight 1549 landed on Jan. 15, 2009.

561,"When I was 15 years old, I dropped out of school to join my father's electronic trading business in Mumbai. My move was not prompted by dire financial circumstances, but by sheer fascination. I was keenly interested in the family business , and this is why my parents did not force me to complete my education. In 1992, I started by helping my father with accounts, for which he paid me Rs4,000-5,000 per month. Five years on, I helped him get into other verticals, such as garments, musical instruments and imported mobile phone accessories . For the latter, we visited manufacturers in Malaysia and China, and this helped me when I launched my own company in January 2002. I began with a seed capital of Rs10 lakh, which came from my savings. The first step was to have my proprietorship firm registered in the name of Max Mobiles and Phone Accessories; it was only in 2004 that we set up Maxx Mobile as a company. Initially, I would stamp my brand name on imported mobile phone batteries and sell them to dealers in Mumbai. The response was very good because my prices were lower than those of other brands in the market. Besides, I offered a warranty on batteries, which resulted in some losses because the overseas manufacturers would not give us a replacement for damaged goods. Still, it was a small price to pay for establishing the brand, and before the year ended, the firm had registered a sales figure of Rs15 lakh. At the beginning of 2004, I figured that I should set up my own manufacturing unit for mobile phone batteries. I could easily afford the move since I had saved nearly Rs40 lakh from the company profit. To begin with, I leased a 3,500 sq ft space at Malad, Mumbai, and stocked it with a plastic moulding machine and a welding machine, both imported from Korea. I also employed 25-30 people for the new venture, and by February 2004, our manufacturing unit was up and running. Initially, we suffered frequent breakdowns due to overloading since the workers lacked experience in handling them. To overcome the problem, we hired a technician from a big company by paying him twice the salary he was getting. This proved to be a good investment, and by April 2004, we were manufacturing 5,000 batteries a day. The next obvious move was to expand the operations. In 2006, we purchased 6,000 sq ft of land at Haridwar for Rs20 lakh, the funds coming from internal accruals. It cost us another Rs2.5 crore to set up the factory and purchase machines, for which we took bank loans. Once the Haridwar factory was functional, our output shot up to nearly 1 lakh pieces a day. The turnover for 2006-7 was Rs2 crore, which increased to Rs5 crore the following year, after we forayed into the headset business as well. The next crucial year was 2008, when we started importing mobile phones and selling them under the brand name Maxx Mobile. Between August 2008 and December 2009, we launched almost 33 feature phone models. We also spent nearly Rs10 crore on setting up 23 dedicated outlets for our products in different cities across the country. Meanwhile, we became associated with the IPL matches and spent Rs12 crore on advertising. To fund these aggressive plans, we had to look beyond our own reserves, so we resorted to an additional funding of $20 million (approximately Rs100 crore at the time) from Star Holdings (Asia), a Singaporebased company. Amazingly, we recorded a turnover of Rs590 crore in the first five months of taking the initiative. In 2009, we signed on M S Dhoni as our brand ambassador and the advertising campaign during the T20 World Cup helped us get eyeballs. Within three months, we reeled in 250 distributors and 35,000 retailers. By the end of 2011-12, the turnover touched Rs1,260 crore. However, the rupee fluctuation took a major toll on the business, with the turnover dropping to nearly Rs435 crore in 2012-13. Another learning from last year was to monitor the goods we stocked since we were left with a large number of an obsolete range of phones, which contributed to big losses. We have learnt from our mistakes and have streamlined the operations. Today, we cater to all consumer segments, boasting 84 mobile phone models spanning dual-SIM budget phones, touchscreen phones, besides the mid-range and high-end Android smartphones and tablets. Our 550-employee company is eyeing a turnover of Rs600 crore in the current financial year. For any Indian brand to succeed, it's important to take care of the after-sales service. At present, we have around 1,000 service centres, which are set to double by the end of April 2014. Next on the cards is the manufacturing of Android mobile phones, though the idea is on hold due to the tax structure in the country , which makes it financially unviable for us. In the meantime, we are looking forward to a turnover of Rs1,500 crore by end-2017.",Ajjay Agarwal's Maxx Mobile is a multi-crore brand in a decade - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/emerging-businesses/entrepreneurship/ajjay-agarwals-maxx-mobile-is-a-multi-crore-brand-in-a-decade/articleshow/28672436.cms
562,"When he was 18 years old, Akshay Agarwal's hostel room printing venture ran the neighbourhood printer out of business. ""While pursuing MBA from Jain College in Bangalore, I registered for an apprenticeship programme . Under it, each student had to multiply an allocated budget of Rs1,000,"" says Agarwal, adding, ""I stumbled upon my opportunity right outside college."" He explains that the only shop near his college offering printing services charged Rs8 per page. ""I started researching on reducing the cost and discovered that the actual cost of printing a page was less than Rs1.50,"" he says. So Agarwal leased a printer and started offering a cut-throat rate of Rs5 per page. ""Within three months, I not only managed to make Rs80,000, but also bagged the entrepreneur award in my programme,"" he says. Given that he hails from a family of entrepreneurs , his next step raised no brows: he used nearly Rs25,000 of his profit to start a business. ""My father was keen that I join the family's manufacturing rolling mills, but I decided to foray into website designing instead,"" says Agarwal, 26. He tied up with a software vendor to reserve space on his server, for which he paid nearly Rs6,000. He also kept aside Rs1,000 a month to advertise on business networking sites. ""I saved the rest of the seed capital for contingencies,"" he says. Finally, in February 2006, even before he graduated, he launched his venture, Akshay Solutions. ""My first job was to develop a website for the BBM department at my college. More orders followed and, in the first year of operations, my revenue was almost Rs3 lakh,"" he says. Lacking time, Agarwal outsourced jobs to smaller software developers, checked the work quality, and billed clients under his own brand name. A year later, he renamed the company, Tech Active Solutions, in an attempt to widen the reach. Then, in 2008, Agarwal enrolled for a oneyear course in management and organisational change from Lancaster University, UK, and employed a friend in Bangalore to handle his business in his absence. ""During this period, I discovered that one could charge Rs2-3 lakh for creating a website in the UK, compared with just Rs15,000-20,000 in India,"" he says. So, after completing the course in 2009, Agarwal set up an office in Lancaster and employed four people. ""Due to the recession , we got a 200 sq ft place on lease for one-fifth the actual cost,"" he says. He then set up a new company, AS Global, to manage the UK operations. Around the same time, he scaled up the operations in India and moved into a 2,500 sq ft office staffed by 20 people. His turnover for 2009-10 was Rs30 lakh. The next step was to get into product development. ""We began developing mobile applications as well. In 2010, Subrata Ghosh, the ad guru, liked our work and helped us bag contracts for companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra, the Future Group and Haldiram's,"" says Agarwal.

564,"Devyani Khobragade is back and bidding fair to being a launch-pad for a family political career under the tutelage of an ambitious parent. India-US relations lie in tatters with little expectation of a revival any time soon. The Indian outburst against the diplomat's treatment threw the US. There was nothing when former presidents or sitting ambassadors were patted down by US security officials at airports. It is well known, goes the US understanding, that Indians treat their servants like slaves, without human rights or fair wages and for inhumanly long hours. Indians are bleeding hearts when it comes to a rich female diplomat but ignore the plight of the underpaid, overworked servant. American commentary has burned through newsprint and cyberspace about how this rising country juxtaposes a bright and growing middle class with grinding poverty. Oh, and let's not forget that old Draupadi vastraharan story, which is apparently why otherwise sane Indians went ballistic. All arguments intended to highlight one thing - Indians really have no business protesting against the treatment of a diplomat. Yes, there are many Indians who ill-treat their domestic servants, just like there are innumerable instances of Americans or Europeans or others mistreating their servants and workers. None of this has any bearing on the present case because Sangeeta Richard was not treated improperly or paid poorly. It is about an overweening interest in getting the Richard family over to the US by some 'sympathetic' US officials. The ensuing mess flows from this one fact. Whatever MEA's private opinion about Devyani, the Indian system had to stand up for her particularly when there was no wrongdoing. For the same reason that the US stood up for Raymond Davies in Pakistan, India had to protect its officials for its own credibility. But having emerged on the other side of the looking glass, the Indian system needs to do some serious housekeeping. First, junior diplomats do not need to take domestic helps to the US or European countries. The government can pick up the tab for cleaning services, child care, entertainment etc, but diplomats must learn to live without servants abroad. Pay a maid in the US at the prevailing rate - it's cheaper than taking a servant along. For this, the external affairs ministry (MEA) should change its service rules. The other option is to bring domestic servants under government employment , putting them in a different visa category. The finance ministry opposes that for good reason. Second, it is very important to work out a set of rules for diplomats, their immunity status or mission security, with the US. The informal 'wink-nod' arrangements with the State Department just do not work. The US is a legalistic society, so put it all down on paper with built-in reciprocal arrangements . The US has been reluctant to have this conversation all these years - the Khobragade affair is a good place to start. The US has already used the issue to unveil a strategic plan to register domestic workers of foreign diplomats in the US for trafficking and other abuses. India should use this to put its own house in order. The State Department and the US embassy in New Delhi dropped the ball on Khobragade - but so did the MEA. This issue should have been nipped in the bud months ago, particularly when the US Trafficking Act of 2000 makes it easier for Indians of all stripes to be eligible for this status, whether warranted or otherwise. The Indian embassy in Washington and South Block have some answering to do here. New Delhi needs to set up systems that can manage the relationship better, anticipate and solve problems in advance. A closer look should be given to how many supposedly rare 'trafficking' visas are issued to Indians. The numbers are shocking: more Indian families get trafficking visas to join their 'trafficked' spouses and parents than any other country. Nobody denies there are huge trafficking issues in India. The home ministry just needs to understand this better by interviewing those going to the US on trafficking visas. India and the US conducted a bilateral conversation on trafficking that, like many other bilateral initiatives, has fallen silent. Neither Barack Obama nor Manmohan Singh is particularly interested in the bilateral relationship. Nor is Susan Rice or Shivshankar Menon. But we cannot let a vital relationship like this fall prey to competing negligence. As envoy to China, S Jaishankar led the Indian team to put India-China ties on an even keel, and in a previous avatar was India's lead negotiator for the nuclear deal, acknowledged as the only high point in the UPA decade. A top-notch negotiator, Jaishankar has a more challenging job as he steps over the broken china in Washington. His primary task will be to put back on course a strategic partnership gone awry. The first ice-breaker happened on Tuesday with a lunch meeting with William Burns. During the Khobragade crisis , Jaishankar and foreign secretary Sujatha Singh teamed up effectively, which bodes well for the future because it will be Sujatha's job to rally South Block to ensure MEA goes beyond hurt egos and 'diploutrage' . There is a time for anger. But now is the time to move on India's interests. Of those there are many.","Clean Khobragade mess, MEA should now put its own house in order - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/comments-analysis/clean-khobragade-mess-mea-should-now-put-its-own-house-in-order/articleshow/28871063.cms

A dalit percussion artiste was banned from performing within the precincts of the famous Sree Krishna Temple at Guruvayoor in Kerala, bringing back the spectre of caste-based discrimination. The temple in Thrissur district is open to all Hindus. A taxi driver by profession, Kalloor Babu, 40, has been playing ëelathalamí ó one of the five instruments in panchavadyam ó for the past 15 years. He used to go for panchavadyam performance outside the temple along with artistes belonging to other Hindu segments, particularly the Marar sect. Marar, an upper class Nair segment, is a community traditionally performing percussion instruments in temples. On January 5, Babu got a chance to make his debut performance within the temple. Thinking that there was nothing wrong in a Dalit performing elathalam, a metallic musical instrument which looks like a miniature of cymbals, Babu took part in the panchavadyam ensemble within the temple. According to Babu, ìCertain temple staff members belonging to upper class Hindu spotted the Dalit performing at the temple. They complained to the temple authorities, who asked me through an agent not to repeat the performance in the temple. I have been banned on caste basis.î Babu said the upper class members in the panchavadyam team had persuaded him to join them in the temple performance. Non-Marar upper class Hindus are performing kombu, a wind instrument, as part of panchavadyam. ìIf a Dalit is offering a lamp to the temple, the priests have no qualms. If a Dalit is offering money, the temple does not throw it away on the ground that the amount was from backward caste. If they can accept Dalit money, why not allow a Dalit to perform elathalam,î asks Babu. Deputy administrator Vijayan Nambair said certain temple staff complained against Babu performing within temple precincts. ìThere is an age-old tradition in the temple that only Marar community members should beat drum instruments. Although several Hindu organisations and writers have protested against the decision on the Dalit performer, we have to look at the tradition. Temple thantri would have to decide on whether the custom has to be changed or not,î said Nambair. Guruvayoor Temple Affairs Board chairman and Congress leader T V Chandramohan said the board has received a complaint from an organisation against the decision on the Dalit artist. ìWe will look into the issue in the January 21 meeting,î he said.",Dalit musician banned at Guruvayoor temple | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/dalit-musician-banned-at-guruvayoor-temple/
566,"Definition of 'Comparative Advantage' The benefit of an economy to be able to produce a commodity at a lesser opportunity cost than other entities is referred to as comparative advantage. Definition: The benefit or advantage of an economy to be able to produce a commodity at a lesser opportunity cost than other entities is referred to as comparative advantage in international trade theory. Description: The principle of comparative advantage is fundamental to determination of the pattern of trade among nations. David Ricardo was the economist who coined this term. Opportunity cost, stated briefly, is the benefit foregone for undertaking an activity. So, if a country has a lesser value for its resources in the alternative use, it can most efficiently employ resources in this activity. This is what comparative advantage means. Example: Two goods are produced, say wine and wheat, using only one input, i.e. labour. Suppose Nation A requires 10 and 5 units of labour to produce one unit of wine and wheat, respectively, whereas, Nation B requires 10 units of labour each. In such a scenario, while Nation B will have to forego 1 unit of wine for production of an additional unit of wheat, Nation A will have to forego only half a unit of wine for the same. Since Nation A can produce wheat at a lower opportunity cost, therefore its best for it to produce and export it, i.e. specialize in the production of wheat. On the other hand, Nation B has to forego only one unit of wheat for production of additional unit of wine as opposed to a loss of two units of wheat in case of Nation A. Therefore, Nation B must specialize in the production of wine.",Comparative Advantage Definition | Comparative Advantage Meaning - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/comparative-advantage

As the two silhouettes collapse into each other, Naseeruddin Shah , playing the crook-poet Khalujaan, says with a resigned smile, "" Lihaaf maang lein (Shall we ask for a quilt)?"" In a movie of splendid allusions, it is not a throwaway line. Lihaaf - the famous short story by Ismat Chughtai - celebrated lesbian love that heaves, in secret, under a quilt. Here, Khalujaan asks for a lihaaf for Begum Para and Muniya, played by Madhuri Dixit and Huma Qureshi, in Abhishek Chaubey's film Dedh Ishqiya. Bollywood's hunky heroes have alluded to gay sex with all the innuendos at their command: often they were heterosexual characters playing mock-homosexuals in New York ( Kal Ho Naa Ho) or Miami ( Dostana). Gay characters have sporadically appeared in a handful of movies between Rafoo Chakkar and My Brother Nikhil. But when did a mainstream Bollywood heroine play gay in a mainstream Hindi movie - before and since Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das kissed in Fire?

She was the dhak-dhak girl, the ek, do, teen enchantress, the dream woman of Rahul and Prem. Now she conspires to flee with a woman, Muniya. There are a few more wrinkles on Dixit's face, but these only show how far Hindi cinema has travelled. And, yet, some things have remained the same, 72 years after Lihaaf. Chughtai has written about the Lihaaf trial, a case that crumbled because the judge could not spot one obscene word in her story. She writes, ""The proceedings had lost some of their verve, the witnesses who were called in to prove that Lihaaf was obscene were beginning to lose their nerve in the face of our lawyer's cross-examination.

The two contested the polls yesterday, though in most places the two parties managed to reach a consensus in fielding common candidates.

570,"Related. Throngs of whistle-blowing protesters were on the march again in the Thai capital Thursday, surrounding several government offices they had not previously interfered with to keep up pressure on the prime minister to resign and call off next monthís election. The marches appeared to be a way to maintain momentum amid a decline in the number of protesters who have blocked key intersections in Bangkok for four days now in an attempt to shut down the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Their numbers could swell again this weekend. Yingluckís opponents, largely from the south and urban middle and upper classes, claim she is carrying on the practices of her billionaire brother by using the family fortune and state funds to influence voters and cement her grip on power. But she has widespread support among Thailandís poor majority in the countryside because of the populist policies carried out by her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid being imprisoned on a corruption conviction. On Wednesday evening, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban urged followers to march on the offices of the Revenue Department. Thursday morning, a column of flag-waving, chanting protesters marched off to surround three branches of the Revenue Department, asking workers inside to leave ó and many did. Last month, protesters had surrounded the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Transport Ministry and other government agencies, prompting some to move to temporary premises or allow employees to work from home. Other groups of demonstrators targeted the Public Health Ministry and at the Public Works Department. One group led by a Buddhist monk claimed to be headed to the office of the Department of Special Investigation,Thailandís FBI. The protests this week have been mostly peaceful, although there have been random acts of violence including gunshots in the middle of the night at protest venues. Overnight, a small explosive device was hurled into the residence of protest leader Issara Somchai Issara, damaging part of a motorcycle in the garage, according to Police Col. Pong Sangmurin. Since the latest wave protests started in November, eight people have been killed and more than 450 have been injured. Despite pressure from the protesters, Yingluck said Wednesday that the Feb. 2 parliamentary election will go ahead. She had dissolved parliament and called the early vote to defuse tension that has been building over the past three months. But her opponents donít want an election because they know that her rural supporters would almost certainly give her victory. Instead, they are calling for an unelected ìpeopleís councilî to replace the government and amend laws to fight corruption in politics. Yingluck told reporters after a meeting with members of her Cabinet, registered candidates and a top electoral official that there was no legal way for the Election Commission to delay it. ìThe rights of the people are important,î said Yingluck. She also had offered to meet with rivals Wednesday to discuss an Election Commission proposal to delay the Feb. 2 vote. But protest leader Suthep and the opposition Democrat Party refused to take part, saying reforms to get rid of corruption in politics must happen first. While the road blockages created traffic disruptions, life continued normally in most of Bangkok, a bustling city of 12 million. Thailand has been wracked by repeated bouts of unrest since the military ousted Thaksin in 2006 amid charges of corruption and alleged disrespect for the monarchy. The crisis boiled over again late last year after a failed ruling party bid to push through an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return from exile.

572,"Food inflation is a huge problem. It has, in different years, been concentrated in different items: sometimes cereals, sometimes proteins (dairy products, pulses, eggs, meat), sometimes vegetables. Skyrocketing global prices of wheat and maize after the mid-2000s have stoked Indian inflation too. The good news is that global wheat and maize prices have crashed spectacularly. In the Chicago market, the global benchmark, wheat was $8.50 per bushel for much of 2013, but has plummeted to $5.70 per bushel. Maize was $7 per bushel in early 2013 but is now just $4.30 per bushel. So, global trends that fanned Indian food inflation will now tend to bring it down. Talk of Chickenfeed. Will lower global prices be sustained? The chances look good. And, lower cereal prices will spill over into other foods. Maize is the biggest animal feed, so cheaper maize will slash the cost of everything from chicken and farmed fish to pigs and cattle, from milk to eggs. Wheat is also fed to animals, and lower prices will have similar effects. This will put downward pressure on other animal feeds like oilcakes ó soybean meal is down from $5.40 per bushel last autumn to $4.20 today. High-protein foods will become cheaper globally. India doesn't allow free import or export of farm items, so Indian prices often differ from global ones. Some analysts think Indian food inflation is driven mainly by politically-mandated rises in cereal prices, not by global trends. This is simply wrong. Global trends matter significantly. In the 1980s, when India sought self-sufficiency, Indian prices were largely delinked from global ones. But in the last two decades, India has become more closely integrated with the world. Earlier, India exported mainly non-food farm products like cotton, tea and spices. But in the last two decades, India has become a major exporter of foods: rice, maize, wheat, poultry products and beef. Call it Recoupling. Despite continuing controls on agricultural trade, global trends now have a big impact on Indian price expectations. Indian farmers and traders look up Chicago prices everyday, as these sway domestic price expectations partially, though not totally. It's politically impossible in a predominantly rural democracy to consistently pay Indian farmers less than global prices. This can happen occasionally, when global prices suddenly spike. But political pressures to raise minimum support prices (MSP) for Indian crops are high when global prices shoot up. Big increases in MSP since 2008 have been driven by the need to catch up with global prices after 2007-08. In the 1990s and early 2000s, wheat ruled at $3-4 per bushel, and maize at $2-2.50 per bushel. Those were days of excess global production induced by excessive subsidies. But the subsidies came down, especially in the EU. Meanwhile, buoyant economic growth raised food consumption in developing countries. China, above all, greatly increased imports of animal feed to support higher production of pork and other animal products. Globalfood prices started rising in 2005 and 2006, when wheat touched $5 per bushel and maize $4 per bushel. This culminated in a gargantuan spike in 2007-08. The big new factor was the sharp rise in biofuel use by cars and trucks in the US and Europe. The US mandated that ethanol must be mixed with petrol, leading to the diversion of one-third of US maize acreage to ethanol output. Europe decreed that 10% of diesel should be replaced by biofuels, leading to diversion of acreage to produce vegetable oils. This, along with poor harvests and rising Chinese demand, sent wheat to $14 per bushel and maize to $8 per bushel. Hold the MSP Horses. Then came the Great Recession of 2007-09, and agricultural prices crashed. But, after that, wheat stabilised at around $7 per bushel and maize at $6 per bushel in 2010. Then, in 2012, they briefly touched $8.50 per bushel and $7 per bushel respectively ó double the pre-2003 levels. Indian politicians could not double domestic prices overnight to match global trends. But they had to catch up in a phased manner. No government dared pay Indian farmers consistently less than foreign ones. Domestic MSP for wheat was raised substantially, year after year, from Rs 650 per quintal in 2006-07 to Rs 1,350 per quintal in 2012-13. Rice went up in tandem. That stoked food inflation. But today, worldwheat and maize prices have crashed. Many Indian farmers now get more than American ones. That is a good reason to go slow on MSP increases in coming years. This will, hopefully, be one structural solution to food inflation. There will bedarker consequences too. Lower global prices will hit Indian farm product exports, some of which may become uncompetitive. Caveats? Global prices could spike again if there are bad harvests, or viruses hitting chicken and pork production. On the other hand, the US has greatly reduced ethanol production from maize, and imports ethanol instead from Brazil. History shows that global agricultural price spikes are followed soon by rising production and lower prices. That bodes well for the future of food inflation.",Falling wheat prices and controls on MSP can rein in food inflation - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/swaminathan-s-a-aiyar/falling-wheat-prices-and-controls-on-msp-can-rein-in-food-inflation/articleshow/28811068.cms

But he will not endorse leaving bulk data in the custody of telecommunications firms, nor will he require court permission for all so-called national security letters seeking business records.

Alan Cowell Almost nine years after Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, was killed by a truck bomb, an international tribunal opened hearings into the case on Thursday in a courtroom in the Netherlands with lawyers and judges clustered around a mock-up of the crime scene on the Beirut waterfront. The prosecution likened the result of the attack to a ìman-made hell.î But notably absent from the Special Tribunal on Lebanon, in a former spy agency office on the outskirts of The Hague, were the four accused who have been shielded from arrest and prosecution by the powerful Lebanese Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah that supports President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in the civil war against mainly Sunni insurgents. The trial for the alleged suspects represents the first time that an international tribunal has tried defendants in their absence since the Nuremberg trials after World War II. Even if they are convicted, the four are entitled to a new trial if they are apprehended. The attack that killed Hariri and 22 others on February 14, 2005 convulsed the region and inspired huge protests against Syriaís influence in Lebanon. Even as the trial began, a car bomb exploded in a northeastern Lebanese town close to the Syrian border, killing three people ó the latest in a series of apparently sectarian attacks.

The next step is expected to be a presidential election for which Sisi, 59, appears the only serious candidate. Some 90 percent of the people who voted approved the constitution, state-run media reported. Al-Ahram, the stateís flagship newspaper, said the constitution was approved by an ìunprecedented majorityî, citing early results. The constitution won wide support among the many Egyptians who backed the armyís removal of Morsi. There was little trace of a ìnoî campaign as the state pressed a crackdown on dissent. Morsiís Muslim Brotherhood had called for a boycott, seeing the vote as part of a coup. An Interior Ministry official said turnout appeared to be more than 55 percent. It was the first vote held since Morsi was overthrown following the June 30 mass protests against his rule. A decree is expected within days setting the date for presidential and parliamentary elections, Al-Ahram reported. The official result is expected to be announced on Saturday. Nine people were killed on the first day of voting in clashes between Brotherhood supporters and security forces. The Interior Ministry said 444 people were arrested during the two-day vote. The authorities, who have billed the transition plan as a path to democracy, have also jailed moderate Islamists and secular-minded activists in recent weeks, including prominent figures in the 2011 uprising against President Hosni Mubarak. The referendum has been seen as a public vote of confidence in Sisi, widely viewed as the most powerful figure in Egypt and the man needed to restore stability.",í90% Egypt voters back constitutioní | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/90-egypt-voters-back-constitution/

The PM has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this urgently,î a UK government spokesperson said. ìThe PM and the Foreign Secretary were unaware of these papers prior to publication. Any requests today for advice from foreign governments are always evaluated carefully with full Ministerial oversight and appropriate legal advice,î he added. The documents being referenced were released by the National Archives in London under the 30-year declassification rule. A letter marked ìtop secret and personalî dated February 23, 1984, nearly four months before the incident in Amritsar, titled ëSikh Communityí, reads: ìThe Indian authorities recently sought British advice over a plan to remove Sikh extremists from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. ìThe Foreign Secretary decided to respond favourably to the Indian request and, with the Prime Ministerís agreement, an SAD (sic) officer has visited India and drawn up a plan which has been approved by Mrs Gandhi.

The row broke out after a UK MP claimed he possessed declassified documents dated February 1984, which ìrevealî that the then PM Margaret Thatcherís government had aided India by sending an advisor from the British SAS special forces on the request of the then PM Indira Gandhi. Lt Gen (Retd) K S Brar, who led the operation, said he is ìsurprised and aghastî at the claims. ìIt sounds like fiction to me. I can assure you that Operation Bluestar was planned and executed by the Indian Army. There is no question of any foreign, British assistance or the SAS planning the operations for us,î Brar, who survived a murder attempt by a Sikh group in London in 2012, told The Indian Express. ìI am very surprised that something as malicious as this has been brought out just when elections are due here. I do not know if this is politically motivated or a move to get the British Sikhs agitated once again,î he added. Jaitley, meanwhile, said, ìIt is about time the government of India decided to tell us the truthÖ This would enable people to conclude whether Operation Bluestar was a strategic miscalculation.î He reminded the government that ìin the next few months, more documents between the period February to June 1984 would become public on account of the expiry of the limitation of 30 yearsî.

Sectors such as technology, pharmaceuticals and metals are likely to drive earnings growth, say leading brokerages such as Merrill Lynch, Kotak Securities, Motilal Oswal and others. Sensex companies reported a robust 14.3% year-on-year growth in the September quarter (Q2 FY14) after posting 2% loss in each of the previous two quarters.

586,"MUMBAI: Among the Infosys executives who were ever even remotely in contention for the CEO post ó Mohandas Pai , V Balakrishnan, Ashok Vemuri and now BG Srinivas and UB Pravin Rao ó the last is perhaps the least known. Last week, when Infosys disbanded its executive council and appointed two presidents, BG Srinivas and UB Pravin Rao, many concluded that the race to succeed D Shibulal had narrowed down to just two. Though Rao has seen very little public limelight, he is well-regarded and respected within the company, present and former Infosys executives say. Industry sources say Rao, 51, was on the ball about the changes that the company needed urgently much before Murthy came back. In that sense, his rise within Infosys actually began even before NR Narayana Murthy returned as chairman in June 2013. ""Pravin was always more vocal about the changes that were coming,"" one very close observer of the company told ET on condition of anonymity. Rao had foreseen that the focus of the company would shift back to bread-and- butter large outsourcing contracts as many as 5-6 quarters before Murthy came back, the person said. The focus would shift away from consulting to business operations and margins would fall, Rao had anticipated. ""Everything he'd foreseen has come true,"" the person said. Yet, in all this, Rao mostly remained out of public glare. People who have worked with him describe him as self-effacing, but very capable. ""The retail (industry) vertical under Pravin (Rao) has shown steady growth despite being a sector that's very competitive,"" points out Subash Dhar, former head of innovation and sales of Infosys. Indeed retail, Infosys executives point out, was one of the first verticals within the company that started building solutions. In fact, many of the solutions, which are currently part of Infosys' Platforms, Products and Solutions play, are from the retail vertical that Rao led. ""Retail was way ahead in investing in solutions,"" adds Dhar. Outside of the co-founders, Rao is the closest who comes to being one. He joined Infosys just five years after it was founded and was still operating out of a twostorey building in the city. Back then, it was yet to achieve any of its early success. The electrical engineering graduate from Bangalore University was hired after being interviewed by NR Narayana Murthy and NS Raghavan . ""I joined Infosys at a princely salary ofRs 1,300 much to the dismay of my wellwishers, ignoring three other wonderful job offers,"" Rao recollected a few years ago, when Infosys completed 30 years. The other quality that comes up time and again in conversations about Rao is his people skills. S Swaminathan, former CEO of Infosys BPO, says he encourages dissent and discussion. ""He delegates well and carries his people along. These are qualities that stand out,"" says Swaminathan. Rao enables ideas to germinate under his leadership, adds Dhar. Over time, Rao has taken on several leadership roles such as head of infrastructure management services and delivery head for Europe. He was heading the retail, consumer goods, logistics and life sciences verticals before his promotion last week. A few months ago, he was given additional responsibility for Infosys Leadership Institute, a position that was lying vacant since Mathew Barney, its previous head, quit in March last. BG Srinivas or Ashok Vemuri (who quit Infosys to join iGate in September), were more client facing and were also located in Infosys' biggest markets . But Rao, who has mostly been based in India, to that extent, Rao has been less client facing, a criteria increasingly being considered as important to lead the business. But those who have worked with him refute the contention. ""At that level, there is nothing like a client-facing role or not. Retail has marquee clients like P&G ó it has been one of the fastest growing verticals for Infosys,"" points out one person. Other associates say Rao has been in difficult client situations and has stayed calm, dealing with the situation in a balanced manner. The other perception about Rao is that he is not ambitious. ""He's diligent and hardworking and a great thinker, but probably not as ambitious,"" says an analyst with an overseas brokerage. Rao was not part of the executive council when it was first formed. Rao has now been appointed to the Infosys board after former CFO V Balakrishnan resigned in December. The best praise for Rao also comes from people who were part of his team, ""Pravin (Rao) is a Guru in the setup. He is a person who can give you a strong direction. Nobody understands Infosys like he does.""",UB Pravin Rao: Infosys' President who had foreseen that company's focus would shift back to outsourcing deals - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/ub-pravin-rao-infosys-president-who-had-foreseen-that-companys-focus-would-shift-back-to-outsourcing-deals/articleshow/28566506.cms
587,"FROM THE SPIRITUAL home of the automobile industry to its boondocks.From the world's largest automobile company to a fledgling operation. That's the journey Pawan Goenka made 20 years ago, when he transported his family from Detroit to Nashik, and moved from General Motors to Mahindra & Mahindra. As journeys go, that was the beginning of one long ride. It's a ride that has seen M&M's auto business grow from Rs 400 crore to Rs 55,700 crore, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the group's revenues. And Goenka, an engineer by profession, has gone, step by step, from being part of a research and development team he joined on a leap of faith to being in operational charge of that entire auto operationóan assembly of six pieces. That last appointment, executive director of M&M, happened in September 2013. With it came more responsibility: additional charge of M&M's fledgling and struggling two-wheeler and truck businesses. And respect: Goenka was the first employee in the company to be elevated to the board in two decades. As Anand Mahindraóthe keeper of the Mahindra Group, and chairman and managing director of M&Móprogressively retreats from operations, Goenka is being entrusted with more as the implicit number two. He's earned it at M&M, feels V Sumantran, vice-chairman of Ashok Leyland , who has known Goenka since 1985 and worked wi th him at General Motors. ""He has a very disciplined way of running programmes, which has been missing in Indian companies,"" he says. ""Since he can run multiple programmes, nothing is a challenge. Even if he is a specialist, he has gone out of his comfort zone and made a continuous contribution."" Even beyond that, Goenka's mettle and acumen will be tested. He takes more charge at a time when parts of the auto industry are going through their worst slump in a decade. M&M's utility vehicle business, after a dominant phase, is under assault from rivals. Two-wheeler and trucks have to get going. Goenka, 59, iterates the big picture. ""Perhaps the most important thing is not to get derailed from the long-term plan set in place, and not let your stakeholders and your colleagues get into a 'losing the battle' frame of mind,"" he says. ""The current slowdown has come too quickly after the last one and has lasted a little longer, but there's no reason to press the panic button."" The R&D Years. In the past, he hasn't done so, notably at the time of taking the big decision to join M&M, in 1993. Bharat Doshi, director at M&M, was the man who sold the idea of the Mahindra Group, working in liberalised India and Nashik to Goenka. In the initial years, Goenka wasn't sure if he made the right decision for his family, especially his two young children, by uprooting them from the US. He promised his daughter that, after 18 months, if she wanted to move back, they would, no questions asked. ""She never said any such thing,"" says Goenka. Instead, after four years in M&M's Nashik plant, they moved to Mumbai, with Goenka spearheading the R&D business of M&M to launch the Scorpio, the SUV that would changed the company's DNA, image and fortunes. Goenka bought into a vision of Anand Mahindra, one that evoked, simultaneously, challenge and scepticism: to build an auto company, from scratch, that was self-sufficient in technology and products. ""That is the vision he laid out for me,"" recalls Goenka. ""I remember him telling me, 'I will give you a blank cheque and you give me an R&D that can develop globally competitive products in five years'. For an R&D person, there cannot be a better offer."" The first three years were about ""constructing"" R&D. ""We did not have experience, processes or even offices,"" says Goenka. ""Everything was done on the move."" The team worked on some lesserknown products such as Armada Grand. Bolero came in 2000, with an investment of just Rs 20 crore. But it was a pick up, developed by Goenka's team in 1998, that changed everything. It formed the basis for Scorpio, launched in 2002. ""When we showed the first Scorpio prototype to Anand, he instantly hugged several of us standing there and said, 'this is like a child being born',"" recounts Goenka. At the time, M&M was partnering Ford for cars, and Goenka made a presentation on the Scorpio to the Ford management team, from chairman down. ""They could not believe an Indian company was daring to do something like this for shoestring budget of Rs 600 crore."" The Operation Years. After the Scorpio, in 2003, Goenka moved out of R&D to become the chief operating officer of the auto business. ""He not only demonstrated his strong technical knowledge, but also excelled as a manager and a leader,"" says Doshi, a finance professional. ""What was impressive was his financial analysis and grasp of complex financial issues."" In 2005, when he became president of the auto business, he started reporting to Anand, who is the same age as Goenka. It's a close, easy and empowering relationship, says Goenka. ""Anand expects his presidents to take an entrepreneurial ownership of their business,"" he adds. ""While he is involved through some wellstructured reviews, he is willing to give as much time as needed by the presidents on a pull basis."" M&M's auto footprint has progressively become bigger. It has diversified into new segments: trucks, two-wheelers and cars. It has bought companies: South Korea's utility-vehicle company SsangYong, twowheeler manufacturer Kinetic Motors and Indian electric-car maker Reva. It has gone global. It is a leader in utility vehicles. Rakesh Batra, partner and national leader, automotive sector, Ernst & Young, points out that Goenka has been a ""strategist"" and a ""hands-on operationalist"", burnishing his leadership credentials. ""Goenka is a cool, composed thinker,"" says Arun Nanda, director, M&M. ""He is no micro-manager and gets to the root of the problem if he wants to. He has the vision to understand the big picture."" He has also dealt with reversals: like false starts in two-wheelers and cars, or the fizzling out of car joint ventures with Ford and Renault. Acknowledging those setbacks, Goenka sees them as learning experiences. ""These JVs have given us multi-cultural exposure and an insight into very different management practices,"" he says. ""With proper insights, we are able to take these experiences and blend them to come up with our own approach to business, which serves us well. We have become stronger in manufacturing, sourcing and product development."" The Management Years. Goenka will need all that strength, and more, to steer the company through the current tumult, consolidate the new businesses in its fold and stay the course on the vision he bought into. That longterm vision is why he dismisses talk of M&M driving out of the two-wheelers and trucks businesses. ""They are long-term bets for us and will test our mettle. They have a lot of potential like our core businesses,"" he maintains. ""At one point, nobody believed in new business such as Mahindra Holidays and Mahindra Finance. Today, these are doing unbelievably well."" Predicts Doshi: ""He wil l turn them around."" As president, in charge of more, a challenge before Goenka will be to keep switching between businesses. He has a team of business heads in place (See graphic: A Large Spread), and some advantages of legacy. ""The larger and mature businesses are very process-driven and do not require so much attention,"" says Goenka. ""It's the smaller businesses that will require more attention from me. Yet, my review time for a Rs 300 crore business or a Rs 3,000 crore business will be the same."" He confesses to enjoying R&D reviews ówhich take him back to his rootsóthe most. For Goenka, R&D, now headed in M&M by Rajan Wadhera, remains integral to his blueprint of a successful auto operation. At a recent seminar, he said that automobile wars are fought in R&D labs and not showrooms. ""Goenka possesses all the right skills an auto company would want in a CEO,"" says Sabarad of SBI Cap Securities. ""He has an understanding of complex engineering processes and also knows what the market wants."" While some in the industry see him as a micro-manager, he doesn't buy that appraisal, and sees himself more as a coach and a mentor. ""Just as I have independent charge of my businesses, I empower my team members to not only perform but take independent and mature decisions,"" he says. Deep Anand agrees with that assessment. As chairman of the Rs 6,000 crore Anand Group, an OEM supplier to M&M, he has engaged with Goenka. ""He (Goenka) is very upfront, provides valuable inputs on design and is a team builder,"" he says. ""Goenka and Anand Mahindra complement each other. While the former brings technology and manufacturing skills, Anand Mahindra brings the entrepreneurial skill.""",Pawan Goenka is Anand Mahindra's go-to man in Mahindra & Mahindra - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-company/corporate-trends/pawan-goenka-is-anand-mahindras-go-to-man-in-mahindra-mahindra/articleshow/28574893.cms

590,"NEW DELHI: German premium carmaker Mercedes Benz will start assembling its S-Class cars at its Pune plant in April, a top executive of its Indian unit has said. The company also plans to introduce new models in the local market this year as part of strategy to regain top position in its luxury car segment. Mercedes-Benz India, which sold 9,003 units in 2013, a 32% growth from a year ago, is the No. 2 luxury carmaker in India after Audi , another German company that sold a thousand more units. In the second half of 2013, Mercedes had taken the top slot and is now hoping to outpace the market leader again on the back of its new launches. The new S-Class, launched in India on Wednesday with a Rs 1.57-crore (ex-showroom Delhi) price tag, is currently imported into the country. About 70% of the Mercedes Benz cars sold in India are locally assembled. ""We have made huge investment in India for a local assembly and production plant. With a body and paint shop, we are able to churn out a substantial production from our Pune plant,"" Mercedes-Benz India CEO and MD, Eberhard Kern , said. ""The annual capacity has also been doubled to 20,000 units to meet our sales targets of the future."" Mercedes, which had introduced eight new models in India last year, is planning to enhance its local assembly operations to beat competition and fill the SUV deficit in its portfolio. In India, it assembles four car modelsóthe C-Class, E-Class, ML-Class and the GL-Class. The company is planning to introduce its globally successful GLA SUV and the CLA sports sedan in India to tap its growing affluent class. ""We are contemplating to get some new product in 2014 and backed by a strong production infrastructure in place some pleasant product surprises should be expected soon,"" Kern said. ""We managed to outsell our competitors on most of the segment we operate, and that to despite not having a full range of SUVs in our portfolio."" Mercedes Benz has already sold the 125 SClass launch edition cars allocated by its German headquarters for India. Deliveries of the locally assembled car, which will be available with both diesel and petrol engines, is expected to start in April.

With top notch institutes like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) also now trailing behind, the government is now toying with the idea of having them compete as a single entity ó representing the 15 institutes.

The special unit (SU), which acts as the CBIís intelligence wing and conducts background probe, will soon get modern equipment and legal interception techniques.

The Ministry of Minority Affairs is set to start three schools, modelled on the lines of the Kendriya Vidyalayas, in Kishenganj (Bihar), Ajmer (Rajasthan) and Mewat (Haryana) exclusively for students from minority communities. Each school, to be set up at an approximate cost of Rs 5 crore, will have a capacity of about 1,000 students. While the National Buildings Construction Corporation has already submitted the final plans for the buildings, the ministry does not want to wait. Efforts are on to start classes from the 2014-15 academic session in rented accommodation. ìAll status reports on minorities have always pointed out a need for better school education infrastructure for their children. That is why we will set up schools exclusively for these children through the Maulana Azad Education Foundation (MAEF). We are hoping to start classes from the 2014-15 session. When the school buildings are ready, the students can be shifted there. We are writing to all state governments for allotment of land ó at least five acres ó for the schools,î said Minority Affairs Minister K Rehman Khan. The MAEF ó a voluntary, non-political, non-profit social service organisation fully funded by the ministry with the minister as its ex-officio president ó was roped in to avoid controversy over the government setting up minority institutions. The MAEF will be the controlling authority for the schools. The Kendriya Vidyalaya model has been adopted because the 1,094 KVs have the highest success rate. In 2013, 100 per cent KV students cleared both the Class X and Class XII CBSE examinations. While the original plan was to start five schools, only the Bihar, Haryana and Rajasthan governments have offered the required land so far. The long-term plan, said Khan, is to open a school in each of the 200 districts in the country which have a high population of minorities. ìIf each school has 1,000 students, it would mean that if we cover all 200 districts, there would be 2 lakh minority students who pass out of school every year. That would be a good number to integrate into the workforce,î said Khan. According to data provided by the Ministry of Human Resource Development in reply to a Parliament question in March last year, only 13.31 per cent of Muslim children in the age group of 6-14 years were enrolled in schools in 2011-12.

594,"MUMBAI/BANGALORE: In order to make them look more pleasing, hotels are taking help from the very people they want to please the most ó guests. Indian and international hotels are increasingly taking suggestions from existing and potential clients to design their properties to make them more pleasing and customer-friendly. The strategy is helping them win customers, as well as save cost by cutting down on things that guests feel are unnecessary, say industry executives. Hotel rooms have been fundamentally the same in design for the past hundred years, said Sanjay Puri, founder and lead architect of Mumbai-based Sanjay Puri Architects. But today's tech-savvy guests have become more design-aware and expect both the basic and top-end amenities in their rooms. ""Ample charging outlets, sound proofing, complete blackout blinds and curtains are some of the necessities in the hotel that have stemmed from customer requests,"" he says. Puri's company has designed boutique properties like Chrome Hotel in Kolkata and Oceanique in Goa. Bars with dart boards and gaming consoles, retail outlets in lobbies and women-friendly rooms with extra security, full-length mirrors and jewellery boxes are among the facilities that some hotels are providing at budget prices after finding that their customers expect these. This strategy to reach out to the guests is coming at a time when the hospitality industry in India is going through a downturn. Average occupancy rate in India dropped to a decade-low of 58.3% in the fiscal year ended March, according to hotel consultancy HVS. ""The designing of a hotel involving guests is another way to engage with them as the chances of these guests coming and staying at that hotel are higher and so is the possibility of them referring the hotel to other guests,"" says Akshay Kulkarni, regional director of hospitality, South and Southeast Asia, at property consultant Cushman & Wakefield. When mid-market chain Keys Hotels its first property in Thiruvananthapuram, it took suggestions from 200 frequent users of budget and mid-segment hotels across the country to design it. On the basis of this survey, it provided dart boards, pool and gaming consoles in the bar. ""We were able to give the guests what they wanted,"" says Sanjay Sethi, managing director and chief executive of Berggruen Hotels , which owns the Keys Hotels brand. At the same time, the strategy helped the company keep expenses tight by using less space and construction and through lower operating costs. ""The initiatives helped to save about 10% to 15% of capital costs associated with building a hotel and increased operating cost efficiency by 20%,"" Sethi adds. International and luxury hotel groups are also engaging the guest to help design their facilities and services.

Shinde had last week made a statement that he would write to all state governments to set up review or screening committees to assess the role of minority youths languishing in jails on terror charges without trial. Modi hit back saying Shinde's suggestion was against the constitutional principle of right to equality before law. Summary. Modi had written to the Prime Minister saying Shinde's suggestion was against the constitution. Related. Dubbing as a ìbrazen attemptî to woo the minority community Home Minister Sushilkumar Shindeís remarks on minority youths in jails on terror charges, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi said it marked a ìnew lowî for the country. He also asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to advise his cabinet colleague not to focus his attention on minorities alone as ìprinciples at stakeî could not be sacrificed ìat the altar of political expediencyî. In a letter to Singh, the BJPís prime ministerial contender said Shindeís statement could send a wrong message about the countryís criminal justice system and have a demoralising effect on the law enforcement machinery. ìThe Home Ministerís concern is a brazen and callous attempt to woo the minority community and even the minority community will raise questions on the timing of such statements,î Modi said. ìThe suggestion (from Shinde) is unprecedented and marks a new low for the country. The principles at stake are far too valuable to be sacrificed at the altar of political expediency.î The Gujarat Chief Minister said, ìa crime is a crime irrespective of the birth marks of the criminal and his religious beliefs could not determine the guilt or innocence.î Shinde had last week made a statement that he would write to all state governments to set up review or screening committees to assess the role of minority youths languishing in jails on terror charges without trial. He said Shindeís suggestion was against the constitutional principle of right to equality before law. Modi also wrote that the suggestion was against the constitutional principle of right to equality before law. Shinde had earlier written to all state governments including Gujarat that ìstrict and prompt action against erring police officers should be taken where there is malafide arrest of any member of minority community. ìWrongfully arrested person should not only be released immediately but should also be suitably compensated and rehabilitated to join the mainstreamî. Modi said that the proposed directive for setting up review committees was against the provision of criminal law, which does not provide for any review committee for withdrawal of pending cases where charge sheets have been filed. ìOne cannot rule out the possibility of the trials getting delayed due to such illegal action on the part of the state if the courts were to find fault with such interventions made on extraneous considerations. If this were to happen, undertrial prisoners will end up being under incarceration for longer periods; thus achieving exactly the opposite of the purported objective,î Modi wrote. The Gujarat Chief Minister said the Home Minister should find a solution within the constitutional framework, while suggesting an acceptable solution could be to fast-track all terror cases. He also said Shinde should focus on monitoring the terror cases being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). ìIt would be interesting to know how many innocent youths are found to be wrongly implicated in these cases. I hope the Home Minister understands that every case of acquittal need not be a case of wrongful arrest and false/malafide implication,î he said.",Modi claims Shindeís suggestion to release minority men held on terror charges ënew lowí for country | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/modi-claims-shindes-suggestion-to-release-minority-men-held-on-terror-charges-new-low-for-country/
596,"NEW DELHI: This holiday season, for Christmas or for New Year, if you had gone out for dinner at some of Delhi's upscale markets - Connaught Place , Khan Market , Haus Khas Village , Malcha Marg, Sunder Nagar or Nehru Place, for instance - there is a good chance that you went to one of his establishments. There is also a good chance, even if you eat at his restaurants regularly, that you have never heard of him. Priyank Sukhija (34) is arguably Delhi's most successful restaurateur - with a business model that's exciting plenty of investors around the country. He runs 19 restaurants in the city (all but one are profit-making). His establishments span more than 100,000 sq. ft of prime real estate . Three more will open for business before April. His eateries are on track to clock Rs 100 crore in business this fiscal. He is planning ten more restaurants in two years. This year, he intends to open formats serving Indian food in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. There is a secret behind Sukhija's ability to expand so rapidly- a network of partners who are happy to invest in his ideas and let him run the show. Different people are partners in different projects. Bhupinder Singh Kochchar of the VI John group is a partner in some projects. NO PLANS FOR PE PLACEMENT. Amit Bagga of Bagga Link motor dealerships and Umang Tiwari of Delhi-based Tiwari Builders are his other partners. Because of Sukhija's recent track record, he says he is able to set good terms for himself in partnerships. He will bring 10% of the investment required, but will take 50% of equity. ""The rest is a fee for the privilege of partnering with me,"" Sukhija says, in all seriousness. But he does everything else, from executing the concept, hiring the chefs and the staff, and the day to day running of the restaurant. ""I only partner with people I have known for years. That way, if the place makes a loss, the partner doesn't turn on me,"" he said. Sukhija's gastronomic reach in Delhi is most visible in Hauz Khas Village, a chic market heaving with fashion boutiques and quirky eateries. Apart from the three-level Out of the Box cafe, which serves a wide range of dishes, he runs the Asian restaurant Fat Ninja, Fork You, which serves American, Italian and Tex-mex cuisines, Raas, which serves Pakistani cuisine, and Chamanlal and Sons, a quirky bar named after the legend of a lawyer who drowned in the Hauz Khas Lake. Strangely, Sukhija is not as well known as he ought to be even among the small circle of restaurateurs. ""I have never heard of him but I have eaten at Raas and I thought the food was good,"" said Anjan Chattarjee, the founder of Speciality Group of restaurants, which runs brands such as Oh! Calcutta and Mainland China. ""But if he runs 19 restaurants in Delhi, he is a rock star. It is unusual and it's great that he is creating new formats,"" said Chattarjee, whose company runs 107 restaurants in 23 cities.","Invisible restaurateur: 34-year-old Priyank Sukhija runs 19 eateries in Delhi, yet few have heard of him - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/invisible-restaurateur-34-year-old-priyank-sukhija-runs-19-eateries-in-delhi-yet-few-have-heard-of-him/articleshow/28571117.cms

Close on the heels of the Tehelka episode,an allegation of sexual harassment has hit the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) after a Delhi-based student working as a programmer complained against a senior film festival official. The complaint by the JNU student,which is lodged with the IFFI Director Shankar Mohan,has accused a senior festival officer of the rank of deputy director of making lewd suggestions in the form of indirectly asking for sexual favours. ìOn the night of November 16,2013,lewd suggestions were made by the said person in the form of indirectly asking for sexual favours,î says the complaint lodged on November 17. ìAs a result of the incident,I feel harassed and highly offended. Hence I would like to report this matter under The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,Prohibition and Redressal) Act,2013,î said the 25-year-old girl. The girl was in Goa at the IFFI venue on the assignment to assist the Soul of Asia and World Cinema sections. The girl has accused the officer of inviting her to his cabin at the Old Goa Medical College (GMC) building in the late evening and suggested that she should accompany him for a drink. The victim further has said the officer repeated his comments again despite her showing signs of uneasiness over his advances. Along with the sexual harassment complaint,the girl has also told the festival director about the officer allegedly misusing CCTV monitoring facility in his cabin for voyeuristic pleasure as the cameras were installed at the workplace where women are employed. Following the complaint,the IFFI directorate formed a three member committee comprising Nirupama Kotru,director (films) with Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry and two more women officials associated with the film festival. ìI was asked to depose before the committee and told them what had happened,î the girl,who has since resigned and left from the IFFI venue,told PTI over phone from Delhi. ìThe officer verbally apologized before the committee,but he did not mean the apology. There was no written apology from him and the committee informed me that the matter was settled as they have made some recommendations,î she said. The girl,who said that she felt deeply traumatized by the event,informed her family in Delhi who asked her to return home. She left Goa on Monday.

Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar Thursday ordered a preliminary inquiry into allegations that the founder and editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine, Tarun Tejpal ,had sexually assaulted a colleague during a media event in the state and promised action if the crime was established. Parrikar<U+0092>s announcement came a day after Tejpal said he was stepping down as editor-in-chief for six months to atone for the <U+0093>unfortunate incident<U+0094> after a young woman journalist working for the magazine accused him of sexually assaulting her in a Goa hotel on two occasions earlier this month,sparking national outrage. Goa Police sources said that they had written to Tehelka<U+0092>s managing editor Shoma Chaudhury <U+0097> to whom the woman journalist had complained about the alleged incidents <U+0097> and would also be sending a representative to meet her and seek the magazine<U+0092>s cooperation in the probe. Goa Police wants Tehelka to hand over all information in its possession related to the alleged incident. It is also looking for evidence at the hotel in Goa,including CCTV footage,to see if there is enough material to register an FIR,the sources said. <U+0093>We could have filed an FIR if the girl had registered a complaint. It need not be a signed complaint,even a telephonic complaint will be taken into consideration,<U+0094> Parrikar told reporters after meeting top state police officers. <U+0093>However,I have ordered a preliminary enquiry after going through the mail that was supposedly sent by the victim and is being circulated among mediapersons,<U+0094> he said,adding that he was getting a call per minute about the incident Thursday morning. The Chief Minister said that he suspected the alleged incident may have taken place in Goa when Tejpal made his announcement to step down Wednesday and ordered the probe Thursday after it was confirmed that it was alleged to have taken place in Goa. <U+0093>Since the criminal offence took place in the jurisdiction of Goa,the local police will probe it. The police have been instructed to obtain information about the authenticity of the victim<U+0092>s mail. Unless that<U+0092>s established,we can<U+0092>t use it as a primary complaint,<U+0094> Parrikar said. <U+0093>However,all corroborative evidences indicate that the incident did occur. For example,the letter of apology from Tejpal shows that he is indirectly admitting to the crime,<U+0094> Parrikar said,adding that he had met Tejpal <U+0093>casually<U+0094> in the past. He said the Goa Police would need some time to investigate since the alleged incident had taken place about two weeks back and the woman journalist was not present in Goa. In her complaint to managing editor Chaudhury,the woman journalist had claimed that Tejpal sexually assaulted her on two occasions during the <U+0091>Think fest<U+0092> event organised by the magazine at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Bambolim. She is said to have claimed that Tejpal had on one occasion pulled her into a lift at a five-star hotel and pressed buttons to ensure the elevator stayed in circuit and did not stop or open doors while he assaulted her. Tejpal allegedly tried to assault her again the next day,again by pulling her into a lift at the same hotel,the woman is said to have alleged. In response,Tejpal wrote to Chaudhury and claimed <U+0093>a bad lapse of judgment<U+0094> and <U+0093>an awful misreading of the situation<U+0094> had led to an <U+0093>unfortunate incident<U+0094> and that he had unconditionally apologised for his misconduct. Chaudhury had said the woman journalist had not filed a criminal complaint and that she,as well as other staffers,were satisfied with the action taken. However,NDTV reported Thursday that the woman journalist was disappointed by Tehelka<U+0092>s response to her complaint. <U+0093>To claim that other journalists in Tehelka are satisfied is false since my testimony has not been publicly circulated within Tehelka,only Tarun<U+0092>s letter of <U+0091>atonement<U+0092> has,<U+0094> NDTV reported her as saying. Later on Thursday,Chaudhury said in a statement that Tehelka had constituted a formal complaints committee,in accordance with Vishaka guidelines,to be presided over by Urvashi Butalia,eminent feminist and publisher,to investigate the case. Besides,Tehelka will ensure setting up a formal complaints committee,according to section 4 of the Sexual Harassment of Women (Prevention,Prohibition and Redressal Act,2013),<U+0093>an institutional mechanism that was sorely missing in Tehelk<U+0094>,she said. Separately,Tehelka also tweeted that Tejpal had not left the country. Goa police sources said they were focused on examining if they could register an FIR in the case and it would be simpler if Tehelka cooperated with the police. If not,they would explore other legal options. Recording the alleged victim<U+0092>s statement would also be crucial and the sources said they were hoping the woman journalist agrees to it. But legal experts said police could pursue the case even without her complaint. Parrikar said his government would go by the law.<U+0094> <U+0093>There won<U+0092>t be any leniency or excesses,<U+0094> Parrikar said,dismissing notions that the probe could be influenced by politics. <U+0093>Crime is never committed by taking permission from a political setup. You can<U+0092>t blame a political party for it,<U+0094> he added. He also said questions had been raised about how Tehelka could fund such a huge,non-revenue earning event at a seven-star hotel and authorities could look into it if the sexual assault charges are proved. Parrikar said such incidents were unfortunate but was confident they would not hurt Goa<U+0092>s image. <U+0093>Tejpal and the victim are not Goans. And the incident happened in a hotel. These are personal crimes and they can<U+0092>t be stopped by the police,<U+0094> Parrikar said.

Hours after rebellion within the Aam Aadmi Party came to the fore on Wednesday with Laxmi Nagar MLA Vinod Kumar Binny threatening to hold a tell-all press conference on Thursday, leaders of the BJP said they were in touch with four AAP MLAs, including Binny. The BJP, however, is not too keen to get involved in AAPís affairs, till the Lok Sabha elections are held, in the hope that the ìgovernment will collapse under the weight of its own contradictionsî. BJP sources said they were in touch with four AAP MLAs ó two of whom are from West Delhi. ìWe have been in touch with V K Binny from the day he spoke against AAP the first time. On that occasion, he had said he was upset because he was not made a Cabinet minister. But this was denied by his party leader Kejriwal,î a senior BJP leader said. The leader said despite being in touch with AAP MLAs, the party has decided not to take any steps as it feels that the AAP will face more rebellions in days to come. ìThe directions from the BJP brass are not to get involved in AAP affairs, but to keep ourselves in the know of all crucial developments in the AAP. If the present circumstances persist, they themselves will become the reason of their fall,î another BJP leader said.

The party is deviating from the main issues.î In response, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said Binny had been demanding crucial posts in the government and the party. ìBinny first came to me and asked for a ministerís post (on December 24) and then he came to demand a Lok Sabha ticket. I refused him. If he had a problem with me or the party, he should have voiced it in the meeting of the MLAs, but he did not,î Kejriwal said.

Now, the AAP government has ìdebarredî the firms from participating in government tenders for a year from January 8 for their attempts to ìderail the bid process, thereby causing loss to the government and harming public interest as the project has been substantially delayed and needy dialysis patients were denied the benefits due from this processî. The two companies, M/S Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and M/S Nephrocare Health Services Pvt Ltd, said they were reviewing the order and would appeal to participate in the re-tendering process since they raised legitimate concerns which had been construed as delay by the government. The order by Health Secretary SCL Das states: ìUnder the terms of Request for Proposal (RFP), the selected companies were supposed to respond within a week of their selection to officially accept the Notice of Award (NOA) and immediately start the process of setting up machines. These companies wrote to the Health department only on August 13, and expressed their inability to perform their obligations,î the order stated. According to the order, in two subsequent letters on October 23 and November 22 last year, ìthe selected bidder conveniently changed stand and attempted to seek clarification under the garb of want of clarity, whereas no clarity was required as the bid documents were adequately explicit and expressive and, further, no such issues were raised during the bidding processî. Sources said the two companies were issued showcause notices on September 18 when they did not start the process of setting up machines, where they were asked to explain why they should not be debarred from participating in government tenders for three years.

Private schools in Kashmir,under the cover of a status quo order from the High Court,have hiked the tuition and other fees by a substantial 15 per cent,which has left many parents worried. One of the leading private missionary schools has hiked the fees by Rs 350 per month,an increase of 18 per cent over the fees charged last year. In fact,the school has increased the tuition fees over the past three years by almost 100 per cent now. ìWhen my daughter got admission in this school in 2010,the monthly tuition fee was only Rs 1200. From this month onwards,I am supposed to pay Rs 2300 per month,î Mohammad Shafi,a parent,said. He said the transportation charges have also nearly doubled in the past three years from Rs 600 per month to present Rs 1100. ìThere has been no hike in transportation charges this year so far,î Shafi added. Fayaz Ahmad,whose two daughters are enrolled in a leading ëGirls Onlyí school of the valley,said the school management had thrown all government guidelines and the Supreme Court orders to wind. ìThere is strict ban on capitation fees or donations imposed by the Supreme Court. However,the school charged Rs 25,000 as donation and even gave a receipt for the same,î he claimed. Ahmad said the school management has affected an increase of 15 per cent in the tuition fees this year. The schools are also imposing annual sundry charges like development fees,library fees and medical fees. The schools are even putting the synonyms to good use. One of the schools has levied Rs 575 for ëExcursion and Extracurricularí activities and another Rs 575 per year as ëPhysical Training and Outingsí charge. Many parents are complaining that despite availing so many benefits from the government,including land at nominal rent,these private schools were fleecing the people in the naming of imparting quality education. The missionary schools in the valley have been given hundreds of acres of land in prime areas on a nominal rent as low as Rs 100 per acre for improving the education scenario. However,the schools are now seen as commercial enterprises which earn crores of rupees every year through donations,admission fees and exorbitant tuition fees. Acting on orders of Jammu and Kashmir High Court in a public interest litigation filed last year,the state government in May this year formed a committee headed by Justice (retired) Bilal Nazki to look into the fee structure and facilities provided by these schools. The mandate of the committee was to grade the schools according to infrastructure,quality of faculty and other services and suggest fees slabs for them. The committee failed to take off immediately as the government could not provide an office for it to start work. In the meantime,an organisation of private schools approached the court with the plea to quash the government order that led to formation of the committee. The High Court last month directed the state government to file objections to the plea within three weeks and ordered the parties to maintain status quo on the matter. ìWe had started the proceedings but the High Court has now ordered status quo,î Justice Nazki said. He said further proceedings will be carried out once the High Court issues some clear directions in the matter. Advocate General Mohammad Ishaq Qadri said while there are no clear directions from the High Court in the case,maintaining the status quo should have meant that nothing,including the existing fees,should change till further orders. ìThere is nothing in the orders that can stop the government appointed committee to continue the proceedings as the committee had started functioning before the petition was filed,î Qadri said.",15 per cent fee hike in private schools worries parents | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/education/15-per-cent-fee-hike-in-private-schools-worries-parents/

IIT should devise some strategy to attract under graduate to post graduate programmes,î he said while addressing the 44th convocation of IIT-Delhi. ìI understand that very few IIT graduates are pursuing specialised education leading to PhD or higher degrees.

604,"Related. Thailandís government stuck to a plan for a February election on Wednesday despite mounting pressure from protesters who have brought parts of Bangkok to a near standstill, and said it believed support for the leader of the agitation was waning. Some hardline protesters have threatened to blockade the stock exchange and an air traffic control facility if Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra does not step down by a deadline media said had been set for 8 p.m. (1300 GMT). The unrest, which flared in early November and escalated this week when demonstrators occupied main intersections of the capital, is the latest chapter in an eight year conflict. The countryís political fault line pits the Bangkok-based middle class and royalist establishment against the mostly poorer, rural supporters of Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former premier ousted by the military in 2006 who is seen as the power behind her government. Yingluck invited protest leaders and political parties to discuss a proposal to delay the general election, which she has called for Feb. 2, but her opponents snubbed her invitation. After the meeting, the government said the poll would go ahead as scheduled, and it derided the leader of the protest movement, Suthep Thaugsuban. ìWe believe the election will bring the situation back to normal,î Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkanchana told reporters. ìWe can see that the support of Mr Suthep is declining. When he is doing something against the law, most people do not support that.î AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ASSURED. Protest leaders say demonstrators will occupy the cityís main arteries until an unelected ìpeopleís councilî replaces† Yingluckís administration, which they accuse of corruption and nepotism. Thaksinís rural and working-class support has ensured he or his allies have won every election since 2001 and Yingluckís Puea Thai Party seems certain to win any vote held under present arrangements. The protesters want to suspend what they say is a democracy commandeered by the self-exiled billionaire Thaksin, whom they accuse of nepotism and corruption, and eradicate the political influence of his family by altering electoral arrangements. There were no signs of trouble at the two targets named by hardliners in the protest movement ñ the stock exchange and the central Bangkok offices of AeroThai, which is in charge of air traffic control communication for planes using Thai air space. AeroThai said it had back-up operations to ensure no disruption to air travel if its control centre was shut down. ìFor en-route services AeroThai has set up a back-up centre working parallel to our primary system,î company president Prajak Sajjasophon told Reuters. ìWe can assure you services will not be affected if protesters force our headquarters to shut down operations.î Suthepís supporters have blockaded at least seven big Bangkok intersections and are also trying to stop ministries from functioning, forcing many to remain closed, with civil servants working from back-up facilities or from home. Yingluck herself has been unable to work from her offices in Government House since late November. The protests could cost the economy as much as 1 billion baht ($30† million) a day, according to a survey by the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce. Demonstrators marched to the home of Energy Minister Pongsak Raktapongpaisal on Wednesday, carrying a coffin with his name on it, ASTV news reported. They handed one of his aides a note demanding that he cut LPG prices and resign, it said. According to the official Twitter account of National Police spokesman Piya Utayo, an off-duty policeman dressed in civilian clothes was attacked and had his gun taken off him by about 10 protesters at a rally near the Energy Ministry. ìRED SHIRTSî TO STAY OUT OF BANGKOK. The latest protests have been less violent than a spasm of unrest in 2010, when troops were sent in to end a two-month protest in central Bangkok by ìred shirtî Thaksin supporters. More than 90 people died during those protests. Thaksin, who turned to politics after making a fortune in telecommunications, redrew Thailandís political map by courting rural voters. He now lives in exile to avoid a jail sentence handed down in 2008 for abuse of power. In this upsurge of unrest there have been relatively few factional clashes. Government supporters said they held protests on Monday and Tuesday in provinces neighbouring Bangkok but had no plans to demonstrate in the city. ìAll we ask is that Prime Minister Yingluck does not resign,î said Worawut Wichaidit, spokesman for the pro-government United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship. ìIf (Suthep) and his group achieve their goal Ö the outcome would be similar to a coup, and we all saw what happened the last time there was a coup,î Worawut said, referring to instability and factional strife in the years that followed the last army takeover. It is widely thought that, if the agitation grinds on, the judiciary or the military may step in. The military has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy, although it has tried to stay neutral this time and army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha has publicly refused to take sides.","Thai PM Yingluck Shinawatra stands firm on election, says protests flagging | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/thai-pm-yingluck-shinawatra-stands-firm-on-election-says-protests-flagging/
605,"Related. A Chinese female doctor was given a suspended death sentenced on Tuesday for selling seven babies to human traffickers, a case that drew massive public outcry against the growing menace of child trafficking. Zhang Shuxia, an obstetrician with Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital in northwestern Shaanxi Province, is accused of selling seven babies, one of whom later died, to human traffickers. The 55-year-old accused used to persuade the parents of the babies to give up their ìsickî newborns, the Weinan Intermediate Peopleís Court said in its verdict. She told parents their infants had serious diseases and convinced them to give up the babies, the court said. Zhang has been sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. Suspended death sentences are normally commuted to life imprisonment in China. Zhang sold seven babies to child traffickers between November 2011 and July 2013, including a pair of twins, a judgement posted on the Weinan Intermediate Peopleís Courtís microblog said. Six of the babies were rescued, but one baby girl died. On July 20, a mother surnamed Dong suspected her baby had been abducted and reported the incident to police. Zhang is accused of falsely claiming that her child had a congenital disease, according to the court. ìZhang used her position as medical personnel to fabricate reports about the infants, saying they suffered from birth defects or diseases that were hard to cure. She abducted and sold several new-born infants, violating professional and social ethics,î the court said. It is not yet clear whether Zhang will appeal. Zhang and several other suspects were arrested after the most recent abduction case in July. The parents reported the case to police after they suspected their baby had been trafficked. The baby was found and returned to his parents in August. Police said they were still investigating 50 related cases, including 26 cases linked to Zhang, and several other suspects were in criminal detention, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Four other officials from the hospital are on trial for suspected dereliction of duty and are awaiting sentencing, the report said. Zhang received around 20,000 yuan each for several female babies, it added, while a male baby fetched a price of 47,000 yuan in 2011. Zhangís actions shocked people across China and exposed the flourishing underground child trafficking industry in the worldís most populous nation which follows one-child policy.",Chinese doctor gets suspended death sentence for selling babies | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/chinese-doctor-gets-suspended-death-sentence-for-selling-babies/
606,"Related. Egyptians are being asked to vote this week on a vision of their nationís future sponsored by the powerful military, a two-day election widely seen as a referendum on a likely presidential run by the countryís top general ó but held in a climate of fear and intimidation. An astounding 160,000 soldiers and 200,000 policemen were expected to deploy across Egypt on Tuesday and Wednesday to guard polling stations and voters following months of violence that authorities have blamed on Islamic militants. Supporters of Mohammed Morsi, the Islamist president ousted in a coup last summer, have said they would stage massive demonstrations and boycott the vote on a new constitution. In many ways, Egypt looks more like a country going to war rather than one preparing for what is supposedly a transition to democratic rule. The government and the overwhelmingly pro-military media have portrayed the balloting as the key to the nationís security and stability over which there can be no dissent. Hundreds of thousands of fliers, posters, banners and billboards exhort Egyptians to vote ìyes.î Posters urging a ënoí vote have led to arrests. ìThere appears to be a conviction among security officers that there should be zero accommodation for anyone who wants a ënoí vote,î said Heba Morayef, the Egypt director for Human Rights Watch. Authorities have threatened legal proceedings against the owners of cyber cafes, presses and stationery stores if they allow use of their facilities for the production of ënoí fliers or posters, according to security officials. They said police commanders have instructed officers to arrest anyone distributing leaflets or hanging banners against the draft charter. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in exchange for discussing security operations. ìWe are trying to mobilize the ëyesí vote. Anyone doing the opposite is a traitor and an American agent,î said Mohammed Hamdy, a politician and local dignitary from the city of Assiut, an Islamist stronghold with a large Christian community south of Cairo. In Washington, U.S. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday: ìWeíre deeply concerned by reports of ongoing arrests for campaigning for a ënoí vote on the constitutional referendum. We are also deeply troubled by reports that at least one individual was beaten during his arrest.î The referendum is the sixth nationwide vote since the 2011 ouster of longtime authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak, with the five others possibly the freest ever seen in Egypt. While unlikely to be stained by fraud, this weekís vote is taking place at a time when many of the freedoms won in the uprising that toppled Mubarak have vanished in the months since Morsi was removed after just one year in office. The government has detained thousands of Brotherhood members including Morsi and most of the groupís leaders. Recently, the notorious domestic security agency set up hotlines for citizens to report members of the Brotherhood, which the government has declared a terrorist group. For their part, Morsiís supporters have been waging near daily protests since the popularly backed July 3 coup that ousted him. The new charter, drafted by a liberal-dominated committee appointed by the military-backed government, would ban political parties based on religion, give women equal rights and protect the status of minority Christians. But it also gives the military special status by allowing it to select its own candidate for the job of defense minister for the next eight years and empowering it to bring civilians before military tribunals. The charter is in fact a heavily amended version of a constitution written by Morsiís Islamist allies and ratified in December 2012 with some 64 percent of the vote but with a nationwide turnout of just over 30 percent. The current government is looking for a bigger ìyesî majority and larger turnout to win undisputed legitimacy and perhaps a popular mandate for the military chief, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, to run for president this year. El-Sissi has yet to say outright whether he plans to seek the nationís highest office, but his candidacy appears increasingly likely every day. Covering preparations for the vote, Egyptian TV news channels have been airing images of top army commanders, including el-Sissi, inspecting thousands of troops lined up in full combat gear. Convoys of military armored personnel carriers and fighting vehicles are shown plying city streets en route to their deployment positions. The resolve of the Egyptian government to do everything it can to bring out the voters and get a comfortable ìyesî majority comes in the wake of a series of attacks attributed to Muslim extremists. In the six months since Morsiís ouster, there has been an assassination attempt on the interior minister as well as deadly attacks on key security officers, soldiers, policemen and provincial security and military intelligence headquarters. Morsiís supporters have labeled the draft charter a ìconstitution of blood.î In response, the government has put them on notice that it would deal harshly with anyone interfering with the referendum. ìThe resolve of the police will not falter until we realize the will of the sons of Egypt,î Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim said on Monday. ìMaximum force and firmness will be used to deal with any attempt to spoil this feast. We will not show leniency toward any action that touches the will of the Egyptian people.î",Egypt holds vote on new constitution in climate of fear | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/egypt-holds-vote-on-new-constitution-in-climate-of-fear/
607,"The India growth story took a knock in 2013 as growth slumped amid rising inflation, leading to a distinct cooling in the enthusiasm of overseas investors. Even the rural markets, which have picked up the slack when urban consumption slowed, have felt the pinch. Thomas Puliyel , president of market researcher IMRB International, spoke to Shambhavi Anand about the year gone by and why a turnaround doesn't look imminent. Edited excerpts: What is the outlook for consumption, retail this year? FMCG will struggle for some more time. And it will take some more time before we understand when it will start looking up. The steep inflation has affected it badly and recovery will take some more time. The service and manufacturing sectors will take little bit of time before they start growing again. For these sectors to keep growing, there has to be fresh investment which is lacking currently and also in times to come. Has the consumption story broken down in recent months? The last year (2013)was disastrous. In the retail industry, major investments were pulled out. And there are hardly any fresh investments lined up, especially from the foreign direct investment (FDI) point of view. Sectors such as FMCG (fast-movng consumer goods) and retail have also slowed down on account of price inflation. So the sentiments are low, both in terms of investments and consumer sentiments. It will take some time for growth to come back. Even 2014 might be slow. Does that meanIndia is the worst affected in the Asia-Pacific region? Our direct neighbours are also affected by some or other uncertainties. Sri Lanka has its economic problems, Pakistan has political uncertainties and Bangladesh has its own issues. China still seems to be growing but we will have to wait and watch. So India is not the only country in Asia to not grow. Has the slowdown hit the rural Indian market as well? Historically, rural India has done very well. The employment guarantee scheme, minimum procurement prices, effective marketing distribution services have ensured growth in the rural India. But of late, growth there has been a slowdown. This is primarily on account of inflation. Our estimates say consumption growth in rural markets slowed to 4% between January and September 2013 from 7% in the year-ago period. How has the advertising industry performed? What are its prospects for 2014? What are the prospects for digital advertising in the coming year? Advertising will most probably look upand grow at around 8-10% in 2014, which is twice the level at which it grew last year. Last year, advertising grew at the rate of 4% to 5%. This (year's growth) will mostly be on account of the money being spent due to elections and political advertising. Digital advertising will grow. Although it has started from a small base, growth on that front is sure. However, TV will remain as important as it is today. Digital will become important on account of the urban population which has embraced digital media well. Even outside metros and the big cities, the internet is being accessed massively through phones. More people in India use internet on phones rather than laptops and desktops. If tablets catch up, digital advertising will catch up even faster. Sectors such as financial products, banks and those meant for youth have used it and will continue to use it. They keep driving growth on this front. Digital will surely play a larger role but TV will remain to be important and dominant.",Advertising will look up in 2014 and may grow by about 8-10%: Thomas Puliyel - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/advertising-will-look-up-in-2014-and-may-grow-by-about-8-10-thomas-puliyel/articleshow/28767222.cms
608,"Though Indian markets have made a cautious beginning to the year and the emergence of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has thrown a new twist to the election tale, Peter Elston , head of strategy and asset allocation, Aberdeen Asset Management, which manages assets worth over $325 billion, and is one of the largest FIIs to invest in India, expects the BJP to come to power in the 2014 general elections unless there are major changes in the poll script. Elston has given a 'C' to the current UPA government in his report card and said in an interview with Biswajit Baruah that it's a travesty that India's GDP growth has fallen below 5% . Edited excerpts: Opinion polls suggest that BJP may emerge as the leading party in the coming elections. What do you anticipate, especially with the emergence of AAP, and how will the markets behave? It appears that a BJP-led victory is expected, which is probably reflected in the stock prices as well. Unless there's a huge change in the election outcome, I wouldn't expect the election to influence equity markets in a big way. In the long term, I think it's essential for India to reduce corruption among politicians. The US Federal Reserve has announced tapering: how do you think this might impact emerging markets, including India? Given that Fed's bond-buying boosted emerging markets, its tightening will no doubt have a negative impact on the emerging markets, including India. The question is, how negative? Since the Fed is still buying $75 billion worth of bonds every month, we suspect the impact to be minimal. But this may not prevent market participants from guessing that Fed's bond buying will end completely, though there's nothing to justify that since the US economy is still weak. FIIs have made a tepid start to 2014 after investing over $20 billion last year. What are the factors likely to influence foreign fund flows to the country? I guess the factors are common to all emerging markets, not just India. The obvious one would be the realisation that central banks' monetary policies in the developed world remain very loose despite the recent announcement by the Fed that it would start tapering bond purchases. I also think that Indian equities are very good value in the context of the country's excellent long-term growth prospects. While the price-earnings ratio may be higher than that of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, India has a lot to offer. Its working age population is still growing and the scope for productivity growth remains substantial. The government has announced a slew of reforms ó some populist, some market-oriented ó over the past year. What's your take? I would give the government a 'C' on its report card. It is a travesty that India's GDP growth has fallen to below 5%. With the right policies, this wouldn't have happened. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that inflation numbers will hold the key to monetary policy decisions. Do you expect interest rates to ease in 2014? To some extent, higher inflation is the result of India being in the early stage of its growth trajectory. But it also reflects the twin budget and current account deficits. Until these are controlled, or at least narrowed, monetary policy implementation will remain a challenge for the RBI. Which are the sectors you are currently overweight on? Are you betting on sectors linked to revival of the US economy? The sectorswe are overweight on are the same ones a year ago and the year before that; we are long-term investors and change our portfolios only gradually. A year back, we were overweight on information technology, but we have taken advantage of the rupee weakness and the strong sector performance to reduce the overweight substantially. Besides, overweights are the result of where we find good companies as well as good prospects for the sector. So, our big overweights are in cement and consumer staples.",Growth prospects make Indian equities good value bets: Peter Elston - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/growth-prospects-make-indian-equities-good-value-bets-peter-elston/articleshow/28721003.cms

Clamping down on insider trading activities, US regulator SEC has barred Indian resident Sandeep Aggarwal from the securities market as well as from being associated with any investment adviser. Aggarwal, who is a financial analyst, was charged last year by the US authorities for spilling confidential information about the deal between Microsoft and Yahoo to a portfolio manager at a hedge fund advisory firm. The Securities and Exchange Commission order, issued on January 8, follows Aggarwalís submitting an offer of settlement which has been accepted by the SEC. Aggarwal has been barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognised statistical rating organisation. Besides, SEC said he has been restrained from ìparticipating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stockî. Passing the order, SEC said it deems appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Aggarwalís offer. The regulator had charged Aggarwal for tipping secret information to a S A C Capital portfolio manager who had earlier been charged with insider trading. SECís amended complaint had alleged that Aggarwal, in July 2009, learned confidential details about the progress of negotiations concerning the formation of a partnership between two technology companies from an individual who worked at one of the companies.

Embattled Thai Premier Yingluck Shinawatra Wednesday asked anti-government protesters to unleash their angst at the ballot box as she insisted that elections were the best way to resolve the festering political crisis. Yingluck tried to deflect the growing mass anger on the street by saying her government is ready to move forward with national reforms, a key demand of protesters whose massive protest campaign have wracked the country for months. However, defiant protesters led by the opposition Democrat Party vowed to keep up their efforts to force the premier from office and install an unelected ìpeopleís councilî to carry out reforms before the February 2 snap polls. Early Wednesday, two persons were injured in a shooting incident, a bus was burnt and an opposition leaderís house was damaged in a bomb explosion, as protesters brought parts of Bangkok to a near-standstill under their ongoing massive campaign that entered the third day Wednesday. Yingluck, now caretaker prime minister, Wednesday held a meeting with about 37 parties to discuss the Election Commission (EC)ís suggestion to postpone the polls. She said the majority of participants insisted that the elections had to go ahead. The premier insisted the elections were the best way to solve the countryís escalating political crisis. ìIf people donít want this government they should go out and vote,î she said.

615,"Bangkokís central commercial district was swarmed by anti-government protesters Monday as part of a so-called ìshutdownî of the city, a largely peaceful demonstration that cut most traffic to Thailandís priciest real estate and most prestigious addresses. The protest targeted the heart of the cityís business district and was the boldest move in two months of protests against the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Protesters frustrated with what they say is a dysfunctional political system have issued some of the most radical political demands seen in Asia in recent years: the scrapping of elections scheduled for February, a hiatus for democracy and the formation of an alternative form of government involving an unelected ìpeopleís councilî that would replace Parliament. ìWe need to shut the capital to tell people that this government has lost its legitimacy,î said Uracha Trairat, a businessman who flew from Phuket to join the protests. ìThe government is now destroying itself.î The protest had echoes of a protracted demonstration three years ago that closed off some of the same areas of Bangkok and ended with a military crackdown that left dozens of people dead. There were no reports of violence from the protest areas by late Monday afternoon, and some observers said it resembled a car-free festival in the capital more than a serious threat to the government. But a radical and aggressive faction of the protesters threatened to take over the countryís stock exchange and air traffic control system if Yingluckís government did not step down by Wednesday. In making that threat, one of the leaders of the faction, Nitithorn Lamlua, said protest leaders had already been charged by the government with rebellion, so they ìcould not loseî. ìWe will fight until we win,î he said. The International Crisis Group, a research organization, Monday said the ìscope for peaceful resolution is narrowingî in Thailand and that the campaign to stop elections ìraises prospects of widespread political violenceî and could provoke a military coup. ìCompeting Thai elites ñ with mass backing ñ disagree fundamentally about how political power should be acquired and exercised,î the group said. Chadchart Sittipunt, the transport minister, asked protesters to ìthink of the countryî and urged them not to shut down the air traffic control office. ìThis is going beyond the expression of opinion in a democratic way,î he said.","Anti-govt protesters occupy central Bangkok district, call for total ëshutdowní | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/anti-govt-protesters-occupy-central-bangkok-district-call-for-total-shutdown/

Beginning January 20, Iran will for the first time start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium and dismantling some of the infrastructure that makes such enrichment possible, the US President said. ìI welcome this important step forward, and we will now focus on pursuing a comprehensive resolution,î he said.",Iran to get $4.2 billion of blocked funds in phases | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/iran-to-get-4-2-billion-of-blocked-funds-in-phases/
617,"Summary. To winter sports enthusiasts, Taos is best known for its challenging ski slopes. But this northern New Mexico town has plenty more to offer visitors year-round, on and off the slopes. A hipper little sister of sorts to Santa Fe, Taos is known for its diverse outdoor offerings as well as its funky town square packed full of history, art galleries and Hispanic and Native American culture. Whereas Santa Fe is known for its wealth, Taos is lower-key and tends to attracts a younger, more starving-artist-type crowd. Itís a town where new-age nomadic hippies, (referred to locally as îsage monkeysî) peacefully coexist with artists, natives, daredevil skiers and even wealthy Texan tourists. Here are five free things to do and see on your next trip to Taos. RIO GRANDE GORGE BRIDGE. This steel deck arch bridge spans one of New Mexicoís most scenic vistas. Located about 10 miles (17 kilometers) northwest of Taos along U.S. 64, the famous bridge sits high above New Mexicoís mini-Grand Canyon, though just how high varies depending on whom you ask, with the state Department of Transportation saying 600 feet (183 meters). The adjacent park offers plenty of parking for those who want to walk across the bridge, visit vendors or enjoy walking trails that offer stunning views of the gorge and the river far below. Also nearby are the Stagecoach Hot Springs, aka îhippie holes.î About a 15-minute hike down a path at the end of Tune Road, the pools are located along the edge of the river in the ruins of an old stagecoach stop. With water temperatures of about 97 degrees F (36 C), they are a year-round favorite. Clothing is optional. SAN FRANCISCO de ASIS. Just 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) south of Taos, in the village of Ranchos de Taos sits in what is arguably one of the most painted and photographed churches in the world. Built between 1772 and 1816, the traditional adobe, mud and straw Spanish mission structure is synonymous with New Mexico, made famous by painter Georgia OíKeeffe and photographers Ansel Adams and Paul Strand. OíKeeffe described it as îone of the most beautiful buildings left in the United States by the early Spaniards.î The church is a National Historic Landmark and a World Heritage church. ARROYO SECO. Called simply Seco by locals, this village is about 7 miles (11 kilometers) east of Taos on the road to the ski valley. On warm days, you might find local potters working on their wheels along the main street. Just off State Road 150, north of the Abominable Snowmansion hostel, youíll find a traditional, colorful northern New Mexican neighborhood cemetery (photography is frowned upon). Each Fourth of July, you can join thousands of locals from surrounding areas to watch one of New Mexicoís homegrown Independence Day parades, complete with Western themes, horseback riders, even a popular grill-themed float that tosses out hundreds of pre-cooked and dressed, foil -wrapped hot dogs to the eager crowd. After the parade, the street party continues with live music and general revelry along 150. EARTHSHIP COMMUNITY. Just a little more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) up the road from the gorge is Tres Piedras, home to a colony of self-sustaining homes that look like spaceships embedded in the scenic landscape. There are about 70 homes in the 633-acre (256-hectare) subdivision, all made from all recycled materials. There are no water lines, power lines or sewer lines and lot owners are not allowed to drill wells. All water comes from the rain and snow that land on the roof. And sewage systems are self-contained. The community is also the headquarters of one of the early leaders in the sustainable building movement, Earthship Biotecture. There is a center where visitors can learn more about the movement, as well as nightly rentals for those who want to experience truly sustainable living. MABEL DODGE LUHAN HOUSE. Walk through the home of the unofficial founder of Taosí artistic and intellectual community. A salon hostess married to a Taos Pueblo Indian, Mabel Dodge Luhan moved to Taos in 1919 and is credited with luring writers and artists to the Land of Enchantment by sending invitations to people she barely knew. OíKeeffe and Adams were among those who accepted and came to hang out at the now historic inn, along with novelist Willa Cather, painter John Marin and writer D.H. Lawrence.

Answering a specific question about his opinion of Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi, at the Club Grounds here, where he was conducting a 'Divya Utsav cum Mahastasang' he said that he is not at all acquainted with Rahul Gandhi and hence had ""no opinion"" on him, but informed that he had met Narendra Modi a couple of times and ""he appears to be a good man"". He also said that coalition governments have proved to be a failure in governance and hence ""a single party government with majority"" is the need of the hour. When asked about his opinion about the Aam Admi Party (AAP) as an alternative to existing political parties at Centre, he said that though AAP appears to be honest in providing corruption free governance, it lacked experience. ""It is like giving keys to a driver with learning license to drive the vehicle in difficult terrain. Hence it is better to wait for some more time to analyse its performance.

619,"LONDON: Leading NRI industrialist and peer Lord Swraj Paul today called on the UK government to support enterprise to maintain the upturn in the economy. In a speech in the House of Lords, Lord Paul praised a ""heartening"" recovery in the economy but warned that the ""growth will continue to struggle"". ""As someone who is involved with the manufacturing industry, I am keenly aware of the fragility of this current upturn. In the automotive sector, for example, we have seen recent international success for the UK plants of Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan; yet for most other UK car plants, market conditions remain challenging,"" said the chairman of the Caparo Group of industries. He was addressing a discussion in the Lower House of Parliament here called to ""ask Her Majesty's government what direct measures they are taking to promote enterprise and the international competitiveness of British business"". Lord Paul went on to highlight the lack of skilled workforce in the manufacturing sector. ""Even for those that can sell their products in this sector, skilled engineers are hard to find and working capital to fund growth remains difficult to secure... Most of these businesses have been unable or unwilling to risk investing in new productive capacity in the last few years. ""They are now feeling more confident to invest , but how are they going to find the capital and skilled labour to allow them to do this?"" Turning to the financial sector, Lord Paul warned of a continuing shrinking of loans. ""I welcome the initiatives of the government in setting up the British Business Bank, and wish the recently appointed chairman every success in investing the 1.25 billion pounds that the government has set aside. But this may be too little, too late. Germany's KfW, upon which I believe the British Business Bank is based, invested over 17 billion euros in Germany's Mittelstand companies in the first nine months of 2013 alone,"" he said. As a solution, he stressed on the need for a true partnership between the government, academia and manufacturers. ""If we are to compete in international markets , the government and financial sector need to work together now to provide easily accessible funding solutions to support investment in our economy. Tax incentives for lease finance providers, coupled with enhanced investment allowances for manufacturers, could be considered,"" he said. Lord Paul cautioned that uncertainty around the proposed EU vote in 2017 and the upcoming Scottish referendum are adding to a climate of uncertainty.

620,"Related. The largest federation of unions in the US has expressed displeasure over the State Departmentís decision to accord full diplomatic immunity to senior Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade which prevented federal prosecutors to try her in a court on charges of visa fraud and misrepresentation of facts. The AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, however, applauded the Department of Justice, particularly US Attorney Preet Bharara, for its steadfast pursuit of justice in this case. ìThe indictment of the consular officer itself a rare occurrence is a positive step in the movement to uphold the rights of domestic workers. However, when the US Attorney presented the charges, it was revealed that the Department of State recently granted Khobragade diplomatic immunity allowing her to return to India,î Trumka said in a statement. ìWe are deeply disappointed by the State Departmentís decision to reaccredit Khobragade to the United Nations, which positioned her to be shielded by full diplomatic immunity,î he said. Too often immigrant workers are recruited to the United States on a myriad of temporary work visas and find themselves tied to an unscrupulous employer, working far more hours for far less than originally agreed upon, he added. International officers should be held to a higher standard, yet instead they have frequently been able to skirt charges of abuse and fraud in the A-3 visa category for personal employees of foreign officials using diplomatic immunity, he asserted. Trumka said the labor movement will continue to stand with Sangeeta Richard ñ the maid of Khobragade ñ as she and her family adjust to life in the United States after their trauma. Richard has alleged that she was underpaid and the contracts were violated by Devyani, which has been dismissed by the Indian diplomat. ìThe AFL-CIO will work to ensure the US government applies the full range of protections for domestic workers required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and urges the Department of State to closely scrutinize the officials who utilize the A-3 visa program. ìThe Department should also consider taking action against governments that routinely misuse the program, like India,î Trumka demanded. ìThe fight for justice is far from over, but this prominent indictment should send a message to other exploitative employers, regardless of their rank or status, that these abuses will not be ignored,î he said.

621,"A councillorís lonely fight for genetically modified†crops. Summary. From the moment the Bill to ban genetically engineered crops on the island of Hawaii was introduced in May, it garnered more vocal support than any the County Council in Kona, Hawaii, had ever considered, even the perennially popular bids to decriminalise marijuana. Public hearings were dominated by recitations of the ills often attributed to genetically modified organisms, or GMOs: cancer in rats, a rise in childhood allergies, out-of-control superweeds, genetic contamination, overuse of pesticides, disappearance of butterflies and bees. Like some others on the nine-member council, Greggor Ilagan was not sure at the outset of the debate exactly what genetically modified organisms were: living things whose DNA has been altered, often with the addition of a gene from a distant species, to produce a desired trait. But he could see why almost all of his colleagues had been persuaded of the virtue of turning the island into what the Billís proponents called a ìGMO-free oasisî. ìYou just type ëGMOí and everything you see is negative,î he told his staff. Opposing the ban seemed likely to ruin anyoneís re-election prospects. Yet doubts nagged at the councilman, who was serving his first two-year term. The islandís papaya farmers said an engineered variety had saved their fruit from a devastating disease. A study purporting that a diet of GMO corn caused tumours in rats, mentioned often by the banís supporters, turned out to have been thoroughly debunked.And University of Hawaii biologists urged the council to consider the global scientific consensus, which holds that existing genetically engineered crops are no riskier than others. ìAre we going to just ignore them?î Ilagan wondered. Urged on by Margaret Wille, the banís sponsor, who spoke passionately of the need to ìact before itís too late,î the council declined to form a task force to look into such questions before its November vote. But Ilagan, 27, sought answers on his own. In the process, he found himself wrestling with a subject in which popular beliefs often do not reflect scientific evidence. At stake is how to grow healthful food most efficiently, at a time when a warming world and a growing population make that goal all the more urgent. With the GMO Bill, Ilagan often despaired of assembling the information he needed to definitively decide. Every time he answered one question, it seemed, new ones arose. Popular opinion masqueraded convincingly as science, and the science itself was hard to grasp. People who spoke as experts lacked credentials, and GMO critics discounted those with credentials as being pawns of biotechnology companies. So many emails arrived in support of the ban that, as a matter of environmental responsibility, council clerks suspended the custom of printing them for council members. College students, eco-conscious shoppers and talk show celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Dr Oz and Bill Maher warned against consuming food made.",A councillorís lonely fight for genetically modified crops | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/a-councillors-lonely-fight-for-genetically-modified-crops/
622,"Summary. Akshay Kothariís first assignment at D school ó formally known as Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University ó was to rethink how people eat ramen noodles. His last D school assignment led to a news-reading app that was bought by LinkedIn for $90 million. While the projects had different end products, they had a similar starting point: focusing on how to ease peopleís lives. And that is a central lesson at the school, which is pushing students to rethink the boundaries for many industries. At the heart of the schoolís courses is developing what David Kelley, one of the schoolís founders, calls an empathy muscle. Inside the schoolís cavernous space, the students are taught to forgo computer screens and focus on people. So far, that process has worked. In the eight years since the design school opened, students have churned out dozens of innovative products and start-ups. They have developed original ways to tackle infant mortality, unreliable electricity and malnutrition in the third world, as well as clubfoot, a common congenital deformity that twists a babyís feet inward and down. The school has become one of the most highly sought destinations at Stanford. Some of the most popular classes get four times as many applicants as there are seats available. D school is adding full courses and ìpop-upî classes, focusing on more narrow problems. The aim is to give students tools to change lives. One emphasis is to get students to leave campus and observe people as they deal with lifeís messy problems. That is how Kothari, a mechanical engineering graduate student, started his ramen project. He spent hours at local ramen shops watching and talking to patrons as they inevitably spilled broth and noodles. Together with a group of students, he built a prototype for a fat straw that would let patrons have their ramen and drink it, too. The school challenges students to create, tinker and relentlessly test possible solutions on their users ó and to repeat that cycle as many times as it takes ó until they come up with solutions that people will actually use. An important element of the school is having students start small, and as they gain ìcreative confidenceî with each success, they can move toward bigger, seemingly intractable problems. One of D schoolís most highly sought courses is ëDesign for Extreme Affordabilityí. Over two quarters, students team up with partners from around the world to tackle their real-world problems. So far, ëExtremeí students, as they are called, have completed 90 projects with 27 partners in 19 countries. This year, students will work with partners in Cambodia, India, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Africa. One of Extremeís more successful projects is Embrace, a low-cost miniature pouch, not unlike a sleeping bag, that helps prevent newborns from developing hypothermia.

623,"Summary. She evokes genuflection from designers and has pop stars for friends. Now the founder of online luxury retailer Net-a-Porter, Natalie Massenet, is moving to print. When Natalie Massenet ascended the stairs of the Carnegie Hall stage in New York recently to accept a Woman of the Year trophy from Glamour magazine, she outdid Jennifer Lawrence at the 2013 Oscars ceremony, nearly tripping on her Alessandra Rich white lace gown (soon available for upward of $3,000 at Net-a-Porter, the online luxury retailer she founded). Time froze. The honoree swayed. Gasps filled the audience, as presenters struggled to disentangle Massenet from her dress. ìDeath by stiletto,î she joked limply after reaching the podium. It was a rare awkward moment for a woman who has evolved from scrappy Internet pioneer, peddling designer clothes out of a small apartment in Londonís Chelsea neighbourhood, to consolidating a power of unusual breadth over the fashion industry. In 2010, Massenet sold a majority stake in Net-a-Porter to the Swiss holding company Richemont, remaining executive chairman; her brand extensions include the Outnet, a discount site, and Mr Porter for men, all winging their wares to customers within days, sometimes hours, via branded black vans. A year ago, she was appointed chairwoman of the British Fashion Council. And while publications like Glamour, Vogue and Harperís Bazaar turn cartwheels trying to figure out new media, this month the hyper-wired Massenet, 48, is expected to oversee the introduction of Porter: a magazine to be sold on newsstands. ìItís a big beast,î said its editor, Lucy Yeomans, formerly of Harperís Bazaar UK, promising ìlots of journalismî and 50 pages of features. ìHere you have a woman who created something that didnít exist,î says Roopal Patel, a fashion consultant who formerly worked for Moda Operandi, fondly recalling Net-a-Porterís unexpectedly rapid delivery of a one-shouldered red Acme dress for a wedding. The Net-a-Porter group employs almost 3,000 people who work in London, New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai as well as less glamorous centres on the outskirts of the cities, where items are shrouded in plastic, plucked by robotic arms and rolled down conveyor belts before landing at wrapping stations. Christened Natalie Rooney, Massenet was an only child. Her parents split, and she went to live with her father in Los Angeles, coveting Ditto jeans in a rainbow of colours and plastic shoes. Her first job was at GHQ, a small menís clothing store in Los Angeles. She gave a male colleague rides to work, where they would listen to cassette recordings of songs he had written. ìHe was like, ëIím going to be a starí, and I was like: ëThatís great!,î Massenet says dryly. He was Lenny Kravitz. During a year spent modelling in Tokyo, she met pop singer Bryan Adams, who is now a good friend, and Elvis Costello.

624,"Reinventing†Batman. Summary. On the first page of the recent Batman No 24, the Caped Crusader does not swoop high above Gotham City, and the Joker does not stalk dark alleys. But it is one of the best moments ever in a Batman comic. In this tender scene, Bruce Wayneís butler and mentor, Alfred, is giving him a pre-battle buzz cut. ìHow do I look?î he asks Alfred. ìAerodynamic, sir.î That haircut and exchange capture the essence of the bond between the two men in just five panels. It also distills how the writer Scott Snyder has reinvented Batman in the past two years, deepening and humanising the Dark Knightís myth ó in the making since 1939 ó like no one since Frank Miller in the 1980s. ìItís essential, the lifeblood of our company, to reinvent cultural icons,î says Dan DiDio, a publisher of DC Entertainment, referring to Batman. ìAnd Scottís tone is unique. It has more of a horror feel. His Joker plays more like a slasher movie.î Snyder, 37, began as a writer of short fiction, publishing in literary magazines like Tin House and Zoetrope. His first collection, Voodoo Heart (Dial, 2006), got starred reviews in Publishers Weekly and Booklist, and Stephen King compared it to T Coraghessan Boyleís debut collection, If the River Was Whiskey. But comic books were his first and truest love. ìThere hasnít been a better time in comics,î Snyder says. ìThereís a more literate readership now.î One thing that sets apart Snyderís Batman (which is drawn with subtle power by Greg Capullo) is how he layers the labyrinth of history ó both of Gotham and of Bruce Wayneís family. ìHistory is a touchstone of everything I do,î says Snyder, who grew up in New York. Snyderís grandparents helped cultivate his taste for history and tale-telling as a boy by taking him to antiques shows. ìIf you got something,î he recalls, ìyou had to make up a story about the object.î Jim Lee, DCís other publisher, says, ìIt feels so elegant and organic the way Scott has added new concepts to a decades-old mythology.î That approach is on display in the comicís current arc, Batman: Zero Year, which focuses on how Bruce Wayne became ìthe Batî. Snyder will also oversee a new weekly Batman series coming this spring, Batman Eternal. But before Batman, Snyder showed off his comics-writing chops on American Vampire, which won a 2011 Eisner Award for best new series. Skinner Sweet is not some sun-fearing, caped aristocrat, but a down-and-dirty American vampire, who is powered by the sun, not afraid of it. The comic grew out of his impatience with current incarnations of vampires ó theyíve ìbeen turned into such romantic figuresî. He decided to counter the image with a rough-and-tumble homegrown vampire, kind of a Clint Eastwood with fangs. The way Snyder uses language also sets him apart from other comics writers ó appropriate enough for a writer who received a masterís d.",Reinventing Batman | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/reinventing-batman/

When a ship carrying scientists and adventure tourists became stuck in ice in the Antarctic late last month, climate change sceptics had a field day. On social media sites, they pointed out that a group whose journey was meant to highlight the effects of global warming was trapped by a substance that was supposed to be melting. ìGlobal warming idiots out of danger,î one noted when the shipís 52 passengers were taken to safety by helicopter after more than a week on the ice. The episode had little connection to climate change ó shifting winds had caused loose pack ice to jam against the ship ó and this was far from the first time that a ship had been trapped, even in the Antarctic summer. But sea ice cover in the Antarctic is changing, and scientists see the influence of climate change, although they say natural climate variability may be at work, too. ìThe truth is, we donít fully understand whatís going on,î said Ted Maksym, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Unlike the Arctic, where sharp declines in recent decades in the ice that floats on sea surfaces have been linked to warming, sea ice in the Antarctic has increased, scientists who study the region say. Averaged over the entire Antarctic coast, the increase is slight ó about 1 per cent a decade. At the same time, larger increases and decreases are being seen on certain parts of the continent. ìWeíre constantly struggling against that statement, that Antarctic ice is increasing,î said Sharon E Stammerjohn, a scientist at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. ìIt misses key changes that are happening. And there are really strong climate signals in those changes.î Most of the sea ice changes are occurring in an area covering about a third of the Antarctic coast, from the Ross Sea to the Bellingshausen Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula, said Paul Holland, a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey. Areas around the Ross Sea have seen large increases in ice, while in the Bellingshausen and along the peninsula, ice cover has declined sharply. Researchers agree that the changes in those seas are related to north-south winds that circulate clockwise around a stationary zone of increasingly lower-pressure air. That brings warmer air from the nor.","Sea change in Antarctic, or is it just a debate? | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/sea-change-in-antarctic-or-is-it-just-a-debate/

Islamic† extremist groups in Syria with ties to al-Qaeda are trying to identify, recruit and train Americans and other Westerners who have travelled there to get them to carry out attacks when they return home, according to senior American intelligence and counter-terrorism officials. These efforts, which the officials say are in the early stages, are the latest challenge that the conflict in Syria has created, not just for Europe but for the US, as the civil war has become a magnet for Westerners seeking to fight with the rebels against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. At least 70 Americans have either travelled to Syria, or tried to, since the civil war started three years ago, according to the intelligence and counter-terrorism officials ó a figure that has not previously been disclosed. FBI director James B Comey Thursday said tracking Americans who have returned from Syria had become one of the bureauís highest counter-terrorism priorities. ìWe are focused on trying to figure out what our people are up to, who should be spoken to, who should be followed, who should be charged,î Comey said to reporters. Fearing the handful of Americans who have returned to US pose a threat as they may have received extensive training and jihadist indoctrination, the FBI is conducting costly round-the-clock surveillance on a small number of these individuals, according to the officials. ìWe know al-Qaeda is using Syria to identify individuals they can recruit, provide additional indoctrination so theyíre further radicalized, and leverage them into future soldiers, possibly in the US,î said a senior counter-terrorism official. In Europe, where larger numbers are leaving for Syria, officials share the same concern and are working closely with US authorities to coordinate measures to stem the flow and track those who return. Analysts say at least 1,200 European Muslims have gone to fight since the start of the civil war. In a confidential memo on Nov. 26, Gilles de Kerchove, the European Unionís counter-terrorism co-ordinator, warned that ìthe first returnees have come back, and there are cases where individuals continue travelling back and forth.î",Qaeda in Syria trying to recruit Americans for attacks on US | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/qaeda-in-syria-trying-to-recruit-americans-for-attacks-on-us/
627,"Related. A former Yemeni bodyguard of slain al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, under detention at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba for more than a decade, has been cleared for release by a US government review panel. Mahmud Mujahid, 33, who allegedly underwent militant training at a secret camp in Afghanistan, is no longer a ìsignificant threatî to the US and is eligible for transfer from the prison at some point, the board decided. The decision by the board was the first in a series of review hearings that the Obama administration is holding to speed up the eventual closure of the US military prison for terrorist detainees, the Pentagon announced Thursday. He has been a captive at Guantanamo since his arrest near Afghanistanís Tora Bora mountains when US troops were closing in on a Bin Laden hideout not long after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Los Angeles Times reported. Mujahid had been accused of being an al-Qaeda fighter and bodyguard to Bin Laden Bin Laden was killed in a covert US raid in May, 2011, in Pakistanís garrison city Abbottabad. At one time, he was considered a ìhigh riskî al-Qaeda fighter and ìa committed jihadistî. The review board hearing for Mujahid was conducted behind closed doors under a 2011 directive by President Barack Obama to facilitate releases at Guantanamo. The Pentagon held it in secret to test how the process would work. Of the 155 detainees at Guantanamo, 77 are cleared for release and 70 are likely to undergo review hearings this year. ìThis is just the first of many reviews that must take place in order to finally close Guantanamo,î Dixon Osburn of Human Rights First, an advocate for detainees, was quoted as saying by the daily. Obama has promised to shut the prison, but his efforts have been hampered by some in Congress and by difficulties in finding foreign nations willing to accept the detainees. In changing Mujahidís status, the Pentagon said ìby consensusî the review members found that continuing to hold him indefinitely was no longer needed ìto protect against a continuing significant threat to the USî. Mujahid is now eligible for transfer to the country which will accept him, subject to appropriate security measures and assurances of humane treatment. According to Pentagon records assessing Mujahid in 2008, he was captured with a group of al-Qaeda fighters known as the ìDirty 30î on December 15, 2001, by Pakistani forces as the group attempted to cross the border from Afghanistan.",Osama bodyguard to be freed from Gitmo | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/osama-bodyguard-to-be-freed-from-gitmo/

The United States is weighing targeted sanctions against South Sudan due to failure of leaders in the worldís youngest nation to take steps to end a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of civil war, sources briefed on US discussions told Reuters. ìItís a tool that has been discussed,î a source told Reuters about the possibility of US sanctions against those blocking peace efforts or fuelling violence in South Sudan. Another source confirmed the remarks. No decisions have been made yet, the sources added. Targeted sanctions focus on specific individuals, entities or sectors of country. The US government was unlikely to consider steps intended to economically harm impoverished South Sudan but would likely focus on any measures on those individuals or groups it sees as blocking efforts at brokering peace or committing atrocities. Traditionally, US sanctions against individuals or groups involve a ban on travel to the United States and freezing of their assets in US banks. Three weeks of fighting, often along ethnic lines, is ringing alarm bells in Washington over the prospect that the conflict could spiral into full-blown civil war, spawning atrocities or making South Sudan the worldís next failed state. The fact that Washington is thinking of threatening US sanctions against a country it helped create and supports with large amounts of aid shows how frustrated President Barack Obamaís administration has become with President Salva Kiir and a rebel faction led by former Vice President Riek Machar.

The trio filed the complaint Wednesday with the Internal Affairs Office (IAO), an independent unit of the Singapore Police Force that investigates disciplinary offences or crimes committed by officers during the course of their work. They include IT product manager Arun Kaliamurthy, 28, who was visiting Singapore as a tourist when he was implicated in the December 8 riot, and Rajendran Mohan, 25, and Ravi Arun Vengatesh, 24, who were working here but were alleged to have rioted, The Straits Times reported Thursday. They alleged they were physically assaulted and subjected to insults and threats to get them to admit to their roles in the riot that left 39 police and civil defence staff injured and 25 vehicles, including 16 police cars, damaged. Singapore previously witnessed violence of such scale during race riots in 1969. The three are out on bail. They were arrested from separate places after the riot and are part of 25 Indians facing charges for rioting in Singaporeís Little India, a precinct of Indian-origin businesses, eateries and pubs where South Asians working in Singapore spend their day off. Their lawyer M Ravi urged a ìfair and justî probe by the IAO into the allegations. The IAO took statements from the trio after they raised the allegations in court last month. Mohan had alleged that he was coerced to admit involvement in the riot even if innocent, to accept blame ìfor the other Tamils who did indeed participate.î He was told if he did not confess, he would be ìsent home in a body bagî, the report quoted Mohan as saying.","3 Indians allege police abuse, file complaint | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/3-indians-allege-police-abuse-file-complaint/

This Friday, Islamist supporters of Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood organization added a call to boycott of the January 14-15 referendum on changes to the constitution drafted under the ousted president. Egyptís military-backed interim government is seeking a comfortable ìyesî majority vote and a strong turnout that would enshrine their legitimacy ahead of planned presidential and parliamentary elections. In clashes Friday in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, a street vendor was shot and killed as hundreds of Morsi supporters marched, Maj. Gen. Nasser el-Abd said. It wasnít clear who shot the vendor. Protesters set fire to tires and trash cans, threw gasoline bombs, used flares and threw rocks at the security forces, who fired tear gas and chased them in side streets, according to a police statement. Two people were injured by bird shot, while protesters set a car ablaze and partially burnt a police vehicle, police said. In Suez, gunfire killed two people and injured seven as clashes raged between Islamists and security forces, a health official said.

Unidentified assailants opened fire on the German ambassadorís residence in Athens with a Kalashnikov assault rifle early on Monday in an attack seen as an attempt to sour relations between debt-laden Greece and its biggest creditor nation. At least 60 shots were fired in the air and four hit the metal gate of the walled,high-security residence which lies on a busy street of a northern suburb,police said. No one was hurt. Anti-German sentiment has grown during Greeceís prolonged economic crisis and many of those struggling with record unemployment and falling living standards blame Germanyís insistence on fiscal rigour for their economic woes. Germany is the biggest single contributing nation to Greeceís 240-billion-euro bailouts which have kept the country afloat since 2010 and saved it from bankruptcy. No one has claimed responsibility for the 3.40 a.m. (0140 GMT) attack which police believe was carried out by members of leftist guerrilla groups. A police official,who spoke on condition of anonymity,said at least two assailants on foot were involved. ìWhoever is responsible for this act: You will not succeed in disrupting the close and friendly relations of our two countries,î said German Ambassador Wolfgang Dold,who was at home at the time of the incident. The residence was the target of an attack once before in 1999,when members of the now dismantled extremist group November 17 fired a rocket-propelled grenade that hit its roof.

His unit ó which had seven of 17 men wounded by shrapnel or bullets in the first days of the invasion seized control of the government centre early in the campaign. So when Sunni insurgents, some with allegiances to al-Qaeda, retook the city this month and raised their black insurgent flag over buildings where he and his men had fought, he was disbelieving and appalled. ìI texted a couple of friends,î said Banotai, now a firefighter and registered nurse in Pennsylvania. ìEveryone was in disbelief.î ìI donít think anyone had the grand illusion that Fallujah or Ramadi was going to turn into Disneyland, but none of us thought it was going to fall back to a jihadist insurgency,î he said. ìIt made me sick to my stomach to have that thrown in our face, everything we fought for so blatantly taken away.î The bloody mission to wrest Fallujah from insurgents in November 2004 meant more to the Marines than almost any other battle in the 12 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many consider it the corpsí biggest and most iconic fight since Vietnam, with nearly 100 Marines and soldiers killed in action and hundreds wounded. For many veterans of that battle ó most now working in jobs long removed from combat ó watching insurgents running roughshod through the streets they once fought to secure, often in brutal close-quarters combat, has shaken their faith in what their mission achieved.

Hours after former home secretary R K Singh levelled a series of charges against Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said Singh had lobbied with the UPA for a post-retirement job, and had sent ìfeelersî to him. R K Singh, who retired in June 2013, joined the BJP last month, saying he shared the partyís ìhardline orientation on national security issuesî. His accusations against Shinde, made over Monday and Tuesday, included the charge that the minister had misled the country about the US helping to bring back Dawood Ibrahim, and that his office had interfered in transfers and postings of Delhi Police officers. On Tuesday evening, Digvijaya Singh told The Indian Express: ìHe (R K Singh) didnít meet me, but there were feelers coming through that he is angling for some post-retirement post in Delhi.î Digvijaya Singh did not say which post R K Singh was allegedly eyeing, but other sources in the Congress claimed he had wanted to be Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India. Digvijaya Singh said these days, ìbureaucrats after retiring suddenly develop political ambitionsî. A cooling-off period for them ìcould be consideredî, he said. Ironically, it was Shinde who had backed the then home secretary in the face of loud demands for his sacking in the aftermath of the December 16, 2012 Delhi bus gangrape. At a meeting of senior Congress ministers in Parliament, it was suggested that R K Singh be removed, but Shinde had let the officer, who was six months from retirement at the time, continue. The minister only registered a formal complaint with the cabinet secretary, asking him to pull up R K Singh. Singh was the only home secretary in recent years who was not considered for a post-retirement assignment by the government. All his predecessors ó G K Pillai, Madhukar Gupta, V K Duggal ó still continue to be offered jobs. Shinde had announced the name of Singhís successor ó Anil Goswami ó two months in advance. At the fag end of his tenure, Singh had attempted to mend fences with the home minister, naming terror accused with alleged links to the RSS. This came after Shinde, speaking at the Jaipur plenary of the Congress, accused the BJP and RSS of running terror camps. Singh, a Bihar cadre IAS officer, shot to fame when, as district magistrate, he arrested L K Advani in Samastipur during the 1990 Rath Yatra. A couple of years earlier, Singh had received accolades for overthrowing the mafia as managing director of the Bihar State Cooperative Marketing Union (Biscomaun). Singh worked at the union home ministry during the NDA government from 1999-2004. He served in Bihar for the next five years, before being picked by Defence Minister A K Antony to head the department of defence production in 2009. He became union home secretary after G K Pillai retired in 2011. After Shinde took over as home minister in August 2012, Singh sometimes took decisions without consulting him. Earlier that year, Singh had triggered a controversy after reportedly telling state bureaucrats called to discuss the NCTC not to be ìstenographersî of politicians. On Tuesday, Digvijaya Singh tweeted, ìShocked at the Opportunistic behaviour of RK Singh ex HS [home secretary]. Why did he not bring this [Shindeís alleged interference in the work of the Delhi Police] to the notice of Cabinet Secretary or the PM? ìIs it not a fact that he tried to get a post retirement position from UPA? Is it not a fact that he approached Nitish (Kumar) for a position? ìHis charges are extremely serious and and if he kept quiet then he is guilty also of not fulfilling his assigned responsibility. Shocking!î Shinde, Digvijaya tweeted, was a politician who had held several responsible positions, and ìsuch false charges by an ex HS are condemnableî.

The volume and sensitive nature of information generated and shared widely during the course of a deal makes the corporate finance community particularly vulnerable to cyber crime, according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales' (ICAEW) Cyber-Security in Corporate Finance report. The report, published on Thursday, cites several examples to highlight the risks related to deals, including the case of one midcap UK company which saw data related to a new technology stolen after its computer network was infiltrated. The report contains tips to help guard against threats from organised crime networks, nation states, so-called ""hacktivists"" and employees looking to profit from advance notice of a deal, to sell on information or data, or to sabotage deals entirely. Devised by its ""Taskforce"" of 12 major professional organisations, including the Cabinet Office and the London Stock Exchange, and backed by the government's 860 million pound ($1.4 billion) National Cyber Security Programme , the guidance spans all phases of a deal from initial information gathering to completion. Among its recommendations, the Taskforce suggests limiting the number of people ""brought inside"" early deal talks, appointing an IT team to monitor activity around shared information, carrying out due diligence on the cyber security systems of all parties involved in a transaction and creating incident response plans. ""It's very important to guard against over-confidence within circles of trust and to question whether all information should be shared with all parties during a corporate finance transaction,"" said ICAEW Chief Executive Michael Izza.

He said he would take up whatever work his party gives him. Singh said the Congress was not shy of projecting Rahul as the PM candidate. ìDonít see this as a sign of weakness. We have the courage to face any adversity. For whatever little I have known of Rahul Gandhi, he has the courage to face any adversity. Let us not also not forget the fact that Indira Gandhi fought aggressively against all odds even in the worst scenario. Sonia Gandhi too faced adversities and came out of it. What was the situation of the Congress when she took over. It was in dumps and we have recovered,î he said. While Rahul ó in his interview to Dainik Bhaskar signaled willingness to take up the PMís post ó he did not indicate if he would be the PM candidate, saying his party has never been specific on this. He made it clear that his sister Priyanka Vadra would not take up any electoral role. ìPriyanka is my sister and friend. Besides, she is an active member of the Congress, because of which she is helping to strengthen me and the organisation. I do not think she will have any electoral role,î he said. On whether he would take up the PMís post, he said, ìWe are a democratic organisation. We believe in democracy. The people of the country will decide through the elected representatives who will be the PM. It is imperative in the national interest that the Congress comes to power. And for that, whatever responsibility the organisation has given me and will give in the future, I will carry that out with full dedication.î On his earlier remarks that ìpower is poisonî, which were being interpreted as his reluctance on the PM post, he said, ìPower is poison does not mean I am not keen to take up responsibility. There is no word called reluctance in my life. Power is poison is an observation about the dangers that come with power and how to deal with it.î Asked why the party was not declared its PM candidate, he said, ìThe Congress has never been specific on this.

Companys performance. During the financial year 2012-13, the global economic environment was on a slow growth path. There were signs of faster growth in certain geographies, primarily in the emerging markets. The prevailing uncertainties were challenging, which called for much higher level of efficiency and preparedness for participants in the market. In the financial year 2012-13, on consolidated basis, the Company has achieved well-rounded growth with steady profitability. The Company had excellent growth across markets - United Kingdom (44%), Latin America (40%), North America (27%), Europe (21%), Asia Pacific (27%), Middle East Africa (28%) and India (16%). All the industry segments have registered double digit growth. For the first time, the Company crossed USD 3 billion revenue in a quarter during Q4 of the financial year 2012-13. On consolidated basis, revenue from operations for the financial year 2012-13 at Rs. 62,989.48 crores was higher by 28.8% over last year (Rs. 48,893.83 crores in 2011-12).

The Company has made acquisitions over the past few years either directly or through its subsidiaries. During the year 2012-13, the Company acquired Computational Research Laboratories Limited (CRL). CRL was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons Limited. The acquisition of CRL, a pioneering start-up company in the area of high performance computing solutions in India, enabled the Company to extend its suite of solutions and offer integrated high performance computing applications and Cloud services to its large base of customers. RFL and CRL, both wholly owned subsidiaries engaged in similar business as that of the Company, have amalgamated with the Company with effect from the Appointed Date, i.e., April 1, 2012 and October 1, 2012 respectively, in terms of the scheme of amalgamation sanctioned by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay by its Order dated March 22, 2013. The amalgamation would lead to efficient utilisation of resources and enhanced growth of the consolidated entity. On October 19, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company, e-Serve and TEIL have approved a composite scheme of arrangement (""Scheme"") between the Company, e-Serve, TEIL and their respective shareholders under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 (""Act""), proposing amalgamation of e-Serve with the Company and demerger of SEZ undertaking of TEIL into the Company. e-Serve and TEIL are engaged in the business of providing information technology enabled services (ITES) and business process outsourcing services (BPO) for its customers primarily in the banking, financial services and insurance domain. e-Serves operations include delivering core business process services, analytics/ insights and support services for both data and voice processes. The Scheme will lead to operational synergy. In the year 2008-09, the Company had acquired Citigroup Inc.s (Citi) 96.26% interest in e-Serve (then known as Citigroup Global Services Limited), the India-based captive BPO of Citi. TEIL is a wholly owned subsidiary of e-Serve. The Appointed Date proposed for the Scheme is April 1, 2013. Pursuant to an Order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, a meeting of the equity shareholders of the Company has been scheduled on Friday, May 31, 2013, for the purpose of seeking approval of the shareholders. 7.

Individual and organisational capability building remained one of the strategic focus areas. A total of 12,789 person years of effort were invested in enhancing the proficiency levels of the employees and in developing a steady stream of business leaders ready to take on the challenges as per growing requirements of the organisation. The workforce management strategy was executed optimally to deliver a sustained utilisation rate throughout the year helping business grow while maintaining employee costs at the desired level. The robust and mature talent management and talent engagement processes of the Company helped create an environment where performance is rewarded, opportunities are provided for career growth and people are encouraged to realise their potential. Focused initiatives towards health and safety and other non-work related employee engagement programmes helped develop the personality and confidence level of the employees enhancing their motivation and engagement with the organisation. The relentless drive to create ""One TCS Culture"" across the organisation helped the Company integrate its diverse global talent base into a cohesive high performing unit. These initiatives have delivered the desired results as is evident from the low attrition rate of 10.6% achieved during this year, a benchmark in the industry. 8. Quality initiatives.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: After the vitriolic attack on it by Congress, Delhi's ruling AAP faced more criticism today with BJP asserting the country is being presented with ""gimmickry"" and the road to ""anarchy"" and NCP saying the party was yet to spell out its ideology. BJP also used the accusations levelled by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Vinod Kumar Binny to attack Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, charging it with ""compromising"" with corruption and ""duping"" the people of Delhi. Targeting senior AAP leaders, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said there is an in-built danger in establishing a political party and then going out to search its members and its ideology and noted that a group of ""disparate, self-opinionated persons"" has flocked to the new outfit. ""India was promised alternative politics. I had personally hoped that alternative politics promised by AAP would lead to larger footprints on the Indian society. Conventional political parties and politicians would realize the importance of probity and accountability. Instead, the country is being presented with gimmickry and the road to anarchy,"" Jaitley said in an article. He also said the alternative politics promised by the new outfit has faltered. He cautioned the political parties that this failure should not be confused by the message of setting higher standards of probity and accountability. ""My fear is that the failure of this experiment should not be confused by other parties as a failure of the good message of higher standards of probity and accountability."" NCP asked AAP to explain its stand on secularism and reservation for backward classes and minorities. The one-year-old party is yet to give a clear view on where it stands on the principles of secularism and it should spell out its ideology, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik told a press conference in Mumbai. When the late HRD minister Arjun Singh introduced reservations for OBCs in IIMs and IITs, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia's youth for equality forum opposed the move, he said. ""The party should clarify if it is opposed to reservations,"" Malik said.

Taking a dig at 'Janta Darbar' of Delhi Chief Minister, Badal said that Darbars were being held by the Monarchs whereas the representatives of the people hold 'Sangat Darshans', like one done by him since decades. (PTI) Summary. Addressing a gathering during Maghi festival, Badal said tactics being adopted by both these parties were detrimental to people. Terming the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as the ìtwo sides of a coinî,Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal Tuesday asked the people to beware of the ìcheap political gimmickryî of both the parties. Addressing a gathering during the Maghi festival, Badal said that the tactics being adopted by both these parties were detrimental to the people. He said that both these parties resort to such cheap tactics just only to befool the voters as all their promises prove mere lip service later on. Badal said that since decades the Congress leaders have befooled the public by raising hollow slogans and now AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind† Kejriwal was walking on the footsteps of the Congress. ìKejriwal has become the Chief Minister of Delhi by chance due to which he was utterly confused about what to do,î Badal said, adding that Kejriwal would prove to be a flop show after next two-three months. Taking a dig at ëJanta Darbarí of Delhi Chief Minister, Badal said that Darbars were being held by the Monarchs whereas the representatives of the people hold ëSangat Darshansí, like one done by him since decades. Exhorting the people to rout the Congress in the coming general elections, he said that the need of the hour was to wage a ìsecond war of freedomî to oust this government, which has made the life of every person miserable. The Chief Minister said that due to the misrule of the UPA government the nation was not safe both internally and externally due to which its sovereignty was in peril. Badal alleged that the anti-farmerís stance of the UPA government has broken the backbone of the farmers of the state due to which they were reeling under a whopping debt of Rs 32,000 crore. While, SAD-BJP government in Punjab had given a major relief to farmers by giving free power worth Rs 6000 crore, he added. Badal also listed a number of ìpro-people welfare schemesî initiated by his government.Equating the current anger among the public to ìJanta Waveî in 1977, he said that even the Congress stalwarts would find it difficult to save their seats in this anti-Congress wave. Badal said that the BJP led NDA government was all set to form the next government at the centre as the people of the country were eagerly waiting for making† Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of the country. Badal said that there was hardly any match between Gujarat Chief Minister and Congress Vice President. Narendra Modi was a respected public leader with proven skills as an administrator, while Rahul Gandhi was a novice with no experience of public life, Badal stressed. He said that the young Nehru-Gandhi scion was like an inexperienced driver who was bound to topple the bus during the journey.† ìThe countrymen should not take the risk of handing the reigns of country in such immature handsî added Badal. Assailing the Punjab Congress President Partap Singh Bajwa, the Chief Minister said that by opposing the central grants, Bajwa has proved that he was inimical to the stateís interests. Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal also came down heavily on Bajwa by terming him the ìbiggest smugglerî involved in a number of frauds besides smuggling of narcotics and sex scandal. He alleged that Bajwa has been shielding the smugglers and drug peddlers in the state. Bajwaís close association with the terrorist outfits has also been exposed by former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. During last one-and-a-half years, 25000 drug peddlers have been nabbed in Punjab and this campaign would be continued, he added. He assured that once NDA comes into power, the water logging problem in the Malwa belt of the state would be a national mission and it would be completely eradicated on priority besides. Complementing the 85 year old ìdiligent and determinedî Badal, the SAD President said that AAP got tired of holding Public Darbars in just one day while the Chief Minister at this age worked for 20 hours a day.","Beware of cheap political gimmickry, Congress, AAP two sides of the same coin: Parkash Singh Badal | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/beware-of-cheap-political-gimmickry-congress-aap-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-parkash-singh-badal/

648,"Related. For how long can a national leader eyeing the top post remain ambiguous about his plans or afford not to react to blistering attacks from the opposition? Not long, for Congress scion Rahul Gandhi finally seems to be making it clear that he is willing to take on the responsibility that comes with leading the ruling party in what it seems will be an uphill climb for it in the coming elections. Pushed to a corner, Rahul seems to have been forced to come out of his silence and give an interview, this time to the Hindi media. That emotional coronation of Rahul at the AICC session in Jaipur had rejuvenated party leaders and workers, thus injecting a sense of energy among the cadre. But since then the party heading the UPA II government has been losing its sheen, and most importantly, its face amid recurring allegations of corruption and policy paralysis. Despite what seemed like a brilliant move to anoint him as the party number two, Rahulís sudden media appearances remained sporadic at best. Even when he chose to speak up, he didnít bother to take the battle to the opposition camp. The Lok Sabha election of 2014 will be unlike past polls. For a major chunk of voters are the youth, who want their leaders to interact, to talk, to express and to understand their aspirations. BJP with Narendra Modi as the leader is riding the airwaves, convincing the voter that he is the man who means business. Modiís track record ñ though debatable ñ is a public knowledge. But Rahul, who most probably will be the PM if Congress comes to power, has nothing to show that a voter can rely on, except his surname. Sensing that he was running out of time to open up about his plans for the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi finally made it clear that he is no more reluctant to take any responsibility. Though it has come a little late, but it will certainly help the Congress shed its leadership ambivalence. Now that the elections are months away with battlelines already drawn, the Congress vice-presidentís clear stand on his role will only add to the excitement among the voters. And most of all, will Rahul Gandhi continue speaking to the voter?",Quick Edit: Rahul realises that the power of silence does not lead to power | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/quick-edit-rahul-realises-that-the-power-of-silence-does-not-lead-to-power/

Said to be hesitant to take up the responsibility even as the chorus to declare him the prime ministerial candidate grows within the party, Rahul has said he has never been reluctant in life, asserting that he would take up whatever work is given to him by the party. In an interview to Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar just three days ahead of the AICC session, Rahul also made it clear that his sister Priyanka Vadra would not take up any electoral role. ìPriyanka is my sister and friend. Besides, she is an active member of the Congress, because of which she is helping to strengthen me and the organisation. I do not think she will have any electoral role,î he said. While he signalled his willingness to take up the PMís post ó Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has already announced that he will not seek a third term even if the UPA returns to power ó Rahul did not indicate whether he would be the Congressís prime ministerial candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Significantly, he said the Congress has never been specific on this. To a specific question on whether he would take up the Prime Ministerís post, he said, ìWe are a democratic organisation. We believe in democracy. The people of the country will decide through the elected representatives who will the Prime Minister of this country. It is imperative in the national interest that the Congress comes to power. And for that, whatever responsibility the organisation has given me and will give in the future, I will carry that out with full dedication,î he said.

651,"7 essential insurance covers for your enterprise. Cover for Thefts. Burglary covers are of three kinds. First is a full-value insurance where the policy covers the full value of the property and therefore is liable to reimburse the entire damage/loss, except for wherever sub-limits apply. The second type is called a 'first loss' policy where you get only partial insurance of your property. That is, in event of a theft, you agree to accept an amount less than the full value of the stolen items. Then there is a third type -- a stock declaration policy, where the sum insured is fixed at the beginning of the policy by anticipation the value of stocks your office will have at any given point of time. These policies are suitable where large inventory is involved and where the stock keeps fluctuating during the year. For small businesses, it is best to go with the first option. If you want to pay a lesser premium, even the 'first loss' policy is not a bad option. Whichever plan you pick, be wary of the exclusions list and read the fine print carefully. Burglary insurance protects you from losses due to theft when there is an actual forced break-in or even an attempted break-in. However, it does not protect you in case keys are used to enter your premise. Moreover, the insurer will repudiate your claim if your family or the business staff is involved. Any incident of loss when the office premise has been left uninhabited for 7 or more consecutive days is non-claimable as well. The exclusions list also includes loss of jewelry, title deeds, business books (unless specifically insured), plate glass, theft by family or employees and items covered under a parallel policy, say, fire insurance.",Cover for Thefts - 7 essential insurance covers for your enterprise | The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/slideshows/investments-markets/7-essential-insurance-covers-for-your-enterprise/cover-for-thefts/slideshow/28882021.cms

A bench headed by Justice P V Hardas last week set aside life imprisonment imposed on Sanjay Ahire by a lower court on the ground the victim had given two contradictory dying declarations. The 35-year-old doctor,a resident of Deola taluka of the North Maharashtra district,was convicted in 2009 for setting his wife Pratiksha afire,resulting in her death,as he suspected her character. However,she gave two dying declarations to police. In the first one,the deceased said she caught fire on account of sudden flaring of the stove. In the other,recorded at the instance of the victimís father,she implicated her husband,saying he had set her ablaze. The High Court noted there were two dying declarations given by Pratiksha,and both of them were contradictory. The Bench said ìacceptance of any one dying declaration would necessarily falsify the other. In the light of the contradictory dying declarations,in our opinion,the appellant would be entitled to be given the benefit of doubt.î ìIt would not be open for the court to pick and choose one dying declaration for basing a conviction of the accused,î said the Judges. ìThere is nothing on record to even remotely indicate that the dying declaration was not the truthful narration of Pratiksha or that Pratiksha was not in a fit condition to give her statement. Therefore,in our opinion,the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of doubt,î they said. ìThe possibility that the subsequent dying declaration was a result of tutoring of Pratiksha by her relatives cannot be ruled out. That background,therefore,impels us to allow the appeal and give benefit of doubt to the accused.î On October 14,2009,Malegaon Sessions Court had convicted the doctor on charges of murdering his wife and subjecting her to domestic violence.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday questioned the Centre over the functioning of the screening committee for allocation of coal blocks in which certain private companies were allegedly preferred despite not figuring in the recommendations by competent authorities. The court was also critical of the Centre for its ìlaxityî in deallocating coal blocks from entities which held them for long without meeting necessary clearances even as Attorney General GE Vahanvati informed it that the process of deallocation has been put in motion. The apex court raised questions on the working of the screening committee for considering some of private companies which were not in the list of recommendations of Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and ministry of power. A three-judge bench headed by Justice RM Lodha wanted to know from the Attorney General about the guidelines and parameters followed by the screening committee in coal block allocations, saying the minutes of meetings did not reflect these factors. The bench said it was necessary for it to know the norms for allocation as there were no affidavits of the members of screening committee who were involved in the decision-making process for allocation. ìThe allegation is that allocations were made arbitrarily and it smacks of favouritism,î the bench, also comprising Justices MB Lokur and Kurian Joseph, said while making it clear that ìdecision-making process can be explained only by those who were involved in the process and not by an outsiderî. ìWhat appears to be for sure is that the screening committee is not accepting the broad guidelines,î it observed while hearing the issue of allocation of coal blocks by screening committee in 2007-08 when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was holding charge of the coal ministry.

Iran has agreed to limit uranium enrichment and to open its nuclear program to daily inspection by international experts starting Jan. 20, setting the clock running on a six-month deadline for a final nuclear agreement, officials said. In exchange, the Islamic Republic will get a relaxation of the financial sanctions that have been crippling its economy. The announcement that Iran and six world powers had agreed on the plan for implementing an interim agreement came first from Iranian officials and was later confirmed elsewhere. Some U.S. lawmakers have been leery of the agreement, calling for tougher sanctions against Iran, rather than any loosening of controls. Iranís official IRNA news agency on Sunday quoted Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi as saying the deal, which sets the terms of a landmark agreement reached in November, would take effect from Jan. 20. IRNA said Iran will grant the United Nationsí watchdog ó the International Atomic Energy Agency ó access to its nuclear facilities and its centrifuge production lines to confirm it is complying with terms of the deal. Araghchi later told state television that some $4.2 billion in seized oil revenue would be released under the deal. Senior officials in President Barack Obamaís administration put the total relief figure at $7 billion. In a statement, Obama welcomed the deal, saying it ìwill advance our goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.î ìI have no illusions about how hard it will be to achieve this objective, but for the sake of our national security and the peace and security of the world, now is the time to give diplomacy a chance to succeed,î Obama said. Under the November agreement, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment to 5 percent ó the grade commonly used to power reactors. The deal also commits Iran to stop producing 20 percent enriched uranium ó which is only a technical step away from weapons-grade material ó and to neutralize its 20 percent stockpile over the six months. In exchange, economic sanctions Iran faces would be eased for six months. During that time, the so-called P5+1 world powers ó Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States ó would continue negotiations with Iran on a permanent deal. The West fears Iranís nuclear program could allow it to build a nuclear bomb. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, such as medical research and power generation. Iranís semi-official ISNA news agency reported Sunday that under the terms of the deal, Iran will guarantee that it wonít try to attain nuclear arms ìunder any circumstance.î However, Araghchi stressed Iran could resume production of 20 percent uranium in ìone dayî if it chose. The senior U.S. officials said U.N. inspectors would have daily access to Iranian nuclear sites and would make monthly reports. Iran will dilute half of its nuclear material during the first three months of the agreement, the officials said, and all of it by the end of the agreement. In exchange, Iran would have access to parts for its civilian aviation and automotive industries. Iran also would be allowed to import and export gold, as well as export petrochemicals, the officials said. The deal also gives Iran access to international humanitarian and medical supplies, though Iran still could not use U.S. banks and the majority of sanctions would remain in place, they said. The senior U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the specific terms of the agreement were not released publicly. European Union negotiator Catherine Ashton praised the deal in a statement, saying ìthe foundations for a coherent, robust and smooth implementation Ö have been laid.î German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called the deal ìa decisive step forward which we can build on.î U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also welcomed the deal in a statement, saying further negotiations ìrepresent the best chance we have to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully, and durably.î But Kerry cautioned that despite a fledgling detente with Iran, the nuclear negotiations have all but exhausted both sidesí time, keeping them from being able to work on other shared global interests, including the civil war in Syria. ìWe have been so focused and so intent on the nuclear file that we really have not dug into (Syria) in any appreciably substantive way,î Kerry told reporters in Paris, where he was meeting with other Western foreign ministers and the head of the main moderate opposition group, which is seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, ahead of peace talks scheduled in just over a week in Switzerland. Iran is the main backer of Assadís regime. Suspicions remain high in both Tehran and Washington after decades of hostility dating back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran that ousted the U.S.-backed shah dynasty. Iranís new reformist president, Hassan Rouhani, has reached out to the West, but must depend on support from Iranís top decision-maker, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for his initiatives amid criticism from hard-line factions. Obama must fend off efforts by U.S. lawmakers, including many of his fellow Democrats, who want to pass new sanctions legislation. The measure proposes to blacklist several Iranian industrial sectors and ban banks and companies around the world from the U.S. market if they help Iran export any more oil. The provisions would only take effect if Tehran violates the interim nuclear deal or lets it expire without a follow-up accord.

A life-sized replica of the Titanic will become the centrepiece of a landlocked theme park in China, featuring a museum and a shipwreck simulation to give visitors a harrowing sense of the 1912 disaster. The Chinese version of ìthe unsinkable shipî, with a price tag of 1 billion yuan ($165 million) and an expected opening date in 2016, will be built at least 1,500 km (930 miles) from the nearest ocean in the central province of Sichuan. Su Shaojun, chief executive of the Seven Star Energy Investment Group that funded the project, said Asia needs its own Titanic museum. ìWe think itís worth spreading the spirit of the Titanic. The universal love and sense of responsibility shown during the Titanic shipwreck represent the spiritual richness of human civilisation,î he told a media conference on Sunday. The project aims to be more than a museum that replicates the original ship and the 1997 movie that became a global hit. The simulation will allow several hundred people at a time to feel what the shipwreck was like. ìWhen the ship hits the iceberg, it will shake, it will tumble,î Su said. ìWe will let people experience water coming in by using sound and light effects Ö They will think, ëThe water will drown me, I must escape with my lifeí.î The massive and luxurious Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage from the English port of Southampton to New York, taking more than 1,500 lives with it. The 1997 movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, is the second highest-grossing film on record after Avatar, bringing in nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. Bernard Hill, who played Captain Edward Smith in the movie and flew to Hong Kong to show his support for the Chinese replica, dismissed suggestions that building a theme park based on a tragedy was inappropriate. ìItís been approached in a very delicate and a very sensitive way and theyíre very aware of the extent of the disaster in 1912,î he said. ìI donít think it will belittle that disaster.î Hill said his flight and hotel were paid for but he did not get any extra money for taking part in the media conference.

The 62-year-old man collapsed and died on the roof of his home in suburban Hovea on Perthís eastern fringe on Sunday. He was believed to be hosing water onto his roof to protect it against embers, state fire service spokesman Allen Gale said Monday. The house was not damaged, Gale said. Erractic winds whipped up 20-meter (65-foot) flames. The fire destroyed 46 houses and badly damaged another home in a picturesque region known as the Perth Hills, where homes are scattered through eucalyptus and jarrah forests, Gale said. Four people remained unaccounted for at Parkerville, the village where the fire started and four homes were burnt down, Fire Commissioner Wayne Gregson said. ìIt could well be that some individuals have been victims of the fire,î Gregson said. The wildfire risk has been heightened by heat wave conditions on the west coast. Perthís temperature reached 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday, the cityís hottest day in six years. About 275 firefighters on Monday continued to fight the blaze which has burnt through about 350 hectares (865 acres) of woodlands and has been contained since Sunday night. Firefightersí battle to keep the fire within containment lines was helped by cooler conditions. Temperatures in the hills region peaked at 41 degrees Celsius ( 106 F) on Sunday, but a sea breeze pushed the forecast maximum down to less than 30 degrees Celsius (86 F) on Monday. Gregson said there was nothing his team of 385 firefighters could have done to save more houses. ìWhen you have a fire front of the magnitude they had yesterday, it was unassailable,î Gregson said.","Australian wildfire destroys 46 houses, one man dies | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/australian-wildfire-destroys-46-houses-one-man-dies/

Anti-government protesters on Monday begun blocking key intersections across the congested Thai capital in their bid to ìshutdownî the city and force embattled Premier Yingluck Shinawatra to step down. One protester was shot and injured while he was guarding a barrier at the Chaeng Wattana rally site here late on Sunday night by an unidentified gunman on a motorcycle, police said. The opposition Democrat party, which has not won polls in two decades, has been venting its ire against the Yingluck government for two months now holding protest marches here. The protesters want Yingluck and her brother former premier Thaksin Shinawatra out of Thai politics. Thaksin was overthrown in a coup in 2006 and is in self-exile in Dubai. Yingluck has called for snap polls on February 2 following weeks of opposition protests. But the opposition has said it will boycott the polls. Today is their first massive protest aimed at shutting down the city. The Democrats have said they will boycott the elections. Ruling Pheu Thai Party leader and caretaker Interior Minister Charupong Ruangsuwan said the government was ready to consider the Election Commission (EC) proposal that the polls be postponed, but said the agency should state why it believed the election would go smoothly if it was held on May 4. ìHas the EC gone to soothsayers, such as ET?î Charupong said in a reference to E Thi, Myanmarís most famous fortune-teller. Charupong said that legally, the election could not be postponed beyond February 6, as the election law stated it must be held within 60 days of a House dissolution. The only exceptions are in cases of disasters or riots, and only in the affected areas, not nationwide. ìIf we postpone because of fears that there would be violence, it would set a bad precedent for future elections,î he said. Pheu Thai spokesman Prompong Nopparit yesterday submitted a letter to the EC to show the partyís stance that the poll must be held on February 2, since a budget of over 3.8 billion baht has been allocated for the agency to do this. The protesters want an appointed ìpeopleís councilî to run the country before general elections are held. Thaksin, a billionaire telecoms tycoon-turned-politician, lives abroad to avoid a jail term for corruption, and has a large electoral support base in northern and north eastern Thailand. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former Democrat Party MP, expects a large turnout for the latest demonstration. Several schools and local universities are closed.

Two separate car bomb explosions targeted commuters in Baghdad on Sunday morning, killing at least 13 civilians, officials said, amid an ongoing standoff between Iraqi forces and al-Qaeda-linked militants west of the Iraqi capital. The blasts came a day after a senior American official wrapped up a three-day visit to Iraq to meet with top political leaders to discuss the security crisis in the vast Sunni-dominated western province of Anbar. The deadliest blast occurred at a crowded bus station in central Baghdad when an explosives-laden car exploded outside the station in the Allawi area, killing at least nine people and wounding 16, a police officer said. Thousands of people use the bus station every day or pass through the area. Last Thursday, a suicide bomber blew himself up among a group of security force recruits nearby, killing nearly two dozen. Another parked car bomb targeted a gathering of buses and taxis in Baghdadís northern Hurriyah neighbourhood, killing four civilians and wounding 12 others, the same police officer said. Two medical officials confirmed the causality figures, which included 16 wounded. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to release information. The attacks come as Iraqi security forces and allied Sunni tribal militias have been battling al-Qaeda-linked militants in Anbar to recapture strategic territory overrun by militants from the local al-Qaeda franchise, known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Iraqi forces have yet to militarily try to reassert control over Fallujah, which remains in the hands of the militants and tribal gunmen opposed to the central government. Militants and tribal fighters also control part of the provincial capital, Ramadi. Sporadic clashes there and in surrounding areas continue to take place. Thousands of families have left the area, fearing a government offensive. Clashes between militants and security forces have left at least 60 people dead since violence erupted after the December 28 arrest of a Sunni lawmaker sought on terrorism charges and the dismantling of an anti-government Sunni protest camp in Ramadi. The extremist militants, emboldened by fellow fightersí gains in the civil war in neighbouring Syria, have tried to position themselves as the champions of Iraqi Sunnis angry at the Shiite-led government over what they see as efforts to marginalise them.",2 car bombings kill 13 civilians in Iraq | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/middle-east-and-africa/2-car-bombings-kill-13-civilians-in-iraq/

671,"US: First marijuana retailers prepare for New Yearís opening in†Colorado. Summary. Related. Proprietors of the first marijuana retailers licensed to sell pot for recreational use in Colorado were busy rolling joints and stocking up their leafy merchandise ahead of a grand opening on Wednesday that marks a new chapter in Americaís drug culture. Thirteen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers who are interested in nothing more than its mind- and mood-altering properties were slated to begin welcoming customers as early as 8 a.m. local time. When they do,they will be launching an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross $578 million in annual revenues,including $67 million in tax receipts for the state. Possession,cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters. But starting New Yearís Day,cannabis will be legally produced,sold to the general public and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales ñ but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of Colorado. Due to the novelty factor,operators of the first group of retailers slated to open their doors in the Denver area and a handful of other locations were anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed. Inside a warehouse tucked away in the blue-collar Denver suburb of Northglenn,a trio of workers were feverishly rolling hundreds of marijuana cigarettes by hand in preparation for the onslaught. ìWe expect to have 2,000 joints ready to go by the time we open,î said Robin Hackett,51,co-owner of Botana Care,who said she expects between 800 to 1,000 customers to patronize her store the first day. The store has hired a private security firm to help with traffic and parking issues that might arise. Hackett said she has 50 lbs (23 kg) of product on hand,and to avoid a supply shortage the shop will limit purchases to quarter-ounces on Wednesday,including joints,raw buds or cannabis-infused edibles such as pastries or candies. A quarter-ounce sampler packet with seven strains of weed labeled with names such as ìKing Tut Kushî and ìGypsy Girlî ñ each said to produce a different kind of high ñ will retail for $85 to $90,including tax,Hackett said. Cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law,though the Obama administration has said it will give individual states leeway to carry out their own recreational-use statutes. Nearly 20 states,including Colorado and Washington,had already put themselves at odds with the U.S. government by approving marijuana for medical purposes. Opponents warned that legalizing recreational use could help create an industry intent on attracting underage users and getting more people dependent on the drug. Comparing the nascent pot market to the alcohol industry,former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy,co-founder of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana,said his group aims to curtail marijuana advertising and to help push local bans on the drug while the industry is still modest in stature. ìThis is a battle that if we catch it early enough we can prevent some of the most egregious adverse impacts that have happened as a result of the commercialized market that promotes alcohol use to young people,î he said. Under Colorado law,however,state residents can buy as much as an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana at a time,while out-of-state visitors are restricted to quarter-ounce purchases. Restraint was certainly the message being propagated on New Yearís Eve by Colorado authorities,who posted signs at Denver International Airport and elsewhere around the capital warning that pot shops can only operate during approved hours,and that open,public consumption of marijuana remains illegal.",US: First marijuana retailers prepare for New Yearís opening in Colorado | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/us-first-marijuana-retailers-prepare-for-new-years-opening-in-colorado/

673,"Summary. Related. Scientists have reached farther back than ever into the ancestry of humans to recover and analyze DNA,using a bone found in Spain thatís estimated to be 400,000 years old. So far,the achievement has provided more questions than answers about our ancient forerunners. The feat surpasses the previous age record of about 100,000 years for genetic material recovered from members of the human evolutionary line. Older DNA has been mapped from animals. Experts said the work shows that new techniques for working with ancient DNA may lead to more discoveries about human origins. Results were presented online Wednesday in the journal Nature by Matthias Meyer and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,Germany,with co-authors in Spain and China. They retrieved the DNA from a thighbone found in a cave in northern Spain. It is among thousands of fossils from at least 28 individuals to be recovered from a chamber called the ìPit of the Bones.î The remains are typically classified as Homo heidelbergensis,but not everybody agrees. The age of the bones has been hard to determine. A rough estimate from analyzing the DNA is around 400,000 years,which supports what Meyer said is the current view of the anthropologists excavating the site. Todd Disotell,an anthropology professor at New York University,said geological techniques suggest the remains are older than 300,000 years but itís not clear by how much. By comparison,modern humans arose only about 200,000 years ago. The researchers mapped almost the complete collection of so-called mitochondrial DNA. While the DNA most people know about is found in the nucleus of a cell,mitochondrial DNA lies outside the nucleus. It is passed only from mother to child. Researchers used the DNA to construct possible evolutionary family trees that include the Spanish individuals and two groups that showed up much later: Neanderthals and an evolutionary cousin of Neanderthals called Denisovans. They assumed the DNA would show similarities to Neanderthal DNA,since the Spanish fossils have anatomical features reminiscent of Neanderthals. But surprisingly,the DNA instead showed a closer relationship to Denisovans,who lived in Siberia and apparently elsewhere in Asia,far from the Spanish cave. Scientists are uncertain of how to explain that,Meyer said. The picture should get clearer if scientists can recover the other kind of DNA,found in the nucleus,from the Spanish bones,he said. Nucleus DNA would give more comprehensive information about evolutionary relationships between species,perhaps telling a story much different from the mitochondrial DNA evidence,Meyer said. Nucleus DNA is harder to recover,but Meyer said heís optimistic that some small fraction might be retrievable. He also noted that the cave has acted as ìthe perfect fridgeî to preserve the DNA for eons,and said it will be hard to find comparable situations elsewhere. Experts in ancient DNA called the new paper exciting because it showed scientists can recover older DNA than many had thought outside the deep freeze of permafrost areas. Much of human evolution happened in warmer places. ìWe had been operating for a while under the assumption that the oldest DNA weíre going to get is about 100,000 years,î said Disotell. Now,îwe might take a shot at some older samples that we just never would have bothered with in the past.î In warm places like Africa,where DNA does not preserve well,even getting genetic material that is just tens of thousands of years old would be an advance,said David Reich of Harvard Medical School.","400,000-year-old DNA from human relative sets age record | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/400-000yearold-dna-from-human-relative-sets-age-record/

The US National Security Agency has employed more than a thousand IT specialists to hack into 50,000 computer systems worldwide and to install malicious software designed to steal sensitive information,a media report has said. In addition to its massive monitoring and collection of telephone and Internet data,the US intelligence agency has been extensively infiltrating computer systems around the world and planted malware,Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported on Saturday. The Amsterdam daily said top secret NSA documents made available by whistle-blower Edward Snowden have revealed that the agency was able to infiltrate over 50,000 computer networks and to install the malware with the help of its Computer Networks Exploration (CNE) programme. Documents leaked earlier showed that the NSA has been carrying out this kind of cyber operations since 1998. The newspaper said that between 1998 and 2012,the number of hacker attacks more than doubled. A management presentation of the NSA from 2012 showed that the cyber attacks code-named Tailored Access Operations. (TAC) were carried out from a special NSA department,which employed the hackers,the newspaper said. The NSA malware installed on a computer can remain active for several years without being detected and it can be controlled remotely from the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade,in the US,according to the newspaper. ìThese implants acted as digital sleeper cells that can be activated with a single push of a button,î it said.

With a whopping 504 of the 631 seats,59-year-old Merkelís centre-right Christian Democrats Union (CDU) bloc and the SPD now hold a comfortable majority in the Bundestag,the lower house of parliament,under their hard-fought ëgrand coalitioní deal. ìI accept the election result and thank you for your trust,î said Merkel after the confirmation vote in the Bundestag. Smiling,she received a bouquet of flowers and shook hands with other MPs. Germanyís first female chancellor was confirmed by 462 votes on Tuesday,with nine abstentions. For the vote,621 members of parliament were present,of whom 150 voted against Merkel. She would visit President Joachim Gauck at his palace before returning to parliament to be sworn in as Germanyís only third post-war chancellor to win a third four-year term after her mentor Helmut Kohl (1982-1998) and Konrad Adenauer (1949-1963). Germanyís tough stance on fiscal discipline is unlikely to change under the new coalition. The SPD lawmakers voted on Sunday to back the coalition after painstaking negotiations. The party hammered out a minimum national wage,an hourly rate of USD 11.55 that will come into force for the first time in 2015. The new government will be slightly to the left of the previous one,in which the CDU were in coalition with the market-oriented Free Democrats (FDP),BBC reported. But the SPD will form a minority part of the government and no one doubts that Merkel will be in charge. As the EUís most industrialised and populous state,with its biggest economy,Germany dominates decision-making for the eurozone. The Left Party and the Greens have 127 seats,so at least 23 of those who rejected Merkelís nomination were from the parties making up the new coalition. The coalition talks had been the longest for any German government since World War 2. The CDU and SPD finally signed the deal,a 185-page agreement entitled ìShaping Germanyís Futureî,late last month. Merkel was obliged to turn to the SPD after the FDP failed to win any seats in the September election,falling short of the five per cent hurdle to enter the Bundestag.

Britainís Metropolitan Police had received material in August about the deaths of the Princess of Wales and her partner Dodi Al-Fayed in the car crash,which media reports suggested related to claims the Special Air Service (SAS) was involved.

683,"Related. Australiaís highest court struck down a landmark law on Thursday that had begun allowing the countryís first gay marriages,shattering the dreams of more than two dozen same-sex newlyweds whose marriages will now be annulled less than a week after their weddings. The federal government had challenged the validity of the Australian Capital Territoryís law that had allowed gay marriages in the nationís capital and its surrounding area starting last Saturday. For Ivan Hinton,who married his partner Chris Teoh on Saturday,the result was heartbreaking. The couple just received their marriage certificate on Wednesday and immediately applied to change their surnames to Hinton-Teoh. Still,Hinton said he doesnít regret going through with the wedding,and will always consider Teoh his husband. ìThis was an unprecedented and historic opportunity,î he said. ìI wouldnít have missed it for the world.î The federal governmentís lawyer had argued that having different marriage laws in various Australian states and territories would create confusion. The ACT,which passed the law in October,said it should stand because it governs couples outside the federal definition of marriage as being between members of the opposite sex. The High Court unanimously ruled that the ACTís law could not operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act,which was amended in 2004 to define marriage as between a man and a woman. ìThe Marriage Act does not now provide for the formation or recognition of marriage between same sex couples. The Marriage Act provides that a marriage can be solemnised in Australia only between a man and a woman,î the court said in a statement issued alongside its ruling. ìThat Act is a comprehensive and exhaustive statement of the law of marriage.î Rodney Croome,national director of the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality,said his group knows of about 30 same-sex couples who have married since Saturday,though the actual number may be slightly higher. The court decision essentially nullifies their marriages,as it means the ACT law under which they were wed was invalid. Outside the court in Canberra,a tearful Croome,flanked by several same-sex couples who were married in the past week,said the ruling was a defeat for marriage equality but there had been a greater victory this week. ìAnd that victory was the nation saw for the first time,I believe,what is really at the core of this issue-theyíve seen that marriage equality is not about protest or politics or even about laws in the constitution,ultimately. Marriage equality is about love,commitment,family and fairness,î Croome said. In its decision,the court wrote that the federal government is responsible for deciding whether same-sex marriage should be legalized. The ruling means that no Australian state or territory can make that decision,said Sydney University constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey. Lyle Shelton,managing director of Australian Christian Lobby,which opposes same-sex marriage,praised the court ruling and said common sense had prevailed. As for the rulingís impact on the newly-wedded couples,Shelton said it was ìreally sad that they were put in a positionî in which they were allowed to marry before the court handed down its judgment. Prime Minister Tony Abbott opposes gay marriage and his coalition blocked two federal bills last year that would have allowed legal recognition of same-sex partnerships. The ruling comes a day after Indiaís Supreme Court struck down a 2009 lower court decision to decriminalize homosexuality.

Giving in to pressure from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief and former UP CM Mayawati, the civic authorities have shifted a bus stop in front of a sprawling bungalow allotted to her in Lutyensí Bungalow Zone (LBZ), sources said. A few days ago, Mayawati had written to the Delhi Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), demanding that the bus stop outside her bungalow in Lutyensí Delhi be shifted, citing threat to her life. While the Delhi Police asked Mayawatiís office to consult the civic authorities, the bus stop (located opposite her house) was shifted on the directions of the MHA as she is a Z-plus protectee. It is not the first time that Mayawati has made such a request. Earlier, a bus stop outside BSPís office in Jor Bagh was shifted citing security reasons. Mayawati, who was allotted the 3, Thyagraj, Type VIII bungalow two months ago in her capacity as the president of a national party, made the request some days ago to Delhi Policeís security wing. A senior officer said as it was not the policeís job to shift a bus stand, they asked Mayawatiís office to consult the civic authorities, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). An NDMC official confirmed that they had shifted the bus stop. ìIt was an unusual request as all the persons living in that lane are protected persons. The house adjacent to Mayawati is occupied by a senior Coast Guard officer,î a police officer said.

While police are investigating what led to the murders, it is suspected to be a case of marital dispute. The incident was reported from Indira Park, Sagarpur. Police said the 13-year-old niece of the accused, identified as Jaswinder, was the first to discover the murders. She had gone to their house to spend the night. She informed the neighbours who in turn informed police. A PCR call was made at 8.30 am. According to police, the incident took place around 1.30 am when Jaswinderís wife Sarita (35) and their daughter Shalini were asleep. Police said around 9 pm, the family ate dinner and retired to bed. Police said Sarita and Jaswinder usually slept separately. However, that night, Jaswinder asked his niece to sleep in his room as he wanted to discuss something with Sarita. This has led investigators to suspect that the incident may have been planned. Police said around 1.30 am, Jaswinder entered Saritaís room and gagged her and their daughter. He reportedly hit the two of them on their heads repeatedly till they fell unconscious. He immediately fled from the spot but was arrested soon after. After questioning residents in the area police have found that the two had been married for the last 10 years, but never led a peaceful life. According to the residents, Sarita refused to get a divorce, despite the discord.","Taxi driver held for murder of wife, daughter | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/taxi-driver-held-for-murder-of-wife-daughter-2/

Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary of the National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India, said this centre is a unique initiative that aimed to encourage persons living with HIV to be financially independent. Anti-retroviral treatment has brought hopes and increased the life expectancy of infected individuals, but economical empowerment of the people living with HIV (PLHIV) and their family still remains a major challenge, said Pardeshi. Inequity against women and children contribute to their poor access to services and lack of ownership of vital economic livelihood options. Women have lost property and assets after the death of their spouses or are perceived to have HIV/AIDS. They face stigma, rejection and most of the time are evicted from their homes. ìWe see several such cases. While we have approached several corporates for funds, this centre will be set up in association with Emcure pharmaceuticals,î he said. The loss of vital assets and channels of support puts women/widows and their children at greater risk of other infection and exploitation, and limits livelihood options. PLHIV, especially women, experience barriers in almost every aspect of work, including pay, the type of work they are allowed to do, benefits and conditions of work. Currently, 23.9 lakh people are infected with HIV in India, of whom 39 per cent are women and 4.4 per cent are children. (according to NACO annual report 2011-12) For PLHIV, the ability to earn a decent living and support themselves and their families is essential. Achieving PLHIVís economic empowerment is not a quick fix. Creating employment opportunities through skill enhancement will not only deal with economical empowerment but also boost self-confidence of PLHIV and their family members, Pardeshi said, adding that initially Rs 20 lakh will be set aside for the training of PLHIV.",Move to help people with HIV become financially independent | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/move-to-help-people-with-hiv-become-financially-independent/

At a larger level, we can see as the common man getting connected with what is known as the common manís party,î says Bajpai who gave up a 18-year-long media career to enter public life. ìOver 5 lakh people have joined the party across the nation in the first three days of the membership campaign,î adds Bajpai. ìAAPís revolution is nothing less than a second freedom struggle. The party has embarked on an unprecedented mission and people are willingly becoming part of the movement.î Pranjal Nigam, a project manager in an IT firm in Gujarat, echoes similar views. ìThis is a good sign for the party. AAP has a good future. What had started as an anti-corruption movement has now transformed into a revolution of sorts. It signifies that people are considering AAP as a serious political alternative now,î he adds. ìCorporate honchos like V Balakrishnan and Sanyal have set an example for others to serve the nation,î says Nigam. But he is quick to add that the uncertainty over the credibility of AAP still prevails. ìKejriwal and his intentions might be honest, but it is yet to be seen whether those joining now are seeing this as opportunity to get to power.î But there are those like Amit Shukla who see this as a temporary phenomenon. ìThose joining AAP might not be corrupt, but it is too early to say if they would be able to prove themselves as good administrators, that is the key,î explains the 42-year-old political observer. The common manís party might have capitalised on the anti-corruption sentiment to earn the respect and votes of the common man in Delhi. But, will it be able to recreate its success on a national stage with its new bigwigs?

The Congress, meanwhile, says it is banking on its present strength of 20 MPs, several of whom hold key portfolios at the Centre. ìWe already have 20 MPs, all of whom have worked very well, and therefore we need not go on an overdrive to scout for candidates. Our observers had come even before the assembly elections and have given the feedback to the high command.

An inter-ministerial group (IMG) of the coal ministry,constituted to recommend punitive measures against companies idling on their allocated blocks,in its meeting on October 24-25,heard 30 firms on why they failed to develop their mines. After scrutinising the presentations made by the firms,the panel on November 25 recommended de-allocation of 11 mines and forfeiting fully or partially their bank guarantees. These firms include Naveen Jindal-promoted JSPL,SAIL,Rungta Mines,Birla Corporation and Monnet Ispat and Energy. Monnet Ispat and Energy seems to be taking the biggest hit,followed by JSPL,Birla Corporation and Sunflag Iron and Steel and Dalmia Cement JV. The minutes of the meeting,in possession with The Indian Express,reveals that contrary to the popular perception,the companies claimed to have invested a total of around Rs 24,401 in developing their respective blocks. To bolster their contention,these 18 companies have furnished certified investment documents to the IMG. The identical problems which came in the way of developing these mines were difficult land acquisition issues and tardy progress in securing green clearances. Companies like JSPL have even complained that besides difficult and remote terrain they also faced problems from naxalites. The state governments have not been of much help,NTPC told the IMG. It said a key reason why the Pakri Barwadih mine remained undeveloped as the land acquisition issue is pending with the Jharkhand government. The PSU is plagued with similar problem for its Talaipalli mine as the land acquisition issue is pending with the Chhattisgarh government. SAIL,too,is awaiting the mining lease for the Sitanala block. Among the companies asked to furnish BGs include NTPC for Pakri Barwadih and Talaipalli blocks,GVK Power for Tokisud North Block and Jindal Steel and Power for Utkal B1 mine.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has told Bombay High Court the state governmentís 1998 proposal to convert INS Vikrant into a maritime museum did not gather steam after the government ducked the responsibility for its safety. Rear Admiral Shankar S Mathur of the Western Naval Command, in an affidavit filed in the High Court, also said Indiaís first indigenous aircraft carrier is the last of the six aircraft carriers of ìMajestic Classî in the world. These ships were launched in 1943 during World War II, it states. According to the senior navy official, a substantial sum has been spent in maintaining INS Vikrant pending her conversion into a maritime museum. ìAs the government of Maharashtra took the initiative for converting INS Vikrant into a museum, the MoD based on recommendations put forward by the government of Maharashtra, deferred the opening of bids/ auction for the shipís disposal.î He said the deferment was subject to the state government agreeing to arranging an alternative berth for the ship and accepting responsibility for safety of the ship on completion of underwater repairs by the Navy. The reply states that the repairs were completed in January 2000. Mathur said the ministry and Indian Navy have been preserving and maintaining the ship for over 17 years since her decommissioning. After the shipís decommissioning, Rs 22 crore was spent on three essential repairs and dry docking (emptying it from water). The state government sanctioned Rs 5 crore in 2000, whereas the MoD sanctioned the same amount in 2004 and 2010-11, states Mathur. The reply states that the average annual cost of manning and maintaining the ship runs into crores. Naval audit authorities, however, have objected to the positioning of a large number of trained naval personnel to maintain the ship. According to the naval department, INS Vikrant was converted into a museum using in-house naval resources and opened to public in November 2001 without using any public funds. In addition, a training facility for cadets was started in 2006. However, due to its deteriorating condition, it was stopped in 2011. In 2012, the visit by general public was also stopped. The MoDís reply was filed in a public interest litigation (PIL) by activist Kiran Paigankar last month, seeking INS Vikrantís conversion into a national museum instead of being sold as scrap. Paigankarís lawyer Shekhar Jagtap had informed the court that INS Vikrant played a vital role in protecting the sea borders of India during the war against Pakistan in 1971.

(AP Photo) Summary. Demonstrators say they will block major intersections, stop officials going to work and cut off power to key state offices. Schools will close because of fears for students' safety, while US embassy has advised stockpiling a two weeks' supply of food, water and medicine. Related. Thai anti-government protesters began mobilising in Bangkok Sunday, a day ahead of their planned ìshutdownî of the capital as they step up efforts to topple the government and halt upcoming elections. The politically-turbulent country has been shaken by weeks of opposition rallies against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her divisive former premier brother Thaksin, which have caused the government to call snap February 2 polls. Demonstrators, who have vowed to disrupt the vote, began packing possessions and equipment at their main Bangkok rally site as they prepared to fan out to seven locations across the city Monday in an attempt to choke off transport into the capital. ìWe hope everything will change in a good way tomorrow. The change we want to see is for this government to stop being corrupt or they should resign,î said Komol, a protester at the site who gave only one name. The protesters want an appointed ìpeopleís councilî to run the country and oversee vaguely defined electoral reforms before new elections are held in around a year to 18 months. It is the latest chapter in a saga of political instability and occasional unrest that has gripped Thailand since Thaksin was ousted from power by royalist generals seven years ago. The billionaire tycoon-turned-politician, who lives abroad to avoid a jail term for corruption, has large electoral support particularly in his northern Thai heartlands where he is adored for a swathe of popular policies implemented by his and subsequent allied governments. But he is detested among the countryís elites and by many in the Bangkok middle class and Thai south, who see him as authoritarian and accuse him of buying votes. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former MP for the opposition Democrat party that is boycotting the elections, has said he expects a large turnout for the latest demonstration. ìThere will be huge numbers of people from every province joining the shutdown Bangkok mission on Monday 13,î he told a rally late Saturday.

Pakistanis have praised the boy since his teacher told police that he saw Hasan chasing the bomber, who detonated his explosives, killing the teen. On Friday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif praised the boy in a statement, saying his ìbrave act saved the lives of hundreds of students and established a sterling example of gallantry and patriotismî. Sharif advised President Mamnoon Hussain to approve the conferment of Pakistanís Star of Bravery to Hasan, the statement said. The award is given by the president on the advice of the prime minister.

Our school is really proud of himî.† He remembered Hasan as a brave, sincere and an obedient student. Classmate Naseeb Ali also praised Hasan, saying he was a very bold and kind boy. ìWe felt sorry after losing him but we are proud of being his friends,î he said.

A Sunni Muslim sectarian group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, claimed responsibility for the attack. The school is in Hangu, a predominantly Shiíite Muslim area. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi believe Shiíites, who make up about 20 percent of Pakistanís 180 million people, are heretics who should be killed. On Friday, provincial police chief Nasir Khan Durrani recommended Aitezaz for Pakistanís top civilian award. Newspapers ran editorials praising his bravery and contrasted it with the governmentís inaction in the face of militancy. ìFor the sake of Aitezaz and all the countless children that have been taken before their time, somebody from the government needs to take a page out of Aitezazís book and resist terrorists until they can no longer harm Pakistan,î the Nation newspaper said in an editorial.

The plan of the Afghan intelligence of trying to work with the al Qaeda allies was <U+0093>disrupted<U+0094> after United States Special Forces raided an Afghan convoy that was ushering a senior Pakistan Taliban militant Latif Mehsud to Kabul for secret talks last month.

The Afghan intelligence was seeking to work with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in order to find a <U+0093>trump card in a baroque regional power game<U+0094> that will unfold once the American forces withdraw from the country. Afghan officials said the thinking behind this plan was that the Afghans could <U+0093>later gain an advantage<U+0094> in negotiations with the Pakistani government by offering to back. off their support for the militants.

Afghan officials have often complained that the Pakistani military intelligence has sheltered and nurtured the Taliban and supported their insurgency against the Afghan government. The Afghan government no longer wants to be merely the target of a proxy war,according to Afghan officials,and so decided to recruit proxies of its own by seeking to aid the Pakistan Taliban in their fight against Pakistanís security forces. The Afghan officials were beginning to make progress in the plan over the past year but the American raid exposed them and disrupted their plans. Afghan and American officials said the plan to aid the Pakistani Taliban was in its <U+0093>preliminary<U+0094> stages but for the US,it exposed a new level of futility in the war effort. The report said not only has Washington failed to persuade Pakistan to stop using militants to destabilise its neighbours,but this failure appears to have persuaded Afghanistan to <U+0093>try the same thing<U+0094>. Worse still,for American officials,was the Afghans choice of militant allies. Though the Afghan and Pakistan Taliban are operationally distinct,they are loosely aligned. The Pakistani fighters pledge allegiance to Mullah Muhammad Omar,the founder of the Afghan Taliban. In the estimation of American officials,support for <U+0093>one invariably bleeds into assistance for the other<U+0094>,the report said. The Pakistani Taliban shares its base in Pakistanís tribal belt with several Islamist groups,including the remnants of Al Qaedaís original leadership, that have tried to mount attacks in the West. The Pakistani Taliban have also showed a willingness to strike beyond the region,unlike their Afghan counterparts. Mehsud is suspected of having a role in the foiled plot to detonate a car bomb in Times Square in 2010,US officials said.

While the Obama administration was reviewing its surveillance policies,she said the US spy services have ìmore restrictions and oversight than in any other country in history.î Revulsion at spying abuses led to reforms in the 1970s empowering a surveillance court to review NSA eavesdropping and envisaged Congress as a watchdog to check excesses. But rights advocates argue that Congress has failed to hold the NSA to account over the past decade,and that the spy agency also failed to give lawmakers a true picture about its vast digital dragnet of on line traffic and other espionage. US intelligence officials ìrepeatedly misled Congress,î said Greg Nojeim at the Center for Democracy & Technology.","Post 9/11,NSA spying virtually unchecked: Experts | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/post-9-11-nsa-spying-virtually-unchecked-experts/

738,"Summary. Related. Italian center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi faces one of the heaviest blows of his 20-year political career on Wednesday when the Senate votes on stripping him of his seat in parliament over a conviction for tax fraud. The vote will be the culmination of months of political wrangling and is almost certain to lead to Berlusconiís expulsion from the upper house,opening an uncertain new phase for one of Italyís most divisive political figures. The 77-year-old media billionaire,who has dominated politics for two decades,has already pulled his party out of Prime Minister Enrico Lettaís ruling coalition after seven months in government,accusing leftwing opponents of mounting a ìcoup díetatî to eliminate him. The Senate is due to vote at around 7.00 p.m. (1800 GMT) to declare Berlusconi ineligible for parliament after he was convicted of masterminding a complex system of illegally inflated invoices to cut the tax bill for his Mediaset television empire. The court sentenced him to four years in jail,commuted to a year likely to be spent performing community service,and he was also banned from holding public office for two years,preventing any immediate return to government. Under a law passed with Berlusconiís support last year,politicians convicted of serious criminal offences are ineligible for parliament,but his expulsion must first be confirmed by a full vote in the Senate. Both Lettaís center-left Democratic Party (PD) and former comedian Beppe Grilloís anti-establishment 5-Star Movement have declared they will vote against Berlusconi,making it virtually certain that he will be expelled. His removal will have little immediate impact on Lettaís government,which survived a confidence vote on the 2014 budget on Tuesday with the help of a group of some 30 center-right senators who broke away from Berlusconiís party this month. But it will heighten the political tensions that have hampered any serious reforms to Italyís stagnant economy,struggling with youth unemployment of more than 40 percent and stuck in a recession that has lasted more than two years. VICTIM. Once outside,Berlusconi is likely to remain a troublesome opponent for the government,much like Grillo,who does not sit in parliament but who keeps up a steady stream of attacks in public meetings and on his widely read blog. Berlusconiís lawyers dismiss as ìcompletely unrealisticî the possibility that,once his parliamentary immunity is lifted,he may face arrest over a series of other cases,including paying for sex with a minor. Supporters feel a clear sense of injustice and say he has been targeted by leftist judges who have attempted to subvert the political process. ìBerlusconi is a victim of an unjust,anti-democratic battle,î said Forza Italia deputy Annagrazia Calabria. ìNobody can take away the consensus of millions and millions of Italians,all his followers who still believe in him and who have stayed by his side.î Berlusconi joined Lettaís Democratic Party in an unlikely coalition after the deadlocked February election which left no side able to form a government on its own. However,relations were rocky from the start,worsened by rows over tax policy and tensions over Berlusconiís tax fraud conviction in August,only one of a number of legal problems facing the former premier. The split in his center-right party,now rebranded under its original name Forza Italia,may have removed the immediate threat to Letta,who has won two confidence votes in parliament since Berlusconiís conviction. But the government now faces the prospect of a wearying battle with an opposition that is likely to become more bitter in tone with the approach of European parliamentary elections in May,the next major test of support for the government.",Silvio Berlusconi faces expulsion from parliament over tax fraud sentence | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/silvio-berlusconi-faces-expulsion-from-parliament-over-tax-fraud-sentence/

The Indian Navy is well aware that it was a very complicated project to transform a Soviet-built heavy aircraft carrying cruiser with VTOL jump jets into a regular aircraft carrier,î United Shipbuilding Corporation Vice-President Igor Ponomaryov said. ìThe delay will not have any adverse impact on our bilateral cooperation. We have scores of ongoing projects with the Indian Navy,including Indiaís indigenous aircraft carrier project,î he told reporters. India and Russia inked a deal for the USD 2.3 billion aircraft carrier in 2004 but the delivery of the warship has been delayed by almost five years. The project became an irritant in bilateral ties and the two sides signed an additional agreement whereby India agreed to pay a higher price for refitting the carrier. The Vikramaditya will be inducted into the Indian Navy by Defence Minister A K Antony Saturday. Commenting on the whopping cost escalation for the refit and modernisation of the carrier formerly known as Admiral Gorshkov from USD 1.5 billion to USD 2.3 billion,Ponomaryov said,îWe have learnt a lesson about being more careful and meticulous in initial cost evaluation of such unique projects.î Citing an example,he said the Indian Navyís request to modify 18 compartments had resulted in 400 compartments being fully or partially reworked. Ponomaryov noted that Mig-29K fighters had landed and taken off for the first time from Vikramadityaís deck. The chief designer of the project,Sergei Vlasov,now Director General of St Petersburg-based Nevskoe Design Bureau,said it was the most complicated project in his life. ìIt would be wrong to say that it is an old ship. Only its hull is partially old,the rest inside the hull and on the deck is absolutely new,including its highly advanced electronic warfare suite and radars. We changed 2,500 km of cabling,î Vlasov said. He said his design bureau,which has 83 years of experience,is now completing a facility for training pilots for aircraft carriers in Goa and was also involved in Indiaís indigenous aircraft carrier project.",ëDelay in carrier project wonít hit Indo-Russian tiesí | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/delay-in-carrier-project-wont-hit-indorussian-ties/

Director Abhishek Choubeyís debut film had an arresting swagger and a distinct voice, and characters ó full-blooded, full-bodied ó that stayed with you much after the film was over. The sequel has the same two losers, a little worn and weathered, trying their luck in another town, and two new ladies, holding out the promise of one-and-half-times the fun. Fun it is for some time, and then it starts to slide. This one should have been a humdinger, but it falls short. Dedh Ishqiya opens with a great mood, and a ìtameezdaar, ghumaavdaarî Urdu ìlehjaî, which has vanished from the movies, with Naseeruddin and Arshad appearing to be in as much fine nick as in the first film. And for a while, it all goes swimmingly. The made-up town of Mahmudabad takes you back to a time when there were nawaabs, and nazaakat, and a perennial mushaaira swarming with potential poets desirous of grasping the hands of beautiful women. Itís got crackling atmosphere, this town in which our Khaalu (Naseer) and Babban (Warsi) arrive, both as usual on the run. The centre of action is in a ramshackle haveli whose run-downness hints at how grand it used to be, especially now that its resident, the still-lovely, gracefully ageing Begum Para (Dixit), has decided to choose a partner. Khaalu, all done up in a rented sherwani wants to be that man, and not only because he sees Begum Para as his meal ticket, but also because there is history between them. Nothing is simple, though, as twisted feelings simmer below the surface. The Begumís constant companion, the much younger Muniyaa (Qureshi) is busy plotting a kidnapping, and keeping the lusty Babban at bay. But the real competition comes from a love-lorn Jaan Mohammad (Raaz), who has deep feelings for the Begum. The second half dips, and it all becomes a bit too languid, even if things rev up towards the end. There is much to be liked in the film, and I wish all of it had been as good as the scintillating bits. The trouble is not just with the pace.

It doesnít help that he is also a musician on the fringes of the folk music revival of the 1960s in America, with more than a foot but less than his soul in. His partner dead, his first solo album unsold, his agent not forthcoming with any money, Davis spends nights at the home of friends who are kind enough to have him ó or rather not cruel enough to turn him out ó and freezes in the cold without an overcoat. Itís easier to see his failure though as a moral victory, compared to those who ìsold outî, even as he unapologetically helps himself to the resources of the latter. Davis is too churlish to acknowledge talent in others, dismissive of successful acts, and harsh about those not obviously luxuriating in failure as himself. A talented and nice soldier-singer is mocked as a killing machine, a fling, Jean (Mulligan), as a ìcareeristî, and her husband Jim (Timberlake) made fun of his crowd-pleasing notes. The Coen Brothers, whose career is rife with characters like Davis knocking from the outside ó and who could almost be one themselves but to their self-aware amazement arenít ó go their most intimate with Davis. Itís an honest yet unsentimental look at a business that considers itself almost disdainfully different from the very everyday people it celebrates. If Davis is one angle of it, and Jim and the soldier-singer the other, there is also Jean. While married to Jim, she had a fling with Davis, and now doesnít know whose child she is carrying. She blames Davis fully, and much of her anger clearly stems from the fact that she can love him but she ought to choose Jim as he is the one with a home (Davis, who is only too happy with that, doesnít point this out). The film begins with Davis at a club in 1961, singing the most haunting song of the very many in the film.

743,"Related. Almost three years after the controversial decision to exempt the CBI from the purview of the Right To Information Act, it has come to light that the Solicitor-General and the investigating agency itself wanted only partial immunity from the transparency law, but got total exemption from the UPA government. The government felt that exempting the premier investigating agency only partially would lead to other bodies asking for the same, and this push for full exemption was strongly backed by the Prime Ministerís Office, according to file notings and official records accessed by The Indian Express. The documents show that the CBI hesitatingly began its campaign to step out of the transparency regime in July 2010 with the Central Vigilance Commission recommending that only the agencyís special unit ó which deals with collection of intelligence ó be exempted from the RTI Act just as in the case of other intelligence agencies. In its follow-up request filed with the Department of Personnel and Training on February 14, 2011, the agency mentioned that departments related to administration, personnel, accounts/finance, budget and training remain open to disclosures under the RTI Act. This partial exemption formula was backed by the then Solicitor-General Gopal Subramanium. ìI am, however, not convinced that all aspects of the organisation of the CBI must be given exemption,î he wrote in his 23-page opinion, adding that a ìqualificationî be added so that the above-mentioned five departments are retained under the RTI Act. However, the DoPT said this was not feasible and its joint secretary Rajeev Kapoor backed the CBIís original proposal of keeping only its intelligence gathering Special Unit out of the RTI Act. Subsequently though, even this proposal fell out of favour. A DoPT note of April 2011 signed by its Secretary Alka Sirohi said that ìpartial exemption may not serve the purposeÖaccording to the CBI they are in favour of full exemptionî. This note also recorded the anxiety of the PMO to exempt the CBI from the RTI Act. ìIt may also be noted that PMO had also sent us a note sent by Honíble Minister of Law to Honíble Prime Minister where in the Law Minister had indicated that it has been decided to include CBI in the second schedule of RTI Act 2005..íí The second schedule of the law exempts agencies from making disclosures as long as the information sought does not involve allegations of corruption or human rights violations. On April 25, 2011, at a meeting of the Committee of Secretaries ñ chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and attended by M N Prasad, secretary in the PMO ñ the government pushed its argument that partially exempting the CBI from the RTI Act could open a Pandoraís box. ìMaking such a dispensation in the case of CBI may lead to demands for similar qualification to be made in the second schedule in respect of other organizations which may not be feasible in view of the nature of their working,î the minutes of the meeting said. It also said that the proposal for ìpartial exemptionî needed ìre-examinationî and that ìthe DoPT would resubmit the proposal after seeking fresh legal opinionî. This fresh legal opinion was sought from Attorney-General Goolam E Vahanvati. In his opinion dated May 9, 2011, Vahanvati said that partial relief for the CBI ìwill render the whole process of exemption nugatoryÖî ìA qualified exemption will have serious consequences with respect to other intelligence/security organisations already notified. Such a truncated exemption in the case of one agency may lead to serious questions being asked as to why other agencies specified in the second schedule may not be similarly placed, something which is not at all justifiable or feasible. Such an approach, in my opinion will render the whole process of exemption nugatory,î he said. A note written on the same day by S K Sarkar, then additional secretary, DoPT, indicates the PMO was stressing on the CBI being fully exempted. ìM N Prasad, secretary to PM called me twice today to convey that the Law Ministry is obtaining the advice of the Ld. AG on the basis of reference from DoPT on the above subject,î Sarkar wrote. Again, on the covering letter of Vahanvatiís advice dated May 10, 2011, Sarkar noted: ìSecretary to PM (MN Prasad) rang me today to say that the meeting of CoS (Committee of Secretaries) be convened on May 13, 2011 and he be invited. Shri Prasad, I was told, also spoke to Cabinet Secretary today on the subject.î On May 13, the CoS approved the CBI being fully exempted. This was then okayed by the PM on June 7, 2011 and ratified by Parliament two months later.","CBI sought part RTI exemption, Govt gave it full | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/cbi-sought-part-rti-exemption-govt-gave-it-full/

In a move considered unprecedented, the government has asked the public to raise fresh objections, if any, to granting licence to low-fare airline AirAsia India to start commercial operations in the country despite the venture being cleared by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and getting the civil aviation ministryís no-objection certificate. The latest public notice was issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Monday. The notice comes despite AirAsia going through a two-month period last year during which the public and interested parties had time to file objections, if any. AirAsia India is the first airline to be launched since the government in September 2012 allowed 49 per cent FDI in civil aviation from foreign carriers. It is a three-way joint venture among Malaysiaís AirAsia ó Asiaís largest budget airline ó Tata Sons and Telestra Tradeplace. The venture was announced last February and had subsequently been approved by the FIPB and the civil aviation ministry. But the latest DGCA notice offers a 30-day window to ìthe public and all the persons likely to be affected by the grant of this permit to submit their objections or suggestions, if anyî. The notice effectively shifts the timeline set by the airline to start flying by the end of February. A top civil ministry official claimed the notice was unavoidable ìas the government is under a lot of scrutiny from all quartersî and has been issued under existing rules. ìWe could not have skipped it since it would have meant not following rules and opened us to criticism,î the official said. Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh was not available for comment. Responding to an email from The Indian Express, an AirAsia spokesperson said: ìWe will not be able to comment at this point of timeî. Aviation industry insiders, including a retired senior DGCA official, said this was the first time such a public notice had been issued by the government. Since the early 1990s, the government has issued licences to over a dozen airlines but has never issued such a notice, they said. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy went to court last year objecting to the clearance given to AirAsia India to launch an airline. The case pending in the Delhi High Court argues that foreign investment rules for the sector do not allow a new airline to fly in the domestic skies. The civil aviation ministry had itself at one stage argued against the AirAsia proposal claiming that FDI rules did not allow a greenfield airline to be set up but it was overruled. Analysts said they were surprised by the DGCA move as time to seek public comments was over. ìPublic notice should have been before the NOC stage and not at this stage,î said Kapil Kaul, CEO of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, an aviation think-tank. The clearances required now are technical ones to be decided upon by the ministry and the DGCA and there can be no role for the public in them, he said.",DGCA seeks fresh public objections after clearing AirAsia for take-off  | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/dgca-seeks-fresh-public-objections-after-clearing-airasia-for-take-off/

The bubble of euphoria that is making a disturbingly large number of Indians see the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in soft focus needs to be pierced before it is too late. And, as someone who has been wary of Arvind Kejriwal, Anna Hazare and friends from day one, I consider it my duty to perform this task. It will make me less popular than I already am with Leftists, secularists, Stalinists, Leninists et al, but I did not become a political columnist to win a popularity contest. So the venom they spew worries me not one bit. The truth is I worry much more when they agree with something I say, and it is partly because of their unstinting support for AAP that I feel the need to start ringing alarm bells. No matter how good AAP looks at the moment, no matter how humble Kejriwalís demeanour and how sweet the song he sang at his inaugural, we need to be very, very careful. Incidentally, the song that he said was the AAP anthem is from an old Hindi film called Paigham, and it was disingenuous of him not to mention this. I thought it had been written by AAPís resident poet and was quite astonished when a friend pulled it up on YouTube and I spotted Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanthimala in starring roles.

It is due to their action that the women would not have faith in police machinery and therefore,most of the genuine cases are not reported to the police,<U+0094> observed Justice S S Jadhav. <U+0093>It is a sorry state of affairs that when government issues a circular directing the police authorities to call the accused and the complainant in a case registered under section 498A (cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code,the police officers do not call upon the concerned parties,î said the judge. <U+0093>In the present case,when complaint is filed under section 376(rape) of IPC,the police,including women police,have called upon the accused and recorded his statement as if they want to reconcile the dispute between the accused and the. complainant and coerce the latter to withdraw her complaint,<U+0094> the judge observed in her order last week. The court had ordered the Commissioner of Police to personally look into the inquiry of this case,registered at Andheri Police Station on June 25 this year year,and take necessary action against the erring officers. The court asked the police chief to make sure that the action was not taken only to satisfy the court that they have made some attempt to enquire into the conduct of police officers but also to take the inquiry to its logical end. <U+0093>It is necessary to instill faith in women,that their complaints would be inquired into,in accordance with law,<U+0094> said the judge. The accused,who is the vice president of Kantinagar Jain Temple,had surrendered on October 1 at Andheri police station. He contended that the husband of the informant who is the templeís secretary,was instrumental in prosecuting him. The complainant and her husband had made a representation to Assistant Commissioner of Police Pradeep Sonavane on August 17 this year. However,no action was taken on their complaint. Later,a separate representation was made to the Commissioner of Police on September 11 this year. ACP Sonavane,who was present in the court,admitted that there has been a mess in investigation of this offence. He contended that it was at his behest that the crime was registered against the accused. Even sub-inspector Raisa Shaikh was present in the court and she too admitted that the complainant had approached the police station in August last year and that she had referred the case to police inspector Bhalerao. However,no action was taken by Bhalerao,she told the court. Assistant police inspector Valunj was also present in the court but he did not answer as to why he had summoned the accused on August 26,2012,and recorded his statement under section 161 of CrPc,the judge noted in her order. <U+0093>API Valunj has taken it (statement of accused) as a gospel truth and has in his own powers released the accused as if it was a bailable offence,<U+0094> said the judge. <U+0093>It is necessary to hold an enquiry of all the officers concerned including PI Bhalerao,Sr PI Valunj,Sr PI Pradeep Gosavi and PSI Raisa Shaikh<U+0094>,the judge ruled. <U+0093>The DCP shall also hold an inquiry in respect of the application dated 17th August,2013 and dated 11th September,2013,wherein signature of the complainant is forged on a typed written statement revealing therein that the complainant had consensual sex with the accused and that she had accompanied him to various sites,<U+0094> the judge noted.",Cops facing probe for messing up rape case: Govt to HC | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/crime/cops-facing-probe-for-messing-up-rape-case-govt-to-hc/

Claiming that global experience showed FDI leads to job losses and that Delhi is not prepared for FDI, the two-week-old Aam Aadmi Party government in the capital Monday announced that it had withdrawn the approval given to FDI in multi-brand retail by the previous Congress government. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the decision was taken to address the huge problem of unemployment in Delhi and that it had been communicated to the Union commerce and industries ministry through a letter on January 1. The new CM also stressed that his party was not against FDI per se but that the decision on FDI ìought to be decided on sector to sector basisî. But the Centre said the Delhi government could not reverse this decision just like that. ìMy first reaction is that states cannot just walk in or out of this commitment. Those which had accepted they will allow FDI under multi-brand retail had signed a legal agreement with us, based on which we had issued the notification,î Commerce Minister Anand Sharma told The Indian Express. Sharma said he would have to check on the details with officials in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion ìbut that is how I see it at presentî. Kejriwal said withdrawing FDI from multi-brand retail was part of the AAP manifesto. ìWhatever information is available shows if there is FDI in retail, it improves consumer choices, however, experience worldwide shows that it leads to loss of jobs worldwide also,î Kejriwal said. Last year, the central government permitted 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail trading and left its implementation to the states. While Congress-ruled states had agreed to implement the policy, Delhi has become the first to change its mind. ìThe data of the centre is not corroborated by the experience worldwide. Unemployment is a huge issue in Delhi presently and it came down to being a decision between addressing unemployment issues in the city and providing consumers with choices, and I chose the former,î Kejriwal said. ìThere is no conducive environment provided to the retail sector to start business. This sector faces so much corruption in every stage. In the next few days, I will hold a meeting with people from industries and traders to ask what kind of bottlenecks are faced by them and what can be done to generate wealth,î the CM said. ìWe are committed to creating an honest environment which is corruption-free and the anti-corruption helpline is a move towards this. With the proper environment expansion of retail trade is possible,î he said.

Those found absent twice during routine checks could face cancellation or suspension of registrations as this amounts to misconduct, according to the Medical Council of India (MCI) rules. After the state health department issued a notice regarding this three weeks ago, 304 doctors ó who were appointed as medical officers at primary health centres (PHCs) or rural hospitals ó have responded. Maharashtraís Director of Health Dr Satish Pawar, who was in Pune on Monday, said as many as 1,190 posts of medical officers are vacant in rural areas. ìDespite so many notifications, showcause notices and warnings of administrative action, doctors have not paid heed to the government rule of joining rural service. We only hope that after this order, doctors start joining rural postings and the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) does not have to take stern action against them,î said Dr Kishore Taori, chairman of MMC. It was when Pawar came across a 2002 notification of MCI ó which said if doctors remain absent for two consecutive times at rural postings it would amount to misconduct ó that he decided to approach the MMC. An order was immediately circulated mid-December that such doctors should report for duty, failing which their names would be recommended for cancellation or suspension of registration, Pawar said. Dr Kanchan Jagtap, Deputy Director of Health, Pune, said they have zeroed in on 12 doctors. So far, one doctor has sent his response. ìThe doctor has a private practice and has not reported for duty at a PHC for the past seven years,î Jagtap said. Most of the doctors have a private practice and hence donít join rural postings. Either they quit or then join the service, she said. ìWe have been filling many posts and so far there are five to six vacancies at 96 PHCs in Pune, while five at 24 rural hospitals,î she added. At the state level, too, Pawar pointed out that interviews are being conducted for the vacant posts. According to Taori, most of the times, doctors donít join rural services as they havenít got a posting of their choice. For instance, radiologists, who specially train in their discipline, are often disappointed when they are sent to centres where there is limited scope to practise sonography. ìHowever, such cases are being considered and suitable posts are being allotted,î Pawar added.",ëRegistration of docs who donít take up rural postings can be cancelledí | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/registration-of-docs-who-dont-take-up-rural-postings-can-be-cancelled/

Kedari has ìadmittedly not repaid the loanî to any of the lenders, according to the report. Last week, Newsline had reported that Kedari was unhappy with the report listing his purchase as ìbenamiî and had said he will move court challenging the tag. Talking about Kedariís 650 sq ft flat priced at Rs 59 lakh, the 650-page report ó which has been uploaded on the state government website ó states: ìHe raised the amount by borrowing Rs 28 lakh from Parveen Nayyar, Rs 20 lakh from Amit Thepade and Rs 10 lakh from Sunil Advani.î According to the report, Kedari executed an unregistered mortgaged deed dated February 4, 2009, in respect to his flat in Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society. As per the mortgage, the lenders can take possession of his flat in case he fails to repay the loan. As per the report, not only has Kedari not made the repayment of the loan, but the transaction entered has no permission either from the collector or the government. Interestingly, Thepade extended the loan of Rs 20 lakh to Kedari without even knowing him. ìThis is the only case where I had given loan to a person who is not known to me personally. I have not informed Adarsh CHS about the loan given by me to Kedari,î the report quotes Thepade as saying in his statement. Interestingly, Kedari had told this reporter that the amounts were paid by lenders directly to Adarsh CHS by cheques, in which case the names of his lenders were revealed to the society. According to the report, the Rs 10-lakh loan extended by Advani to Kedari was given on the basis of an undated, unregistered promissory note ó similar to one he made with Thepade ó without any security. ìHe (Advani) has further stated that he has not given any legal notice nor filed any civil suit against Kedari for repayment of the loan amount,î the report states. Kedari, had, however told this reporter that the lenders have been after him for repayment of the loan. ìKedari belongs to a Scheduled Caste (SC) category and as per the evidence of Parveen, he used to visit her for doing domestic workÖAdmittedly, he has not made repayment of any loan to the persons from whom he borrowed the amount,î it states. Kedari had said that he intended to rent out his Adarsh flat and then repay the loan, and that he is being targeted because he belonged to the SC category.

For, the High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Advisor to UT Administrator; Chandigarh Home Secretary and Mehra on a public interest litigation (PIL). Jointly filed by Advocate HC Arora and RTI activist RK Garg, the petition demanded quashing of the notification dated November 8 last vide which the PCA was reconstituted and Mehra was appointed chairman. The petitioners have contended that a PCA can only be headed by a retired Supreme Court or high court judge. The petitioners have also referred to a Supreme Court judgment which makes it mandatory for the state government or Administration to seek a panel of judges from the concerned Chief Justice of the high court for selecting chairman of the authority. The Supreme Court judgment, dated September 22, 2006 in which the Apex Court had directed all states/UTs to constitute PCA explicitly states that a state government/UT will have to seek a panel of names proposed by the Chief Justice. The relevant para of the judgment reads ìState-level authority may be headed by a retired Judge of the high court/Supreme Court. The head of the state-level complaints authority shall be chosen by the state out of a panel of names proposed by the Chief Justice.î Significantly, the administration did not seek a panel of names from the high court. To corroborate their claim, the petitioners have produced information gathered under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Advocate HC Arora said, the notification dated June 23, 2010 under which PCA was initially constituted is illegal. For, according to Arora, the notification makes an IAS officer of secretary-level also eligible for appointment as chairperson of the authority. After the term of the three-member PCA had expired, the authority was reconstituted on November 8 last. It has been further argued that while appointing Mehra as chairperson of the authority, the names were short-listed earlier by Deputy Commissioner, Chandigarh and Inspector General of Police, Chandigarh Police, which were processed by UT home secretary. Thereafter, the UT administrator appointed Mehra as chairman though his name was not included in the list of people short-listed by the home secretary.

He and his parents are least bothered about the weakening of the rupee against the dollar and its negative impact on the cost of overseas education. This is not due to his affluent background but because he will be pursuing the programme at the Gurgaon campus of the foreign university. This dream of thousands,may be millions,of Indian students aspiring for world-class foreign education at rupee cost may soon become reality if the government has its way. It is common knowledge that the MHRD had formulated the Foreign Education Providers Bill in 2010 to permit foreign universities to set up campuses in India. The Bill,however,has been awaiting Parliamentary nod for a long time. Given the existing situation,we now understand that the government is in the process of finalising regulations that seek to achieve the objectives defined under the aforesaid Bill. This development has been confirmed by the education minister while replying to a question in Parliament. The Bill,in its current form,had placed certain conditions,such as a minimum corpus of R500 million and restriction on ploughing back of profits on foreign universities desirous of setting up a campus in India. In the past few years,some of these onerous conditions have been a subject of intense debate in the industry. As per some industry experts,such conditions will put off some of the most prestigious global universities to invest in the Indian market. We will have to wait and watch as to how many of these conditions are prescribed under the proposed regulations. These regulations have become all the more important for an Indian student eyeing overseas degrees given the recent fall in the value of the rupee. To quote statistics,the rupee has depreciated by about 9% in the last month itself with analysts predicting new lows in the near future. Further,the monthly average value of rupee versus dollar in the last one year indicates a fall of nearly 13% in value. The accompanying table clearly indicates that the cost of pursuing an MBA from Stanford University has gone up by around 17% due to the weakening rupee. Please note that the additional burden on the student is even more significant as social costs of living have not been included in this calculation. In today<U+0092>s tough economic situation,this is bound to impact the plans of the aspiring middle class seeking overseas education for their wards. The proposed regulations can thus provide a breather by providing access to quality higher education at an affordable cost and transform the entire landscape of higher education system in the country. The foreign universities are expected to introduce global best practices in pedagogy,curricula,research and training. In order to meet the new benchmark,the domestic education players would be forced to improve the quality of their service offerings also. In addition,the domestic campuses of foreign universities would also help the government in keeping a check on brain-drain as most of the academically brilliant students,who currently pursue education overseas,generally tend to accept foreign job offers. In the past,institutions such as Duke University,Virginia Tech,University of Southern California and many more have openly expressed their interest in setting up a campus in India. Such institutions are expected to revive their India plans on notification of the proposed regulations. With over 50% of the populations below 25 years,annual enrolment of over 21 million students in higher education and GER of around 18% the country offers an attractive proposition for such institutions. We believe this is certainly a step in the right direction and is expected to reap rich benefits in the long run.

759,"The proposed university would come up at Sonia Gandhiís constituency of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh. Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh moved the Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University Bill,2013 which provides for creation of this central university on a 26 acre plot at the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Udaan Academy at Fursatganj in Rae Bareli. It was passed after a short discussion. Speaking before the Bill was put to vote,Singh allayed fears of members on privatisation of airports. ìI want to say that all these airports in the country will continue to be owned by the Airports Authority of India,î he said,adding that any construction or development of the existing airports will be done on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis. He also said his ministry is working on opening more domestic airports in the country and may expand the airports of the Air Force for this purpose in some districts. Initiating the debate on the bill,Ananth Kumar (BJP) questioned the logic behind setting up the proposed university in Rae Bareli. ìRae Bareli is an aviation desert. It should be set up in Bangalore,where all the required infrastructure is present,î he said. Kumar also questioned why the proposed institution is being named after late Rajiv Gandhi. He said while he had nothing against the former Prime Minister,the university could have been named in the memory of M Vishveshwariah who was behind the creation of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. He accused Congress members of indulging in sycophancy by naming various schemes after Rajiv Gandhi and wondered why the Civil Aviation Minister,who heads RLD,had to be part of that. The university,an autonomous body under administrative control of the Civil Aviation Ministry,would have an estimated funding of Rs 202 crore during the 12th Plan period,of which Rs 80 crore has already been sanctioned by the Centre. The need for the university was felt due to the ìmarked absence of credible institutions imparting specialised technical and managerial training in air transportation,safety,security and regulatory areas,î the billís Statement of Objects and Reasons said. ìThe opportunity cost of not investing in human resources required for the civil aviation sector in India at this juncture would result in reduced growth,increased cost of operations,compromise on safety and missed opportunities,î it said. The varsity would promote aviation studies,training and research with focus on emerging areas like aviation management,aviation regulation and policy,aviation history,aviation science and engineering,aviation law,aviation safety and security and aviation medicine. During the debate on the Bill,Shailendra Kumar (SP) said while he supported the bill,he wanted the Centre to set up new institutions in other parts of UP. ìYou already have a Rail Coach Factory,petroleum institute and a womenís university there. Everything need not be in either Rae Bareli or Amethi,î he said. Gorakhnath Pandey (BSP) also supported the measure but said similar institute should be set up Bhadoi which has ample land. Saugata Roy (TMC) lamented a lack of standardisation in courses offering training in various branches of civil aviation. He also attacked companies like GMR and GVK,which he alleged,were not doing a good job in modernising airports.

Besides SRCC and Gargi,which are located near heritage sites protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI),eight structures under DU are heritage buildings <U+0097> the university office,the Gwyer Hall in North Campus,St Stephen<U+0092>s College,St Stephen<U+0092>s College chapel,IP College for Women,Tibbia College,St Stephen<U+0092>s College Teachers<U+0092> Hostel and Guard House,and Hindu College. Gargi College had to wait for two years to secure approval for a new academic block <U+0097> a three-and-half storeyed structure <U+0097> from the National Monuments Authority (NMA). Having moved past the NMA,the plan is now stuck with the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). <U+0093>It took us almost two years to get the approval of heritage authorities. The new block will have additional classrooms and laboratories,<U+0094> principal Shashi Tyagi said. SRCC has long felt the need to add more classrooms and hostels for its growing number of students. But the college<U+0092>s proximity to the Rajpur Cemetery has become a stumbling block in the way of its expansion. When SRCC wanted to construct a building to accommodate its growing number of students,it had to seek the ASI<U+0092>s permission. After a long wait,the files are now stuck with the MCD. <U+0093>SRCC falls within 183 m of the Rajpur Cemetery. We have given the college authorities permission to construct a building up to 13 m high,<U+0094> said Vasant Kumar Swarnkar,superintending archaeologist and head of ASI<U+0092>s Delhi region. Yogender Mann,Director (public relations),MCD (South),told Newsline that around a month ago,SRCC<U+0092>s case was taken up by its Buildings department. <U+0093>It found that the current building was not in accordance with the original layout. So we asked them to rectify the layout plan and come back for permission,<U+0094> he said. On Gargi College,Swarnkar said: <U+0093>It is very close to Siri Fort,which is under ASI protection. They want to construct a conference hall close to the boundary wall of the fort,which is the bone of contention between them and the ASI. The case has come up several times and is still pending resolution.<U+0094> Similarly,Hindu College plans to add an academic block to its infrastructure. While the process for seeking approval from various authorities began in 2009,the college has still not been able to start construction. The college,located within 200 metres of the Chauburja mosque,had to wait for around two years to get the approval of the heritage authorities. <U+0093>Because of its proximity to the mosque,we needed the approval of the heritage authorities. While the plan was with the ASI earlier,after the formation of the NMA we had to seek approval from them,<U+0094> Principal Pradyumn Kumar said. <U+0093>All these processes are taking a lot of time. The problem is not just the multiple authorities which need to be approached for approval,it is also regarding the 10-12 provisions that each approval requires,<U+0094> Kumar added. For example,a college has to submit a range of reports to obtain clearance from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). <U+0093>For DPCC<U+0092>s approval,we need a geo-technical report and a sewage report,among others. We appointed a surveyor towards the end of 2011 for the purpose,<U+0094> Kumar said. The college had approached the DPCC in 2010. Kamala Nehru College,too,received approval from the NMA only around three months ago. <U+0093>The college has been battling with regulatory authorities since 2004-05 for approval to add another floor to its existing building. The DDA has to give the final approval,<U+0094> Principal Minoti Chatterjee said. On the other hand,Ram Lal Anand College,which plans to build a women<U+0092>s hostel and a new academic block,was asked to pay a fee of Rs 20 crore for its Rs 8-crore project by the DDA. <U+0093>The governing body chairman of the college has asked for an appointment with the L-G. The college,along with four other colleges,had also met senior officials at the Directorate of Higher Education some weeks back to apprise them of the situation,<U+0094> principal Vijay K Sharma said. To look into these problems,the DU administration has set up an infrastructure committee. Colleges maintain that while the university has taken measures to look into the issue,the government needs to do the same. Pradyumn Kumar said,<U+0093>There should be some nodal agency which has members from the university and regulatory authorities. It can provide a single-window clearance to all colleges.<U+0094>","For these Delhi colleges,the past stands in way of future | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/education/for-these-delhi-colleges-the-past-stands-in-way-of-future/

762,"Related. A change in the fee payment policy of the IITs could well be on the cards to augment fiscal resources of these institutes as fees under the present system are paid only by about 50 per cent of the students. Fee revenue at present constitutes just 7-10 per cent of total non-plan expenditure of an IIT. Under the existing system,fees for about 22 per cent of students from the SC/ST category are fully waived. Besides,up to 25 per cent of the students,whose parental annual income is less than Rs 4.5 lakh,are entitled to a fee-waiver. The remaining students pay the full fee. Against this backdrop,the IIT council,in its meeting here on September 3,is expected to examine the proposal for a change in the fee payment policy. A study by IIT Bombay,suggests that all students should pay the fees and those who are exempted from paying fees under government policy should receive the required amount of funds as fee-scholarship through the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme. IITs meet most of their expenses such as salaries and staff cost which are fixed through financial grants from HRD Ministry. The Planning Commission as well as the Department of Expenditure,Ministry of Finance has also highlighted the need to increase the fee revenue,sources said. The council could also consider a dedicated technical cadre to free the faculty members of extra administrative load and help them devote more time to teaching and research activities. An acute shortage of technical manpower especially in the older IITs is being increasingly felt as a result of the growing engagement with research and new equipment that requires different technical skill sets. A high number of non-faculty staff,due to legacy,has further reduced the space for hiring trained technical staff. Keeping this in mind,the IITs would push a proposal for the technical cadre at the next IIT council meeting,sources said. ìThe aim of the proposal for creating a technical cadre is to free the faculty from lab/workshops responsibilities and enable them to devote their time to teaching and research,î they said. The standing committee of IIT council has suggested that in order to meet the urgent requirement of technical Staff,as an interim measure,IITs may start recruitment process in this cadre against anticipated attrition of non-technical,non-faculty posts.",IITs may change fee payment policy | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/education/iits-may-change-fee-payment-policy/

Four Frenchmen taken hostage by al-Qaeda extremists in Niger have been released after three years of captivity and a French-led military intervention in the region that weakened the Islamic radicals. French President Francois Hollande announced the release yesterday and credited Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou,who later appeared on television with the hostages. The men,who worked for the Areva nuclear company when taken,had long beards and some wore turbans and brown robes. They did not speak. Niger Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Bazoum said the hostages Pierre Legrand,Thierry Dol,Marc Feret and Daniel Larribe were freed in neighbouring Mali and taken to Niamey,Nigerís capital. Officials gave few details on the release,but the French defence minister said there was no assault and that France did not pay a ransom. ìThere was an initiative taken by the networkî of the Niger president ìwhich allowed the liberation without a clash,î Jean-Yves Le Drian told Franceís TF 1 television.

Speaking from there on French TV,Fabius said the freed captives are ìin good shapeî now that ìthe nightmare is over.î He added that the group would reach home by today morning. The four freed Frenchmen were captured in September 2010 by the North African wing of al-Qaida and spirited from their dormitories in the town of Arlit,Niger,where Areva,a French state-run nuclear company,operates a uranium mine. Officials had long suspected the hostages were being held in northern Mali,a harsh desert area where there is no tree cover and the blazing midday heat can soar to 40 degrees Celsius. Previous hostages have recounted being bitten by scorpions. The question of whether ransom was paid to procure their release immediately rose to the fore. Hollande had made clear his government would not pay ransoms to free French captives.

771,"Related. President Barack Obama knew about the US National Security Agencyís (NSA) spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for some years and he also personally approved it,according to a report published Sunday. Obama was informed about the NSAís tapping of Merkelís mobile phone already in 2010 by its director Keith Alexander. The president ìnot only did not stop the operation,but he also ordered it to continue,î Bild am Sonntag newspaper said quoting a high-ranking NSA official. The White House later ordered the spy agency to prepare a detailed dossier on the chancellor. President Obama did not trust Merkel and wanted to know everything about her,Bild said said quoting the official,who was not identified. Subsequently,the NSA stepped up its surveillance of Merkel and snooped into all conversations with her mobile phone used for communicating with her party colleagues,the newspaper said. The agency also cracked the codes of a new supposedly tap-proof mobile phone she has been using since the middle of this year,the newspaper said. This showed that the NSA continued its spying on the chancellor until very recently,it said. Merkelís conversation from her office via fixed line phones,which she used to communicate with other world leaders,was secure from eavesdropping,the newspaper said. A report Sunday claimed that President Obama had assured chancellor Merkel during a telephone conversation last Wednesday that he was not aware of the NSAís spying on her. When Merkel called him to complain about the suspected surveillance by the NSA,President Obama told her that he would have stopped it if he knew about it,Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported. Bild said President Obamaís interest in information about Merkel was evident from the fact that intelligence gathered by the NSA did not go as usual to its headquarters in Fort Meade,in Maryland,but directly to the White House. Another report in weekly news magazine Der Spiegel said NSA may also have spied on the entire government complex in Berlin from the nearby American embassy. The chancellorís mobile phone number was on a list of NSA monitoring targets found in classified documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The documents revealed that the spy agency started its surveillance of Merkelís mobile phone in 2002 when George Bush was in the White House. The relations between president Obama and Merkel have been difficult from the very beginning,Bild newspaper said. Merkel denied Obama a chance to address the German public from the Brandenburg Gate during his election campaign in 2008. Besides personal differences,there are also conflicts over policy issues. Obama very often criticised her course in the euro zone debt crisis. The US government was irritated by Germanyís decision to stay out of the Libyan conflict,Bild said.

As the first indications of the NSAís spying on Merkel emerged last week,the German foreign ministry summoned US ambassador John B Emerson to express its concern.

773,"In February 2009,when Nine Inch Nail<U+0092>s Trent Reznor announced that the band would be taking a hiatus,his collaboration with Atticus Ross (on The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) and Mariqueen Mandig (frontwoman of West Indian Girl fame and later his wife) ensured he never really left the scene. Nearly five years later,NIN<U+0092>s eighth studio album Hesitation Marks is promising. Reznor<U+0092>s signature foreplay with noise and imagery makes a come-back,with the addition of minimalist,almost danceable (or let<U+0092>s say sway-able) beats and the timely injection of mature,melodic vocals. Hesitation Marks refers to the wounds before an attempted suicide. Pin-pricked beats,distorted sounds,oscillations between shadow vocals and full-blown screams and desolate lyrics mark Copy of,Come back haunted,In two and All time low. Reznor departs from this predictability with Find my way,which has a heavy piano influence,a rare falsetto,and relatable vocals,and Everything,which can be best described as a grunge-rock version of Gloria Gaynor<U+0092>s I will survive. Words like <U+0093>dark<U+0094>,<U+0093>emo<U+0094> or even <U+0093>crazy<U+0094> have often been used to describe NIN<U+0092>s sound. Various methods of escape,Disappointed and Satellite,however,are different. Running has whacky,tribal beats that almost make your eyes pop out the first time you hear it. While I<U+0092>m still here and Black noise blend into each other,dismissing the idea of a timeline,borrowing choruses,and beats. The beauty of Reznor<U+0092>s experimentation is that he takes his time to merge the NIN identity with a new sound. Reznor is sober,and married with children now,but he has spoken earlier about his alcohol and drug abuse. You can feel the transformation,as NIN oscillates from whispers to screams,to now whispering screams in Hesitation Marks. The looming industrial and techno sound can be attributed to Atticus Ross,who has worked with Reznor on a studio album for the first time. There is a slight The Social Network hangover to the album,but not enough to complain about. Over the years,NIN<U+0092>s music has moved from adrenalised aggression to a digital,minimal and self-reflective sound,and Hestitation Marks is the cherry on the cake.",Cherry on the cake | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/cherry-on-the-cake/
774,"Related. Bubble gums,strawberry blonde hair and a reckless attitude worn on her sleeve with a middle finger shown to the world,Avril Lavigne was the ultimate <U+0093>punk princess<U+0094>. Or so we thought in our teens. But with a pinch of nostalgia and an indulgent attitude we were surprised to see that 29-year-old Lavigne <U+0097> even after her 5th studio album and epic tracks such as Sk8er Boi to Girlfriend and the underrated number Complicated <U+0097> had not grown up. Her album,also titled Avril Lavigne,consists of 13 tracks and features several artistes,including Chad Kroeger and Marilyn Manson. The album opens with the number Rock n Roll. With a comic book-inspired video and lyrics such as,I ain<U+0092>t never gonna cover up that tattoo,the album also has some very interesting guitar riffs. In the next number,Here<U+0092>s to never growing up,Lavigne raises the aforementioned middle finger to the world at large,and shows the world the price of living in Neverland. The next track,17,which talks about her teen years,is accompanied by her powerful voice,a steady and strong beat and acoustic strums. Bitchin<U+0092> summer talks about the end of school (almost a decade has passed since Lavigne<U+0092>s high school days,oh my!) as she sings <U+0093>I<U+0092>ll pick you up at the liquor store/Hurry up,we can fit one more,<U+0094> convincingly. We were surprised to see her collaborative number with her husband and Nickelback frontman Kroeger<U+0092>s number called Let go,to be a painful break-up song. While Lavigne holds perfectly on her own,Kroeger doesn<U+0092>t sound <U+0093>right<U+0094> with her. While Bad girl,featuring Manson,is a funky,cheeky rock-inspired number,Hello kitty is a sort of a meh number,as Lavigne tries her hand with techno-pop. The last track on the album,Hush hush,is our definite favourite. A surprisingly deep number,Lavigne mixes complicated emotions,ranging from heartbreak to regret,in an enticing pop-inspired manner. Lavigne<U+0092>s latest album is like a road trip you take with friends. While there are many super-awesome moments,there are some nap-inducing times as well.

775,"Related. A friend once remarked that a sign of an iconic rock band selling out is when they get rid of their untamed locks. He quickly rattled off some names,cautioning that the only entity in rock this does not apply to is Eddie Vedder,Pearl Jam<U+0092>s vocalist. Would he strike Vedder<U+0092>s name off from his list of exceptions after their latest: the pop-rock-heavy Lightning Bolt? I think not. Sell-out is too harsh for a band which has helped pioneer grunge,which in turn exemplified the alternative music scene of the early 90s. Pearl Jam<U+0092>s contribution to rock goes beyond just modelling a genre. Lightning Bolt,their 10th offering,opens with Getaway,a spunky starter cast in a tight and safe verse-chorus-verse format. Written by Vedder,the song tips its hat to Backspacer<U+0092>s punk vibe and makes way for the more orthodox Mind your manners. Released on July 11 as a single,the song inherits the recessive angry gene from the Riot Act days. Mind your manners is the only song where Mike Mc Cready,PJ<U+0092>s lead guitarist,lashes out a brief,speedy,sweeping solo. Let it not spoil you and leave you pining,for the album<U+0092>s posterity do not bear McCready<U+0092>s gems. The anger and energy that peaks with Mind your manners,slumps with My father<U+0092>s son. Enter acoustic guitars and a serenading Vedder asking the listener to Hear the sirens. This was the second teaser to the album,which was released as a single on September 8,probably to balance Mind your manners<U+0092> projection of the album. The ballady Sirens is fit to serve as the album<U+0092>s mascot,bringing us to the title song Lightning bolt,which makes you understand why Pearl Jam is often credited for keeping classic rock alive and thriving. Lightning bolt is a dazzler,and if we were playing the guitar riffs to this song,we<U+0092>d definitely fit in a trademark Angus Young foot-tap,while playing the chorus and throw in some Jimmy Page swagger and jive during the solo. The rest of the songs from the dozen in the album are alt-rock and new wave explorations,not making much effort to tread musical landscapes beyond the genres<U+0092> horizons. Towards the end,the band makes a couple of clean offerings <U+0097> Sleeping by myself and Yellow moon. Like Woody Allen,Pearl Jam works on the quantity principle. While the former has been belting out a movie each year for nearly half a century now,PJ has been cutting an album every two years for a little over two decades. True to both their cases,the sea of genius sometimes witnesses oil-spills. Here<U+0092>s looking forward to the greatest PJ album ever.

776,"Related. We all know Janelle Mon·e as the funky girl who featured in fun.<U+0092>s hit single,We are young. But apart from her pop success,one of the things that struck us about the American musician and record producer was the meaningful use of themes in her work. Take her first EP,Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase) (2007),in which she followed a fictional tale of Cindi Mayweather,a mass-produced android from the year 2719 for a market in a rigid futuristic society. Her debut studio album,The ArchAndroid,took that tale further,incorporating conceptual elements of Afrofuturism (a school of thought that looks at the effects of technology on African art and culture) and science fiction. With her second studio album,The Electric Lady,the 27-year-old has done an interesting psychedelic pop-infused take on the story of the lone robot in a dystopian world. The album,which is divided in two parts,the Suite IV and Suite V,begins with the song Suite IV electric overture,a bold yet nostalgic theme-song-like composition,which would fit well in a Bond movie of the <U+0092>70s. The next number,Givin emí what they love,features Prince,and is a powerful number,with Mon·e<U+0092>s strong vocals blending perfectly with the deep,resonating beats. Q.U.E.E.N,featuring neo-soul artiste Erykah Badu,is a fast-paced,psychedelic number,in which Mon·e asks,<U+0093>Am I a freak for dancing around<U+0094> While Electric lady,featuring Beyonce<U+0092>s sister Solange Knowles,is an out-and-out pop-inspired sing-song number,Primetime,featuring American recording artiste Miguel,is a soft,ballad-like track,with plentiful choruses and robust beats. Ghetto woman is a fast-paced and funky <U+0092>80s-inspired song,in which Mon·e croons,<U+0093>Some say this ghetto land will take you down and poison you/ Some say she can do all the things a man can do.<U+0094> Victory is one of our favourites from the album,with powerful,electric beats,mingled with tinkling sounds and Mon·e<U+0092>s powerful voice. She can be very poignant and deep when she wants,especially as she sings,<U+0093>Cause to be victorious/ You must find glory in the little things.<U+0094> With 19 songs,with radio-inspired commentary holding the theme together,Mon·e has vividly taken the story of the lone robot forward in a peppy,funky and nostalgic way <U+0097> touching aspects such as feminism,culture,literature and. technology,among others.

777,"Me captain,you team: Very vain,very†effective. Summary. That's Imran Khan. Out to slay the 'circus ke sher' (of Nawaz Sharif),solve Pakistan's problems: thrash the thieves,get a driving licence,shoot down the drones,spook the West into giving you a visa. All you need is his bat,the magic wand that's,curiously,cast a spell. Thatís Imran Khan. Out to slay the ëcircus ke sherí (of Nawaz Sharif),solve Pakistanís problems: thrash the thieves,get a driving licence,shoot down the drones,spook the West into giving you a visa. All you need is his bat,the magic wand thatís,curiously,cast a spell. If you wanted to be so boringly accurate,wounded tiger is a description that will fit Imran Khan,now that he runs his campaign from his mobile phone,his battered trunk all bruised and bandaged. But he may not like that. Because tiger is now identified with the opposition. Or rather,more fitting,given the way he has run his campaign,with his enemy. In so many years,in fact,decades of covering electoral politics,I have never seen a more rude and vain campaign. What matters,however,is that it is working for him. <U+0093>Main tumhara captain,aur tum meri team,<U+0094> he often tells his crowds. Now,when did you last hear that? Come election time,and your politician becomes the very epitome of humility and grace before the voter. Not a tiger,but a bheegi billi. Instead of the <U+0093>Me captain,you my team<U+0094> exhortation,he is more likely to say you are the masters of my destiny,and me forever your humble servant. Not Imran. His detractors dismiss him as an incurable case of <U+0093>I<U+0094> disease. But he doesn<U+0092>t bother. And his voters love it. All the metaphors and messages he uses are rude,macho and disdainful of all opposition. <U+0093>Main circus ke sheron ko maarne aaya hoon (I am here to kill the circus lions),<U+0094> he says,and the crowds cheer. Then he swings a cricket bat (his election symbol),like a pehelwan flaunts his mace in an akhara,and announces his plan to publicly whip the 500 <U+0093>biggest looters<U+0094> of Pakistan a day after the election. Crowds cheer again. Then he promises to shoot down the first American drone that enters Pakistani airspace once he becomes prime minister. Cheers get louder. And you cannot but shiver looking at the number of people in the crowd also swinging cricket bats they have brought along. IMRAN has developed a most original style of campaigning. He delivers one message and pauses. And loud background music breaks out,some kind of martial and shaadi-band bhangra-pop hybrid. Crowds sway with the music and,as it pauses,wait for Imran to resume. He never mentions India,rarely criticises the army,targets America and the Sharifs,and makes a real statement of courage by not hiding behind bulletproof glass shields. If anything,security at his meetings is ridiculously poor. His detractors say he obviously has nobody to fear,as he is the favoured candidate of both the army and the fundamentalists. But the chaos at his meetings is an experience. At his meeting in Nishtar Colony on Lahore<U+0092>s Ferozepur Road <U+0097> an area that would resemble,say,interior West Patel Nagar in Delhi <U+0097> scores and scores of people fight their way to his stage,jostling and pushing while climbing a swaying,creaking steel ladder. The accident,which subsequently nearly crippled him,was waiting to happen. For him,each rally is like a celebration after a World Cup victory. The hero on his crazed fans<U+0092> shoulders,each day and moment when the hero can do no wrong,say nothing wrong. So,in one breath he questions the masculinity of the Sharifs,and in the other,asks the brothers to put their hands on their hearts and say that they<U+0092>ve been faithful to their wives. As for himself,he says,of course,that he never strayed even once,the moment he was married. Of course,the music breaks out again,and the crowds go delirious savouring,perhaps,the thought of what he was up to before that,and after. Anybody can see the hype,the overstatement and the over-promising and sheer bragging. While you do have some calm moments,like him promising equality and safety to <U+0093>my Hindu,Sikh and Christian brothers<U+0094> in his speech at R-Block in Lahore<U+0092>s Model Town (the constituency has a large minority,mainly Christian,vote),it is generally the crassest,angriest,most personalised campaign,almost with shades of soft fascism,with exhortations to thrash the <U+0093>thieves and looters<U+0094>,to the swinging of bats. Whether he wins or not,Imran may be unleashing a monster on Pakistan<U+0092>s back-streets. The bat can be an effective symbol of empowerment and Imran<U+0092>s advertising makes full use of it. You see common Pakistanis in familiar day-to-day situations of harassment and helplessness,and all problems vanish or are solved the moment one of them shows a bat with <U+0093>PTI<U+0094> written on it. A driving licence is given,traffic stops at zebra strips the moment a young woman plants a PTI bat in front of it. So far so good. But what bowled me over was the one where a Pakistani walks into an embassy (presumably Western),plants his bat menacingly,and is immediately handed back his passport,its pages prominently stamped <U+0093>VISA GRANTED<U+0094> in capital letters. Yes,the PTI bat is expected to strike terror not just in the hearts of bad guys in Pakistan,but also among arrogant,evil Western powers. Imran mixes contradictory philosophies and ideas with convenient ease. He supports the fundamentalist view of Ahmediyas as apostates,speaks glowingly of Shariah law and quotes Allama Iqbal in the same vein. YOU would normally think all this would put off the liberal upper crust,particularly the English-speaking,foreign-educated youth among them. The surprise is,it doesn<U+0092>t. On the contrary,they love him. At a dinner in a Japanese restaurant,we meet a small group of the brightest young Pakistanis,among them some Ivy Leaguers,who adore Imran. They say,in fact,that within their set,it would be uncool not to support Imran. For most of them,PPP would have been the default option in the past. But Asif Ali Zardari is not BB (or Bibi,as Benazir Bhutto is usually called) and her party is now a mere discredited rabble. The Sharifs are corrupt,old-fashioned and a force of political status quo. In any case,they are much too political. Imran,on the other hand,is idealistic and patriotic in a non-ideological,even apolitical,way. Rivals quibble with Imran<U+0092>s youth leader claims. He is,after all,only a year younger than Nawaz,and four years older than Zardari. But who is checking birth certificates? To an extent,you can compare this with the sentiment you saw among the Indian upper and middle classes at the peak of the Anna movement. It was able to ride the anti-politician movement,but only briefly. Because politics in India is much too deep-rooted and durable,and a vast majority of its people far too political,seasoned through so many elections. That<U+0092>s why Anna<U+0092>s wave fizzled out and,rather than disillusion the masses further from politics,has somehow seen voting percentages rise phenomenally across the country,in a surprising reaffirmation of the political system. There are dangers in such instant theorising. But perhaps,in Pakistan,politics is not yet as deep as well as ideologically divisive,and so a new and charismatic apolitical politician draws such trust and admiration. Particularly among the educated youth and women. Or contrarily,you can see Imran as Narendra Modi in a country much less diverse than India. ONE of Imran<U+0092>s strengths,you are told,is that he allows plenty of internal democracy within his party. That is one of the reasons,says my old friend,and for long a PPP loyalist,Shafqat Mehmood,now PTI<U+0092>s candidate in the National Assembly<U+0092>s constituency number 126,which includes the most exclusive Lahore neighbourhood,like Gulberg. Shafqat started as a freelance columnist,made some fame,and then joined <U+0093>BB<U+0094> as her information secretary. Now,he says,the PPP is finished. So finished,he says,that he doesn<U+0092>t even know who the PPP candidate against him is. <U+0093>Kaun haiga,tainu pata hai? (who is it,do you know?),<U+0094> he asks a campaign manager in mock curiosity. The difference between Imran and the Bhutto-Zardaris,he says,is that you can disagree with him openly. <U+0093>Then what happens,<U+0094> I ask. <U+0093>He listens to you,<U+0094> says Shafqat. <U+0093>But does he sometimes accept your point of view,<U+0094> I ask again. <U+0093>Not necessarily,<U+0094> says Shafqat,<U+0093>but no harm comes to you because you dared to disagree.<U+0094> There are,therefore,limits to internal democracy within PTI,but it is there,and that is unusual,and a positive in Pakistan. The party has had internal elections,for example. And Imran has discarded many familiar <U+0093>electables<U+0094> in favour of fresh and unknown candidates. He is asking you to vote for him,forget the candidates. Shafqat,however,has other concerns. <U+0093>One thing he must do on coming to power,<U+0094> he says,half-seriously,<U+0093>is to ban the use of roses in election campaigns.<U+0094> Why? Because wherever you go,they greet you with rose garlands that are constantly being sprinkled with water so they stay fresh. It makes a mess of your shirts. And then they shower you with those wretched rose petals that get stuck in your hair and ruins it. Shafqat takes us along to watch one of his corner meetings in K-Block,Gulberg,and he<U+0092>s besieged with what else,but rose garlands,on arrival. And then the wretched petals. When we leave,he<U+0092>s still working to dislodge them with the finger of one hand,while holding his coiffure in place with the other. At least,now we know why he is complaining. SURPRISE of surprises,for someone running such a sharp campaign,Imran has chosen Faiz Ahmed Faiz<U+0092>s famous <U+0093>hum dekhenge (we shall see)<U+0094> as his party<U+0092>s anthem. Faiz was a communist,and the gentlest,most cultured and soft-spoken one at that. His immortal composition was both a tribute and exhortation to the <U+0093>people of god<U+0094> (khalq-e-khuda),which is both <U+0093>you and I<U+0094> (jo main bhi hun aur tum bhi ho) to throw away the yoke of dictatorship. He would surely have baulked at the thought of his most stirring political composition being used with the metaphor of a menacingly swinging bat where <U+0093>hum dekhenge<U+0094> begins to sound more like <U+0093>main tere ko dekh loonga (I shall sort you out)<U+0094>. Faiz,whose own indifference to partisan politics was summed up in his jo aaye,so aaye,hum dil khushaada rakhte hain (let anybody come to power,we have a big heart),would have taken one deep,worried puff of his cigarette and asked,hello,just whose side am I on? But how did this happen,I ask his daughter Salima Hashmi,dean at the school of visual arts at Beaconhouse National University,who runs a pretty art gallery in her old Model Town home,mainly to help new artists display,and by a remarkable quirk of fate,has also been nominated health minister in the caretaker Punjab cabinet and is feeling rotten about a Pakhtun child who died of measles. All the parties had asked her for the rights to <U+0093>hum dekhenge<U+0094>,she said,and asked her to name the price. She said she wouldn<U+0092>t give it for anybody<U+0092>s millions,but offer it free if the Communist Party wanted it. But Pakistan hasn<U+0092>t had a communist party for very long,and that<U+0092>s a tale I save up for a bit later. In this case,it just so happened that <U+0093>this silly nephew of mine joined the PTI and told them they could start using the composition<U+0094>. It was too late for her to do anything about it. And now the story about Pakistan<U+0092>s communists from a very <U+0093>spirited<U+0094> May Day evening in Lahore,1990. It was another of those periods when India and Pakistan seemed headed for war,and Benazir had taken the rhetoric to another level by promising to chop Jagmohan,then governor of Kashmir,into <U+0093>jag-jag,mo-mo,han-han<U+0094>,and Prime Minister V.P. Singh had asked tauntingly if those who talked of a thousand-year war could even last a thousand hours. I was in Pakistan,then,pursuing that story. In the morning,I,so utterly a reactionary,was drawn into attending my first May Day rally,albeit a kalam-mazdoor (intellectuals<U+0092>) gathering,at Pak Tea House,a liberal creative hangout. In the evening,some of us gravitated to dinner in a home by the canal,where the star was Eqbal Ahmad sahib,the nicest,warmest and most fun revolutionary ever. He had fought,by the way,with the Algerians and Palestinians,and was indicted for an attempted abduction of Henry Kissinger; the court later admitted it was a mistrial. After polishing off a lot of Black Label,it seemed,by 2 am,that we had resolved most of our problems,particularly Kashmir. As I was leaving,he first held my hand and said,young man,I am told you are a very good reporter with a great understanding of Pakistan politics,so let me give you a word of caution. <U+0093>Tell me,sir,<U+0094> I asked. <U+0093>You see,the view you heard here was the view of Pakistan<U+0092>s left. I don<U+0092>t want you to make the mistake of thinking this is the view of anybody who matters in Pakistan.<U+0094> <U+0093>Why do you say so,sir?<U+0094> I asked. <U+0093>Because Pakistan has only nine communists left and all of them are here at this dinner,<U+0094> he said. <U+0093>And soon,beta,when I<U+0092>ll be gone,there will be eight left.<U+0094> He died several years later,in 1999,and was buried in Islamabad,and Salima Hashmi remembers it was a rare funeral in Pakistan<U+0092>s history,where women stood shoulder-to-shoulder with men. I remind Salima of that conversation. And she laughs,more in delight than in regret. She is a most illustrious literary leftist<U+0092>s daughter,after all. And is happy to live by his brilliantly renunciatory view of his own life: kuchch ishq kiya,kuchch kaam kiya.

Can you also read what is going on in Pakistani voters<U+0092> minds by reading the writings on their walls,particularly when you are visiting that country after a full 11 years? And finally,can you do it when you cannot recognise a letter of Urdu? You don<U+0092>t have to try so hard. Really. Nor do you have to look that far. Look out of your car window,walking around the street corners,the busy,typically subcontinental back-lanes of Lahore that could be a slice of West Delhi but for the donkey-carts and Urdu signage,the tri-junction where you turn for Raiwind,now famous for Mian Nawaz Sharif<U+0092>s 1,000-acre farmhouse,and most of the English acronyms on the walls would look familiar to you: BA,MSc,MBA and,somewhat less familiar,FA,the intermediate equivalent degree that used to be popular in northern India as well during our parents<U+0092> times. So that,you would say,is not particularly different from India. But what is this other three-letter acronym,U.P.S. that stares at you from wherever you look? From the walls,poles,billboards nailed to trees,village bazaars,the rears of buses,auto-rickshaws,even horse-carts? For a while,you even lazily presume it is some kind of a professional degree that is popular in Pakistan. BUT not for long. Because you attend your first election meeting,or talk to any Pakistani and ask what the major issues in this election are,and the meaning of those three letters unravels. The main issue,in fact,for many the only issue in this election,is power. As in electricity. Most of Pakistan,even the big cities,has load-shedding for 16-18 hours. And U.P.S. stands for the humble Uninterrupted Power Supply system,what we prefer to call inverter in India. It is today the hottest selling item in Pakistan and has spawned an entire cottage industry in manufacture and repair,as stark an example of broken-window economics as you have seen. Anybody you talk to,from the most prominent industrialist to your car driver,can hold forth on Pakistan<U+0092>s power problems. That no new dams have been built in decades,in fact none after Mangla and Tarbela <U+0097> and they don<U+0092>t even have a Medha Patkar. Most of the thermal power is fuelled by gas (now scarce) or furnace oil (too expensive). Government mandates low prices for most consumers,so utilities have gone bankrupt. A prominent Independent Power Plant (IPP) owner in Lahore tells us he is not being paid,so,like others,he has also shut his plant down. Sounds familiar? Except that Pakistan has not even carried out the reform India has,particularly during the past six months or so. And at least for now,Pakistan produces almost no coal. Peak hour shortages,therefore,are higher than in any part of India,even though rural electrification is more extensive in Pakistan,if you leave out the more distant tribal areas. As a consequence,power shortages diminish the quality of life of a much larger percentage of the population. And why does a country supposed to be so well endowed with natural gas,have power plants starving for it? Once again,because of energy price distortions. The price of diesel,petrol and even kerosene in Pakistan has been raised to commercially remunerative levels,Pakistani rupees 106,98 and 98.2,respectively (100 Pakistani rupees equal 54 of India<U+0092>s). While Pakistan has been brave enough to price diesel above petrol and take away all kerosene subsidy,it has,instead,heavily subsidised CNG in the belief that it was produced at home. Households have it on tap,and up to 70 per cent of the cars run on it. So the really poor pay the full price for kerosene,the really rich or upper middle class ride on subsidised gas. The power plants,meanwhile,remain idle. Both the major contestants,Nawaz Sharif (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) and Imran Khan (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf),promise to fix the power problem within three years. Nobody is convinced. But everybody blames five years of Asif Ali Zardari for it. That<U+0092>s why you do not even list him and his Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) among the major contestants. Its rout is written on the walls,in those three deathly letters: U.P.S. POWER crisis has become such an overwhelming symbol of misgovernance,it has put other vital issues in the shade. No India,no Kashmir,no Sarabjit-Sanaullah,no army,some terrorism,and a bit more of America. Nobody speaks for terrorism,but nobody promises to fight it. Everybody curses America and promises to pull away from its <U+0093>war on terror<U+0094>. And in an utterly non-level playing field,campaigning has mostly shifted to television screens. You surf through Pakistan<U+0092>s 60-odd TV channels and all you watch is paid-for political content,and labelled as such. This applies particularly to the three parties whom the Pakistani Taliban and other extremists have declared <U+0093>secular<U+0094>,and therefore they dare not even step out in the open. In the Frontier,old Khan Wali Khan<U+0092>s once famous and brave Red Shirts are now indoors and have yet lost more than a hundred to terror attacks. In Karachi,nobody has dared to hold a rally for several days now and its leading Mohajir party,MQM,campaigns on TV and through videoconferences,its supremo Altaf Hussain exiled in London for more than two decades,too scared to even visit Karachi. The kidnapping,this Thursday,of former prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani<U+0092>s son from an election rally is just the most telling instance of how the PPP has been targeted by the same terrorists. Except,maybe,in some strongholds of interior Sindh,it is totally shut out of the campaign. It has taken refuge in television and the channel owners,who had anticipated this and upped their tariffs,are not complaining. No wonder the face you see most often is that of a very defiant,angry,and I am sorry to say,terrified-sounding Bilawal Zardari screaming to offer his head,blood,life,anything,<U+0093>kyonki yeh khoon ki ladayi hai<U+0094>. But he hasn<U+0092>t yet been seen in public. And after the Gilani kidnapping,there is no chance he would,over the weekend,either. The ruling party is right to complain that terrorists have pretty much driven them out of the contest. But even if they hadn<U+0092>t,you can<U+0092>t see how their message would have impressed Pakistan of today. Invoking the name and old speeches of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto promising to give his life for Pakistan may fire the old faithful,but they will have to be very old indeed. Because,like India,Pakistan is a young population and while a reliable census hasn<U+0092>t been held for a very long time,you can safely say that nearly 80 per cent of the voters today would have been born after Bhutto<U+0092>s execution. Bhutto<U+0092>s name,as well as the assassination/sacrifice metaphor,are both dated. The ruling party is,therefore,truly orphaned. It<U+0092>s missing Benazir<U+0092>s spunk,her husband and legatee is out of the campaign too,preferring the safety of titular presidency to the mortal dangers of this campaign. Several other leading lights have defected,mostly to Imran Khan<U+0092>s PTI. THE absence of Benazir and her PPP has made it a two-party contest,or a fight between two personalities whom you could aptly describe <U+0097> with some licence,of course <U+0097> as Loins of Punjab. Both Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan speak the language befitting full-blooded,pucca Punjabis. But for the <U+0093>Loin<U+0094> metaphor,greater credit must go to the Sharifs,whose election symbol is the tiger <U+0097> though in its posters and billboards it has been caricatured as some kind of a character from ancient Babylonian art,with the striped body of a tiger and the face more like that of a cow. His campaigners parade live tigers through city streets,drive them on trailers on rural roads. In Lahore this Monday,it was followed by a live band and turbaned singer Nasir Beraj,seeking votes to the tune of a tappy Tanu Weds Manu number <U+0093>kadi saadi gali mud ke vi aaya karo<U+0094> (moharan sher utte atth-atth laya karo). Excited crowds follow them screaming with perverse delight,oye sher,oye sher,poking the poor animal with sticks,throwing pebbles,even little pieces of meat,sometimes teasing it,sometimes cajoling it,as if it was a pet dog. And if the desperate,angry,hungry,thirsty,panicky and often heat-struck tiger even growls in protest,there are howls of joy. Your day is made. <U+0093>Don<U+0092>t poke the tiger,<U+0094> I risk trying to reason with one breathless,lumpen. Not yet willing to accept the futility of trying to teach instant zoology to a mob of excited Lahoris,I point to the animal<U+0092>s stripes to argue why it is a tiger. <U+0093>Oye sher hai,disda nahin tainu,<U+0094> (it is a lion,can<U+0092>t you see?) <U+0093>sher hai,sher,LOIN,bÖÖ.d.<U+0094> I retreat at this point. One of the tigers used in the campaign died of exhaustion this Wednesday,poked,harassed,starved,terrorised and dehydrated,I presume,and not particularly because they said rude things about its sister. You see the lions (not tigers) at the entrance of the Sharif family living room at Raiwind. The very impressive stuffed animals have been imported from Zimbabwe,and you see more stuffed animals as you look around,deer of several kinds,fox and then live,exotic birds,including peacocks,in various colours. I am seeing Nawaz Sharif after almost seven years,although our friendship <U+0097> and I use that expression seriously,and also as a disclosure <U+0097> goes back a quarter century. He has put on some weight lately. But he also talks more like a liberal politician than he did in the past. He reminds me of a conversation we once had on how a society and its leaders had to pay their dues to earn the blessing of real democracy,and how it was often done by going to jail. Nawaz Sharif has done more than that. Fourteen months in terrible confinement,and then six years in exile. The good thing is,he learnt the right lessons from that experience,the first of them being that to keep the army out,he had to reach out to fellow politicians,particularly his rivals. He has helped his arch enemy PPP last its full term,knowing the symbolic and substantive effect it would have in a country where elected governments have traditionally been treated as interregnums between military rule,and where each coup has succeeded,without even a bullet having to be fired. He says he wants to move on now,but will he forgive Pervez Musharraf? Not for subverting Pakistan<U+0092>s constitution,for destroying its still incipient institutions. And then he talks with a sense of pain <U+0097> and anger <U+0097> about how he was treated in captivity. How he was taken from Rawalpindi in a propeller-driven aircraft that took seven hours reaching Karachi after refuelling in Multan,while he sat handcuffed to the seat through the journey. But he senses power in his grasp now and,like many other traditional politicians (a change in the mostly feudal,winner-takes-all Pakistan of the past),he is willing to forget and move on. But he has one problem nagging him now,a man called Imran Khan. So far,he had thought he was going to sweep Punjab,maybe bag more than a hundred of its 148 seats (out of a total National Assembly strength of 342). His party has done a stellar job with infrastructure in Punjab,particularly in Lahore. A 29-km bus rapid corridor has been set up in a mere 10 months. Lakhs ride it every day and bless the Sharifs for it. Unlike the botched up BRT of New Delhi,ruined by nitwit ideological fantasies of denying road space to cars,this is an uncluttered infrastructural idea. Where possible,the road has been expanded to make fenced lanes in the middle. Elsewhere,for a full 9 km,the corridor has been elevated,and all in 10 months. Dozens of new underpasses,ring roads and flyovers have transformed the city. If there is one thing the Sharifs are known for,it is execution. Therefore it is their claims on fixing the power situation that people are most likely to find convincing. Further,his traditional rival,PPP,was missing,the religious parties were either with him or discredited. And Imran Khan was more like a side-show,a bit of an irritant or entertainment,depending on how you looked at him. But that has changed lately. Which is why,this early morning,as we chew our deep-fried shrimp and chicken,his war council is already assembling in his living room. Tariq Azeem Khan,a prominent veteran politician (now senator) and his key advisor,is joined by his former principal secretary and Tariq Fatemi,a former ambassador. His brother Shahbaz (less than two years younger than him),the chief minister of Punjab,joins in and then follows daughter Maryam,the latest and most persuasive young entrant in his campaign. There is some talk around Imran and,while working furiously on her smartphone,she jokes about her uncle<U+0092>s latest slogan,<U+0093>utte Allah,nichche balla,tey Imran reh gaya kalla. (Allah in his heaven,the cricket bat <U+0097> PTI<U+0092>s election symbol <U+0097> on the earth,and Imran left to fend for himself.)<U+0094> But there is concern in the air. There is some talk around Imran<U+0092>s rallies. And while some of the participants say they are flops,there is a screen being set up behind the sofas for a PowerPoint presentation on further strategy. The only concern,it is said,is that Imran is making very good use of electronic media. The presentation,you<U+0092>d presume,is on how to counter that. Midway through a campaign that had looked like a one-horse,or rather a one-sher race,it seems the Sharifs have something to worry about.

779,"Germany's head coach Markus Weiss says that rigour of playing match after match with little time for training and even less for rest hurts players. Need to deal with our military past with genuine scholarship, not jingoism ó like this new book on 1971. On a flight back home Friday morning, as I was lost reading Eagles Over Bangladesh (HarperCollins, 2013), P.V.S. Jagan Mohan and Samir Chopraís brilliantly researched and reconstructed history of the air war in the eastern sector in 1971, an old friend sitting next to me asked why I was so fascinated with military history. Funnily, I had been asked the same question recently by a prominent young national political leader on the sidelines of a wedding. His question, in fact, was sharper, maybe because he is so much younger: ìWhy are you so obsessed with war?î I said military history was indeed a fad with some. But he had made me think harder and I said that in the Indian context, it wasnít wars that fascinated me, it was the decade of the Sixties. In so many ways, this rocky decade defined the new Indian republic. There were half a dozen reasons and an equal number of occasions when India could have broken up or lost its identity. Certainly, the remarkably secure and united India that we live in today was then unimaginable. Some of these reasons were internal secessionist movements, from the Tamils (the DMK was as separatist as it was iconoclastic) to the northeastern tribes, and then the death of two popular prime ministers (Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri) while in office. But the 1960s was also Indiaís decade of wars. It started with the Goa campaign in December 1961. Celebrations were not yet over when the Chinese stormed across the Himalayas in 1962. That led to Nehruís sad, lonely and defeated decline. But it also rid Indiaís defence forces of a curse called Krishna Menon and created a national consensus for stronger militaries. This was a work in progress when Pakistan first successfully probed our vulnerabilities in Kutch in 1965 and, encouraged, launched a large invasion of Kashmir later the same year, resulting in our first full-scale war in September, involving all three forces. All three were caught, sort of half-cocked, in the middle of a massive expansion and modernisation, but achieved a reasonable stalemate.

780,"Profit for the three months ended December fell to Rs 88.5 crore from Rs 98.8 crore in the year-earlier period, Mindtree, whose customers include Microsoft and Volvo AB, said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday. Profit excluding foreign exchange loss was Rs 116 crore. ""We are seeing good business momentum and traction with our clients,"" CEO Krishnakumar Natarajan said in the statement. Mindtree had a strong deal pipeline, Natarajan added. Sales in dollar terms rose to $127.1 million, a 2.5 percent increase over the previous quarter, in line with analysts expectations. Despite large IT services firms like Infosys and HCL tech having reported a better-than-expected result riding on market and demand recovery, analysts expected mid-tier IT firm Mindtree to report moderate growth of 2.5% -3% and a decline in the margins for the third quarter. According to analysts, Mindtree was expected to face weak seasonality and currency impact that would lead to slower growth compared to previous two quarters. ""MindTree's revenue growth should slow on seasonality,"" said Kuldeep Kaul, equity analyst at ICICI Securities in a note to the clients. Kaul expected Mindtree's December quarter growth to slow to around 3% sequentially, compared with the 5.4% and 4.1% growth as reported in the prior two quarters. However, given the strong deal momentum analysts expect it to perform better in the coming fiscal year that ends March 2015. ""We model revenue growth of 15.2% in FY14 and 17% in FY15,"" Kaul added. During the third quarter ended December 31, 2013, the company announced wage hikes to almost 20% of its senior employees, and according to analyst estimates, this could impact the profitability. Also factoring in lateral hiring announcements, margins could suffer by 100-150 basis points. ""Margins will decline due to wage compensation revision, fresh hiring and volume weakness due to seasonality,"" Mumbai brokerage Kotak Institutional equities had said in a note ahead of the results.

781,"Germany's head coach Markus Weiss says that rigour of playing match after match with little time for training and even less for rest hurts players. Addressing the nation for the first time from the ramparts of Delhiís Red Fort, on August 15, 2004, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared, playing on Robert Frostís lines, ìToday, I have no promises to make, but I have promises to keep.î The reference being to the fact that his agenda in office would be defined by the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) arrived at between the constituents of the coalition he headed. It is not a secret that almost every important policy initiative taken by the first United Progressive Alliance government (UPA 1), save the nuclear deal, was embedded in the NCMP. The historic India-US agreement for cooperation in the development of civil nuclear energy, and the subsequent end to what Singh has called ìthe nuclear apartheidî against India by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), that normalised and ìlegitimisedî Indiaís status as a nuclear weapons power, was Singhís own promise to the country that he finally kept. The nuclear deal was not an NCMP commitment because it was only after Singh took charge as PM that he discovered that his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had initiated an important dialogue with President George W. Bush of the United States towards this end. When the deed was finally done, Singh told Vajpayee, as the two stood alone at Singhís official residence, ìI have completed what you began.î It is not, therefore, surprising that when Prime Minister Singh was asked, at last weekís press conference in New Delhi, what he thought was the ìhigh pointî of his decade in office, he promptly said, ìthe best moment for me was when we were able to strike a nuclear deal with the United States to end the nuclear apartheid, which had sought to stifle the processes of social and economic change and technical progress of our country in many ways.î That was indeed his personal achievement in office. The rest being the product of the UPAís jointly adopted NCMP. Two criticisms have been levelled against Singh for claiming that getting the nuclear deal through was his ìbest momentî. The first criticism has come from the supporters of the UPA government who wonder why the PM mentioned the nuclear deal rather than any of the important ìrightsî legislated by the government. The right to employment, information, education and food, claim these critics, ought to have figured higher on the PMís list. The second criticism has come from the UPAís opponents who claim the nuclear deal was just a ìdudî and has not added a single megawatt of nuclear power to the countryís power generation capacity. The second criticism is easily answered with facts. Indiaís nuclear power generation was going down month after month in the early 2000s with a decline in the availability of the required fuel. Indiaís domestic production of uranium was not meeting the requirements of the nuclear power sector and imports were constrained by international restrictions. What the nuclear deal did was to remove the external constraint. Having entered into the 123 agreement with India, the Bush administration lobbied with member countries of the NSG, including a recalcitrant China, to lift the restrictions on the supply of nuclear fuel to India. The capacity utilisation at Indiaís existing nuclear power plants has gone up from as low as 30 per cent in the months preceding the deal to over 80 per cent. Indiaís access to global supply of nuclear fuel is a concrete benefit of the nuclear deal. So, the deal was no ìdudî. It is true that plans for new nuclear power plants have not come to fruition, but that has to do both with the increased global risk aversion to nuclear energy after the Fukushima tragedy and to international concerns about Indiaís nuclear liability law. The second UPA government (UPA 2) was unable to get through Parliament the original draft of the liability law it wanted, which would have met international standards and expectations and kept costs lower. Instead, it succumbed to opposition pressure and brought forward an amended law that has been criticised by all nuclear power plant suppliers, including the Russians, French and Japanese, not to mention the Americans, and has raised the cost of nuclear power. For Indiaís civil nuclear power programme to move forward, the government has to rework or reinterpret its liability law. UPA 2 has been incapable of this. Only a future government can address the problem. The response to the first criticism would be that, at the press conference, the PM was asked what was the ìbest moment for himî (emphasis added) in his decade in office. Implementing the various promises of the NCMP would have given satisfaction to all the constituents of the UPA. But the nuclear deal was ìhisî personal initiative, for which he risked the survival of his government. To have been able to deliver on that promise would naturally constitute a moment of personal triumph. Here again, the opposition has claimed that the deal was finally done after Singh secured a ìtaintedî victory in the July 2008 vote of confidence. The facts about that victory, when revealed, will absolve Singh of that charge. Aware that he would in fact secure a majority, various political actors may have decided to ìtaintî it by staging the ìvotes-for-cashî scam. But that is a different story. The fact is that a significant majority of public opinion backed Singhís tough stance against the CPM hardliners, they saw his resolve as being in the national interest, they liked the fact that the prime minister of the country was standing up for something and was willing to go down fighting, and they rewarded him a year later with a handsome victory in the general elections. Singh, the media declared in one voice, ìis kingî! If Singh did not view the nuclear deal as the high point of his decade in office, what else could he?

He joined the Indian Express as a cub reporter at its Chandigarh edition in 1977. Three years later, at just 23, The Indian Express sent him to Indiaís troubled north-east where he covered the then raging insurgencies and civil unrest. As a reporter, and then an editor, with India Today, Shekhar has always brought to readers in India a ringside view of contemporary history from Operation Bluestar to the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the student uprising in Tiananmen Square in Beijing to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first Gulf War from Baghdad, Jerusalem and Kuwait, the first ìjihadî in Afghanistan and the many twists & turns in the troubled 1983-1993 decade in Sri Lankaís Tamil North. Shekhar uncovered LTTE training camps in India, the truth behind the falsely implicated scientists of the Indian Space Research Organisation in a spy scandal. And seven years before the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, he travelled across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany, the US and the UK, to report extensively on the threat from pan-national fundamentalism, including its links with Osama bin Laden. Shekharís weekly column called National Interest is one of the most credible and independent voices in the media. It is a touchstone for new ideas in politics, governance, society, business and sports. He also hosts an interview-based programme Walk the Talk on NDTV 24x7. A regular guest speaker at prestigious forums including the Asia Society, New York, National Defense College and Defense Services Staff College and the World Economic Forum in Davos and its India summits, Shekhar has authored Assam: A Valley Divided and India Redefines Its Role , published by the Oxford University Press and by the International Institute of Strategic Studies, London, where he is a member of the Council. Over the years he has engaged as one of the pre-eminent voices from India on issues ranging from domestic politics and society to security and international affairs. Shekhar is the recipient of several awards and honours, including the 1985 Inlaks award for young journalist of the year, G K Reddy Award for Journalism, the Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Memorial Award for National Integration.

783,"Germany's head coach Markus Weiss says that rigour of playing match after match with little time for training and even less for rest hurts players. The Aam Aadmi Partyís controversial foray into Kashmir affairs and the BJPís continuing attacks on the UPA governmentís foreign policy last week do not bode well for Indiaís national security at a critical moment in domestic politics and great uncertainty in the international environment. The call for a referendum in Kashmir on the presence of the army there by Prashant Bhushan, a senior leader of the AAP, shows how unready the party is for the big stage. The problem is not that Bhushan has his foot in his mouth. After all, this is not the first time he has stirred up a controversy on Kashmir. In 2011, he had reportedly suggested that a plebiscite should decide whether Kashmir should be part of India. The worry is about the partyís facile understanding of the national security challenges in Kashmir. The army has been deployed in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s for a specific reason ó to cope with the extraordinary threat to the nationís territorial integrity accentuated by cross-border terrorism aided by the Pakistan army. The AAP seems to forget that J&Kís accession to the Union of India is contested by Pakistan and parts of this frontier state are under the occupation of Pakistan and China. Yet, it is not out of place for a political party to raise questions about the nature, disposition, and effectiveness of the armyís large scale deployment in Kashmir for nearly a quarter of a century. Instead of responsibly initiating what could have been a useful national debate, however, the AAP has raised a highly sensitive issue in a cavalier manner. As a new political formation that has captured the nationís imagination in a short span of time, the AAP might be excused for its innocence on national security. The BJP, in power during 1998-2004, has no such redeeming explanation for its churlish attitude towards national security. Consider, for example, the partyís reaction to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhís comments on the foreign policy record of the UPA government at a press conference last Friday. The BJPís criticism of the PMís statement that India was in sight of a breakthrough with Pakistan and its questioning of the terms of the UPAís Kashmir negotiations with Islamabad are breathtaking in their cynicism. It is well known that Atal Bihari Vajpayee authorised negotiations with Pakistan on Kashmir, for the first time since 1963, through a back channel, immediately after the NDA came to power in 1998. Interlocutors on the Pakistani side have affirmed that these discussions took place on the basis of the so-called ìChenab formulaî that would have involved some territorial concessions. The veteran journalist, Kuldip Nayar, reported in his book, Scoop (published in 2006), that Vajpayee had told him India and Pakistan ìwere almost thereî in clinching a Kashmir settlement during 1998-99. Pakistanís Kargil betrayal in 1999 and the failed Agra Summit with Pervez Musharraf in 2001 did not stop Vajpayee, who understood the utmost imp.",Degrees of irresponsibility | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/degrees-of-irresponsibility/

To clarify doubts about the contentious ëretrospective clauseí in the new Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Act, 2013, and prevent possible abuse, the government is set to issue clarifications in the form of an advisory, based on opinion of Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran. The Act was passed by Parliament last year and was notified on January 1 this year. Under the new Act, the retrospective clause would apply to any acquisition where no awards have been made or where awards have been made five years or more before commencement of the new Act but no compensation has been paid or possession taken. According to officials of the Ministry of Rural Development, it was felt this section of the Act could be misused and hence clarity was needed on its operation and interpretation. For this, the ministry sought Parasaranís opinion based on which it is in the process of issuing an advisory. According to the draft advisory, retrospective operation of the Act would have deemed to have come into effect from the day the Act came into force, January 1. Further, ëphysical possessioní would have been considered to have been taken when land acquired had been ìphysically demarcated and effective physical and absolute control taken within five years of the award.î In terms of interpretation of the five year period, the ministry clarified that in cases where compensation has not been accepted or physical possession not given for a period less than five years, then the new law will apply only if pendency continues unchanged for five or more years. Further, in cases where compensation has not been paid or possession not taken because the acquisition process has been challenged in court, then the period spent under litigation would also be taken into account to determine the five-year period.†Parasaran, in his opinion, however, added the ministry should clarify that this would apply only in cases where awards have been passed under the old Act five or more years before January 1, 2014.",Govt to issue norms for ëretrospective clauseí in Land Act  | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/govt-to-issue-norms-for-retrospective-clause-in-land-act/

Marking a generational shift in state politics, Union Minister Sachin Pilot was Monday appointed the Congress chief in Rajasthan where the party faced a rout in Assembly polls, while Arun Yadav was named Congress chief in Madhya Pradesh, another state where Congress suffered a considerable defeat. The 36-year-old Minister for Corporate Affairs is a close associate of party Vice President Rahul Gandhi and is the son of late Union Minister Rajesh Pilot and Rama Pilot, who was also MP for a term. He replaces incumbent Chandrabhan, who was defeated in the Assembly polls. Arun Yadav, 39, represents the Khargone constituency in MP.

Twenty-three years on,these 115 teachers,recruited with the help of the Urdu Academy,are still working on a contractual basis. Earlier this year,the government had announced that 100 new teachers will be added to Urdu medium schools in Delhi under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) as well as in schools where Urdu was taught as a second language. The figure was later revised to 200. But they are yet to be recruited. Speaking to Newsline,Education Minister Kiran Walia said a fresh notification will be issued soon by the government which will <U+0093>exempt teachers from the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET)<U+0094>. The qualification certificate is a key requirement in the appointment of these teachers as they are being recruited under the SSA scheme of the Central government. Professor Akhtarul Wasey,vice-chairman of the Urdu Academy,said owing to the dismal performance of many in CTET,finding teachers has been difficult even for Urdu medium schools. The Urdu teachers are being trained by IASE,faculty of education,JMI,so that they can be employed in schools. Wasey wrote to the Delhi government in July 2013 raising concerns over the acute shortage of Urdu medium teachers in the city. He said <U+0093>either Urdu schools are without teachers or the job is entrusted to non-Urdu teachers.<U+0094> In his letter,he also quoted the percentage of those qualifying the CTET last year as merely two per cent. The Urdu Academy had demanded that whenever CTET teachers are available,they may be considered on a priority basis. However,if such teachers are not available,then teachers with BEd or elementary teachers<U+0092> training may be considered for appointment.

As the diktat drew criticism from various quarters,the AMU authorities last night withdrew the circular while clarifying that it ìnever even remotely suggested that jeans or T-shirts or any other dress is on the ban list at AMUî. ìWe have no intention whatsoever of specifying any dress code and neither did the above circular do so. All that we have sought is that students including girls should be in a decent attire which reflects the ethos of our society. ìIn any case the above circular was issued not by top university administration but the provost of one of the halls of residence,î said Brigadier (Retd) S Ahmad Ali,AMUís Pro-Vice Chancellor,who is holding charge as the acting VC in the absence of Lt Gen Shah. The students had been told that they can keep only one mobile phone whose number is known to their parents <U+0097> because,according to the university authorities,many students use their phones to speak to boyfriends on the sly. The women had also been told that they cannot visit cinemas,restaurants and hotels. The restrictions had been put up on the noticeboards of the six hostels that make up Abdullah Hall,and in which nearly 1,300 students of AMU<U+0092>s Women<U+0092>s College stay. Ali said there are five halls of residence for girls in AMU and one out of these had issued an advisory mainly dealing with rules and regulations including the compulsory presentation of ID cards while entering the girlsí hostels. ìThe above circular was issued by the Provost of Abdullah Hall and not by any senior university official. Even then,we have asked the provost to withdraw the above circular so as to remove even an iota of doubt regarding the sincerity of our intentions,î he said. Ali also refuted media reports claiming that use of Internet and social networking websites was banned in the universityís hostels. ìI was quite shocked to read media reports alleging that we have banned the use of Internet and social media for girls. This is a total fabrication as in fact we are in the process of implementing a project under which every student of the university who resides in the hostel including girls will have a direct access to the Internet facilities in their rooms,î he added. ìThere is no question of our trying to impose any retrograde ban,î he said. Ali also added,îever since a new administration assumed charge at AMU about a year back,we are leaving no stone unturned to modernise and revitalise the entire edifice of this historic institution. He said during the first year,the main effort was to get rid of all unlawful and mischievous elements who had in the past brought a bad name to this institution. ìWe are also moving on the fast track for upgrading and modernising the academic system to take this institution to the very top in the country. During this process,we appear to have stepped on many toes and perhaps we have to pay the price for having disturbed the vested interests,î he said. In April,AMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen. (retd) Zameeruddin Shah had,in an open letter to students,instructed male students to wear sherwanis when they came to meet him. The university had also asked women students to <U+0093>dress according to the customs and traditions<U+0094> of AMU. Women students who do not abide by the new restrictions would be fined Rs 500,the notice had said. Residents of Abdullah Hall are allowed to go out to shop or meet their guardians on Fridays and Sundays. They may have male visitors on designated days,but cannot bring them inside the hostels. Even before the new ban on visiting cinemas and restaurants,Aligarh<U+0092>s main market,Centre Point,situated down the road from Abdullah Hall,was out of bounds for the women. Abdullah Hall provost Dr Ghazala Parveen had said she was not conservative,and the restrictions were <U+0093>precautions<U+0094> against <U+0093>indecent incidents<U+0094>. <U+0093>It is all precautionary measures. The dress code is indicative; outside the hall,they can wear anything,but not inside. But they should be properly and decently dressed. I am a liberal and have no problem with the dress code but then they need to give an undertaking that if any indecent incident happens,I will not be held responsible,<U+0094> Dr Parveen had said. She said the restrictions on going to movie halls or restaurants were in place last year too. The provost said the ban on more than one mobile phone was to prevent hostel residents from speaking to their boyfriends,and if any student wished to have a <U+0093>lavish<U+0094> lifestyle,she would have to leave. <U+0093>I have ample proof when they had another phone whose number was not in our records,they used it to talk with their boyfriends.

Demanding a four per cent relaxation in cut-off marks for admission in Delhi University for students passing Class XII exam from city schools,Delhi BJP today slammed the Sheila Dikshit government for ìdoing nothingî in the last 14 years to address the problem of shortage of colleges in the city. Delhi BJP president Vijay Goel said around 54,000 seats for undergraduate courses are available in Delhi University colleges annually,out of which,only 30 per cent seats go to students passing out from Delhi schools. Addressing a studentsí gathering at Viveknanda Mahila College in East Delhi,Goel said a whopping 1.3 lakh students clear class XII exam annually from schools in Delhi and most of them are left in lurch as they do not get admission in Delhi University colleges. Holding Delhi Government responsible for the situation,he said not a single college has been set up by it in the last 14 years. ìThere are 54,000 seats available in DU colleges for undergraduate courses. During the last 15 years,not even a single college has been opened by the Congress government while the number of students passing out from Class XII in Delhi schools is no less than 1.3 lakh,î Goel said and claimed that all 28 Delhi government run colleges have been opened by the BJP government. The BJP leader demanded a four per cent relaxation in cut off marks for students passing class XII exam from Delhi schools and announced that partyís youth wing Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha will spearhead a campaign to press for it. In reflection of tough competition in getting admission in Delhi University colleges,the Ram Lal Anand College last month had declared a 100 per cent marks in its first cut off list for admission in its BTech in Computer Science course.

There is a huge gap in number of students passing out class XII and the number of seats taken by these students in DU. Most of them are left in lurch. ìA 4 per cent relaxation in cut off marks for the students from Delhi will help more students from the city to get admission,î Goel said. ìThe only way to reduce the gap is to increase the number of colleges substantially,start evening classes in morning colleges and open branches/chapters of prestigious colleges in DU in the surrounding areas of Delhi so that students applying from other states in the DU may not have to come all the way here. ìThis would also help increase available seats in DU for Delhi students,î he added. Underlining the need for adequate focus on issues concerning the youths,he said BJP would try to channelise the power of youngsters to make Delhi a better city. ìWe understand the importance of youth power and would like to channelise their raw energy into making Delhi a better and safer city. ìBut for that,we need to address some issues concerning them,primary being,the issue of higher education at affordable fees within the city,î Goel added. ìTo deal with issues concerning youth holistically,the Delhi BJP has already issued an agenda for the youth in the Capital and it is committed to implement it,î he said. Addressing the gathering,Delhi BJYM President Guarav Khari said,îThe youth of Delhi have to suffer because of inaction of the Congress government.

Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade has asked a court here to dismiss the indictment against her and terminate any ìopenî arrest†warrants in visa fraud case, arguing that she was ìcloakedî in diplomatic immunity and cannot face criminal prosecution in the US. Khobragadeís lawyer Daniel Arshack yesterday filed a memorandum of law on her behalf in the Southern District of New York in support of the†motion to dismiss the case and terminate any future legal action against her ìon grounds of diplomatic immunity.î ìDr Khobragade now formally moves this Court to dismiss the instant proceeding, to rescind the conditions of her release, and eliminate her bail conditions as†she is immune from criminal prosecution in the United States as she was obligated, by the United States government, to leave the jurisdiction,î Arshack said in the†filing. Arshack is seeking a court order to dismiss the indictment and proceeding against the Indian diplomat, terminate any and all conditions of bail previously†imposed by the court during Khobragadeís initial appearance on December 12 and exonerate any bail or bond previously posted on her behalf. The motion is also†seeking termination of any ìopen arrest warrantsî against Khobragade or ìrequests for extraditionî with regard to the case as ìthey too are nullities since the instant†proceeding is subject to dismissal.î ìI make this affirmation in support of Khobragadeís motion to dismiss the instant proceeding as a nullity because both at the time of her arrest, as well as at†the time of her subsequent indictment, defendant was cloaked in diplomatic immunity and has absolute immunity from any criminal prosecution in the United States,î he†said. Arshack is seeking a ruling on the order by Judge Shira Scheindlin on or before January 31. The office of Manhattanís top federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, who†brought the criminal charges and indictment against Khobragade said they have ìno comment at this timeî on the motion filed by Arshack. The filing states that because of Khobragadeís diplomatic status, the court did not have personal jurisdiction over her at the time of her arrest and†indictment, but it still has subject matter jurisdiction to rule over her motion to dismiss the case. Arshack argued that conditions of Khobragadeís post-arrest release and the USD 250,000 bond must be†rescinded as those restrictions on 39-year-old diplomatís liberty do not apply since she is ìabsolutely immune from criminal prosecutionî being a diplomat. He also sought ìprompt returnî of Khobragadeís passport. The motion informed the court that Khobragade had full diplomatic immunity at the time of her December 12 arrest since she had been appointed a Special Advisor†to the United Nations in August last year during the Indian Prime Ministerís visit for the UN General Assembly session. ìObviously, the Government knew when it obtained that indictment that there could be no prosecution of Khobragade since her diplomatic status had already been†changed and she was therefore immune from prosecution,î Arshack said adding that it was due to her diplomatic status that Khobragade did not get arraigned on the†indictment. Arshack said Khobragadeís immunity ìshould have preventedî her arrest, handcuffing, jailing, strip searching and imposition of bail conditions. ìThis proceeding has been wrongfully commenced against Khobragade. She should not have been arrested in the first place and she was indicted despite the fact†that the government knew that her diplomatic status precluded a prosecution of Khobragade.î Arshack also cited US State Departmentís instructions which provide that law enforcement officials (particularly in New York) should be ìsensitiveî and†coordinate with the US authorities if confronted with a situation where a diplomat appears to have committed a crime. He said the law enforcement agent from the†Diplomatic Security Services who arrested Khobragade ìneglectedî to follow this instruction and did not call the UN Protocol office. ìHad he only done so he would have†been informed of Khobragadeís status and her arrest and humiliating and invasive personal body search would not have occurred.î According to another State Department instruction cited by Arshack, diplomatic agents also enjoy complete immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the host countryís courts and cannot be prosecuted no matter how serious the offense unless their immunity is waived by the sending state. ìHere, India, the sending state, has not waived Khobragadeís immunity and therefore this criminal prosecution must be dismissed,î he added.

La Maisoní, running out of Islamabadís F7-1, was not allowing Pakistanis in, citing the French style of cooking that uses wine. Also, the food was not halal and even pork was served. The controversial policy had led to a storm on various social media networks, with many comparing the policy to apartheid and the infamous colonial boards outside clubs in India during British rule. The momentum against the restaurant was started by Cyril Almeida, senior journalist working with a leading Pakistani daily, who launched a Twitter war against the restaurant. The restaurant-owner Philippe Lafforgue wrote to him, claiming he is changing his policy. Lafforgue, however, continued to bar Pakistanis. ìWhat can I do? I am just trying to respect the local culture. Pakistanis with dual nationality are allowed,î Lafforgue had said prior to the raid. ìBut after consulting the authorities, my advisor and my partner, I am telling you it is impossible to open a place to the public when we serve non-halal food.

The doctor,who was arrested immediately after the May 2,2011 operation by US commandos that killed then al-Qaeda leader bin Laden,was convicted for treason over alleged ties to banned militant group Lashkar-e-Islam. On August 29,a judicial official had overturned the 33-year jail sentence of Afridi,who was sentenced in May,2012 on charges of colluding with Lashkar-e-Islam. FCR Commissioner Sahibzada Mohammad Anees had ruled that a judge in the tribal belt had exceeded his authority when he handed down the sentence last year. He had ordered a fresh trial and had said it would be heard by the Political Agent. However,the doctor filed a seven-page revision petition in which he submitted that there was ambiguity in the order of FCR commissioner. He approached the FATA Tribunal,an appellate court in FCR,to clear the ambiguity so that the political agent is directed to not only conduct fresh and fair trial in his case,but also remove the ban on his bail during the trial.

Sharif is here on a four-day official visit to the US,and is scheduled to meet President Barack Obama on October 23. The Obama Administration has requested the Congress to resume security assistance to Pakistan,which now stands at 305 million US dollars for fiscal year 2014,a drop of 35 per cent against 2012 fiscal. The drop is because the Administration has not asked for a renewal of temporary Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF),which was started in 2009,a senior administration official said. ìSecretary Kerryís meeting with the PM (Sharif) is their third in three months,and continued the robust dialogue on our shared goal of a stable,secure and prosperous Pakistan,î a statement issued by the State Department said. The official emphasised that the civilian assistance was never interrupted,while the security assistance was significantly slowed,if not stopped during the period of strained relationship in the last two years. There has also been a drop of 14 per cent in the civilian assistance to Pakistan for this year as requested by the Obama Administration,which is mainly attributed to the budgetary and implementation constraints of the US,he said. ìAs part of our annual funding process,throughout the course of this past summer,the State Department notified Congress of how it planned to programme funds from several different accounts for various programmes in Pakistan. ìFunding was notified to Congress following a rigorous planning process over multiple months,to ensure that it was in line with both US and Pakistani interests,and would deliver important results for both countries. ìThe US civilian assistance to Pakistan has delivered real results on issues most important to PM Sharif and all Pakistanis,like energy,education,and economic growth,she said. ìWhile this is part of a long process of restarting security assistance cooperation after implementation was slowed during the bilateral challenges of 2011 and 2012,civilian assistance has continued uninterrupted throughout,î Harf emphasised. She said that US security assistance continues to build the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism capabilities of Pakistanís security forces,which she termed critical to countering violence in the western border regions. Citing similar reasons for the decline in the aid,a State Department official said that the strategic security assistance cooperation with Pakistan will continue through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET) programmes. ìIn consultation and collaboration with Pakistanís civilian and military leadership,the US reviewed our security assistance programmes to Pakistan and has narrowed the scope of that assistance to more directly and tangibly achieve our shared goals,î the official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the press. In February this year at a Defence Resourcing Conference,the US and Pakistan had endorsed a plan to align other assistance resources for supporting the shared counter terrorism goals,the official explained. ìWe have been in close consultation with the Government of Pakistan about changes to our security assistance programs and have been frank about our budget realities and the need to refine assistance to better meet our mutual objectives,î the official said.","Sharif meets Kerry,Congress requested to resume security assistance to Pak | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/sharif-meets-kerry-congress-requested-to-resume-security-assistance-to-pak/

Referring to his previous conversation with Clinton and also with the Saudi Prince Turki in this regard about bringing bin Laden to justice,Sharif had said the Taliban are very stubborn on this issue and that they are unlikely to listen to him. ìI told you what transpired between us and Taliban and so Saudi Prince Turki,who came especially from Saudi Arabia on that particular issue,and they were very stubborn. We will do everything we can,I assure you,î Sharif had said,according to the declassified document running into three pages. ìI will send my people tomorrow to Afghanistan to meet with them and discuss this with them,and tell them this will not be in their interest and it will serve no purpose,that it will invite retaliation and a world reaction.

More than 200 homes have already been destroyed and another 120 damaged by the wildfires,which broke out across New South Wales state in unseasonably warm weather earlier this week,fanned by extremely high winds. The worst of the fires,in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney,plunged the city last week into an eerie midday darkness as plumes of smoke and ash filled the sky. One man has died so far trying to protect his property. Firefighters had a reprieve on Friday and Saturday with an easing in the weather,but containment and property protection efforts were stepped up today ahead of an expected intensification in weather conditions set to include warmer temperatures and 100 kilometre per hour (60 mile per hour) winds. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said there would be several extremely difficult days ahead for fire crews. ìWeíve got what would be unparallelled in terms of risk and exposure for the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury communities throughout this week,î Fitzsimmons told reporters. ìIf you are to draw a parallel,and itís always dangerous to draw a parallel,at best youíd be going back to time periods in the late 60s.î ìThe reality is,however,these conditions that weíre looking at are a whole new ball-game and in a league of their own.î State premier Barry OíFarrell said crews had carried out controlled burn operations through the night to strengthen buffer zones around the major Blue Mountains fires and ìare on alert to switch to active firefighting if properties come under threatî. A total fire ban was in place in the Greater Sydney and three other regions across the state until further notice. An emergency warning was issued for the Blue Mountains village of Bell on today morning,with residents urged to evacuate,if they were able,or to ìtake shelter in a solid structure when the fire front arrivesî.",Parts of Australia facing worst bushfire threat in 40 years | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/parts-of-australia-facing-worst-bushfire-threat-in-40-years/
823,"Dozens of high school students scrambled among the sand dunes here in recent days, learning how to shoot AK-47 rifles, crawl under barbed wire and jump over burning tires. Their bearded commanders barked at those who were too slow in hoisting iron bars overhead or those who hesitated around the thick flames. Having seen two major Israeli military operations in Gaza in their short lives, many of the teenagers came to this boot camp, which is run by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has led Gaza since 2007, to prepare for what they see as the inevitable next round. ìBy then, I should be ready and know how to deal with the Israeli soldierís gun when I pick it up from the ground,î said Mohammed Ghanem, 15. If the Israelis do not make another incursion into Gaza, he said, ìwe will go to fight them on the borderî. The six-day programme, Futuwwa, enrolled about 13,000 boys at nearly a dozen sites across the Gaza Strip over the past week, with trainers from the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. It was the first time the programme had taken place during a school break, and it grew out of an elective that has been offered in Gazaís high schools since 2012 that consists mainly of lectures about weapons, street-fighting techniques, fitness and Israelís recruitment of spies. ìWe target the students to create future soldiers and leaders who can defend their cause and appreciate the value of resistance,î said a Qassam member identified only as Abu Mahmoud. The Futuwwa programme, supported by the Hamas Education Ministry, followed other recent efforts by Hamas to inculcate Gazaís youths with its militant ideology. Last year, for a required ìnational educationî course in government schools, Hamas introduced its own textbooks that do not recognize modern Israel or mention the Oslo peace accords, which Israel signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the mid-1990s. Hamas lawmakers also voted to require gender-segregated schools and outlaw any educational cooperation with Israel. Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister of Gaza, told Futuwwa participants at a graduation ceremony Tuesday in Gaza City that theirs was ìthe generation that will achieve the liberation and independenceî of Palestine. Suggesting that the programme would soon be provided for girls as well, Haniya predicted that Israel would face ìa Palestinian generation that weakness knows no way into their heartsî.",Hamas trains  kids for future war with Israel | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/middle-east-and-africa/hamas-trains-kids-for-future-war-with-israel/
824,"Related. Bomb attacks and shootings killed at least 75 people in Iraq Wednesday, police and hospital sources said, making it one of the bloodiest days in months. In the deadliest incident, a bomb blew up in a funeral tent where mourners were marking the death two days ago of a Sunni Muslim pro-government militiaman, police said. It killed 18 and wounded 16 in Shatub, a village south of Baquba. In northwestern Iraq, assailants detonated roadside bombs near a bridge in Ain al-Jahash, 60 km south of Mosul as an army patrol was crossing it. Six soldiers were killed and eight people were wounded, six of them civilians, police said. Gunmen killed seven truck drivers, kidnapped two and set three trucks ablaze in the mainly Shia district of Maamil in Baghdadís eastern outskirts, police said. The army is locked in a standoff with Sunni militants who overran Falluja, a city west of Baghdad, more than two weeks ago in a challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Malikiís Shia-led government. They are led by the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), fighting in western Iraq and Syria to carve out a cross-border Islamist fiefdom. ìThe battle will be long and will continue,î Maliki said on state television, calling for world support. ìIf we keep silent, it means the creation of evil statelets that would wreak havoc with security in the region and the world.î Maliki has ruled out an assault on Falluja by the troops and tanks ringing the city of 300,000, but has told local tribesmen to expel ISIL, which has exploited anger among minority Sunnis against a government they accuse of oppression. The violence has dismayed leaders of Iraqís autonomous Kurdish region. ìThis is a disaster,î its presidentís chief of staff Fuad Hussein told Reuters. ìNow the whole country is being threatened by terrorists, so we need to have a common front.î At least eight bombs struck the capital, mostly in Shia districts, killing 40 and wounding 88. The bombings followed attacks that cost at least 24 lives the day before, as well as coordinated assaults by militants on a highway bridge and police station near Falluja. The gunmen withdrew towards Falluja Wednesday, making use of a corridor the army had left for civilians. Troops and tanks then retook the police station, turning it into an army base, and civilians living nearby fled towards Falluja, police said.","Bomb attacks, shootings kill 75 in Iraq, PM calls for world support | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/middle-east-and-africa/bomb-attacks-shootings-kill-75-in-iraq-pm-calls-for-world-support/
825,"Summary. Related. The talk,wherever you go chasing elections in Uttar Pradesh,is about education,jobs,better life,aspiration. Why we call this random series of writings from different and diverse parts of. India,often during the elections,<U+0093>Writings on the Wall<U+0094> needs repetition. So many years of training as a reporter-writer have taught me that one of the best ways of figuring out what is going on in our country,what is changing,for better or worse,or not changing at all,is written,literally,on our walls. So if you go to the most prosperous zones of India,take Punjab for example,you will find Mercs,credit cards,housing loans and easy visas and immigration to exotic destinations like <U+0093>Kanada<U+0094> being sold on the walls. You go to a flourishing new green revolution zone like coastal Andhra,and you will see the walls selling you tractors,cement,iron rods for construction (sariya). In the really poor zones,the wares displayed are usually more basic: snuff,itch cream. And then there are the poorest of poor zones that have no walls,so no writings to read. We also noted in several of our travels through the years,and chronicled in this series (find earlier writings in this series at http://www.indianexpress.com/news/writings-on-the-wall/713872/ ) that one of the big new changes sweeping the country,and evident in the writings on the wall,was the desperate hunger for modern education. The walls of Bundelkhand are not much of an exception. The bone-dry zone that begins generally 300 km southeast of Delhi and then spreads out in a 350-km radius across Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh,has been in the headlines lately since Rahul Gandhi discovered it for national politics. Bundelkhand is supposed to represent everything that has gone wrong with the Hindi heartland: casteism,de-industrialisation,mafia rule,destitution,serial droughts and desperate migration. A hopeless,depressing and dangerous Omkara-land,where a Vishal Bhardwaj could find plots for the rest of his life. But drive through Bundelkhand,as we,the usual motley group of journalists,psephologists,economists and finance whiz-kids,the self-styled Limousine Liberals did last week,and the reality seems a little bit different. Sure,Bundelkhand is drier,more sparsely populated and factory-less than the rest of the Hindi heartland. But roads are good,particularly the new,narrow but tarred village roads built under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). There are government schools spilling over with uniformed children and plenty of private schools and colleges advertised on the walls. There isn<U+0092>t as much construction as you<U+0092>d find elsewhere in the country,but the three large modern constructions,coming up on the 100-km stretch of national highway between Jhansi and Mauranipur,are just what you<U+0092>d expect <U+0097> technical colleges. So there is demand,there is hunger and,beg,borrow or steal,there is inclination to pay. So what is new or different on the walls in Bundelkhand? There is something different,and you do not have to search too hard. Engineering,management,medical,dental colleges,wide-curriculum private colleges and universities,even English-medium <U+0093>convents<U+0094> you can find anywhere now. But where else would you find giant boards staring down at you on highways selling coaching for NDA (National Defence Academy),IMA (Indian Military Academy),SSB (Services Selection Board),Army,Navy,Air Force <U+0093>under the guidance of former senior officers<U+0094>? One of the more popular coaching centres is run by a group called <U+0093>Antar-Prantiya (inter-state) Brigadiers and Colonels<U+0094>. Another one has a picture of an assault commando in war paint,a big,bold <U+0093>josh<U+0094> printed on the top,and then a gallery of mug-shots of pupils selected for military academies in recent years. Now,you will see similar advertisements for IAS and IIT/IIM coaching schools. But military academies? If our armed forces are short of officer talent,this is where they should be coming. The composition of voluntary armed forces in democracies has its own sociology. They are the favourite route to empowerment for the underclass: just see the rising number of African-Americans and Hispanics in the US armed forces. Given such a hard deal by nature,and a crueller one by politics and caste,the Bundelkhandis have found their aspirational vehicle in the armed forces. So do not just fret noticing how many of the security guards in our colonies,all unskilled migrants in ill-fitting uniforms doing 12-hour shifts on minimum wages,are Bundelkhandis. For each one of them,there is probably one preparing for an exam that would earn him a proper uniform,pride,love and respect of the nation,pips of an officer and a very decent lifestyle. Five full days of travels through Uttar Pradesh<U+0092>s heartland and its distant Bundelkhand only underline the fact that the aspirational upsurge that we have seen envelop the rest of India is also vibrant here,never mind the state<U+0092>s broken politics where a mere 30 per cent vote share can reward you with a majority and 25 per cent leaves you a distant second. No wonder then that all the four vote-seekers,the SP,BSP,Congress and BJP,speak the same aspirational language,though the idiom and emphasis vary. Mulayam Singh Yadav and his very polite and affable son (the youngest key campaigner at 38),Akhilesh,are focusing on distancing themselves from a past they acknowledge nobody has any time for: a past of criminal,bahubali (as political mafiosi are called in UP) politics and of Luddite rejection of technology and English. So the party now promises free laptops and tablets to students breaking into senior classes,and they can choose the gadget in the language they prefer: Hindi,Urdu,or English. Akhilesh says the key to the future is public-private partnerships (PPPs),and one of Mayawati<U+0092>s key allegations against the Centre is that it hobbled UP<U+0092>s growth by not clearing her most ambitious PPP projects. The BJP would remind you that Vajpayee launched the road-building campaign and it would even turn around parched Bundelkhand by importing drip irrigation technology from Israel. Rahul Gandhi,in fact,is the only one not invoking the private sector,PPPs etc,in any way,but more than his message,his presence is aspirational in its own way,though less so as this campaign has progressed and old-timers in his party have broken his momentum by dragging in reservations for Muslim backwards. But more about that on Tuesday. If you stay on the beautiful new four-lane highway,the drive from Kanpur city through Kanpur Dehat (rural) into Bundelkhand can be quite misleading. Because the country is lush,flat and deep,springtime yellow with blooming mustard,and less thickly populated as you go along. You get off that highway,and the story begins to unfold. At Derapur<U+0092>s buzzing village haat,freshly harvested gobhi,tomato (Rs 18 for 5 kg),green chillies and cabbage sell with mostly Chinese manufactured goods and churans (powders) that fix everything from flatulence to premature ejaculation. But shopkeepers and buyers all collect around any talk of politics. A straw poll tells you not a single Dalit is voting any way other than Mayawati<U+0092>s. Muslims,if you generally added those spoken to by 20 of us,are divided seven to three between SP and Congress. The three who are breaking rank from the SP are all college students and are doing so because of the promise of reservations. Several of Mulayam<U+0092>s old voters are returning to him,convinced of his promise to give up on <U+0093>goondai<U+0094> as politically protected mafia rule is described here,but many others aren<U+0092>t. Everybody acknowledges that Behenji has restored order and sorted out the thugs,but has she done enough for all? No. And what about Chief Medical Officers murdered inside her prisons? Similarly,everybody also acknowledges that Rahul Gandhi has worked really hard and looks sincere but also that neither he nor the BJP is in the race. The Congress in particular seems to suffer from an utter lack of organisation on the ground to build on the initial momentum Rahul had created. It is also let down severely by some of its stars,notably its Lok Sabha MP Anu Tandon from Unnao,not far from here. At Dostipur,a tiny rurban sprawl on the outskirts of Unnao,a huddle of men talks indignantly of how they were fooled by the Congress and Anu Tandon,though they do not quite use polite language,preferring instead the expression a brave actor like Vidya Balan in Ishqiya or Saif Ali Khan in Omkara would have spoken with such panache. <U+0093>Congress aur Anu Tandon ne hamaara khoob ch*** banaya,<U+0094> is the refrain,as she <U+0093>promised<U+0094> to bring Reliance factories here but never even showed up after that once. And this was a group of Brahmins that voted Congress in 2009. Because this is a relatively new part of the village,castes inter-mix here rather more than in the usual old setting,with Dalits,Brahmins and OBC gadariyas (graziers) sharing boundary walls and compounds. But caste is still intact,and just how it works is demonstrated devastatingly in the covered verandah of a pucca old house just yards down the same dusty lane flanked by two black,open,clogged drains,so typical of semi-urban India. What is the old,slight gentleman doing standing there in a clean,rather crisp shirt,but in just striped,cotton,stringed underwear below it? Then you see his trousers. Mr Shiv Narain is a bania and sells trinkets on a cart. Now he is going out to visit relatives. So Bhanwari is pressing a razor-sharp crease on his trousers with a coal-fired iron,and never mind that it is rather too big for her thin arms and slight frame. She is from the dhobi caste,on the lower rungs of the Dalit pyramid,but there is no awkwardness between her and the bania with his pants down. This is a classical example of caste-determined economic interdependence and both coolly chat us up,Limousine Liberals. Bhanwari has a pile of neatly ironed laundry behind her,and tells us she makes at least Rs 200 a day. So there is a market for ironed clothes even in Dostipur. And why must she work so hard? Because three of her grandchildren now go to college. Somebody has to pay for them. The talk,wherever you go,is not about food or starvation. It is about education,jobs,better life. You still have doubts? Come with us to Lalganj,a bit far to the northeast from here,on the road between Rae Bareli and Pratapgarh. At a local <U+0093>kitchen-se-coronary-tak<U+0094> type restaurant of sorts that serves chowmein garnished with freshly chopped dhania and garam masala and deadly fluffy bhaturas,and displays Diet Coke,we are joined by romancing young couples who exchange coy glances and whisper over gulab jamuns in donas (leaf plates),a little in the manner of the old <U+0093>Muslim socials<U+0094> of Hindi cinema that went out with Rajendra Kumar and Sadhna. You can<U+0092>t even think of intruding. But two young boys,schoolbags and all,draw us into conversation. They are both Shuklas,though not related,speak excellent English,of the kind Hindustan Times matrimonials would describe as <U+0093>convented<U+0094> and study in a local school,called,check it out,Einstein Public School. It so happens that their headmaster is a Shukla too,but they say the school has pupils from all castes and,<U+0093>more importantly<U+0094>,an English-speaking faculty drawn from all over the country that <U+0093>even includes some Bengalis<U+0094>. They both want to go to IIT,and are already pursuing special coaching from a Kota-based institute by correspondence. Do they feel they can compete with those living in big cities? <U+0093>Ya,ya,<U+0094> they say. <U+0093>No problem. Einstein (the school) has Internet,computers,uninterrupted power.<U+0094> Tiny Lalganj may indeed have its aspirational gem in Einstein Public School,but you cannot pass a single habitation that does not boast of something called a convent. <U+0093>Convents<U+0094>,named after Hindu gods and goddesses,from Lakshmi to Shiva,Ram to Hanuman,Sikh gurus,sometimes simply after some owner<U+0092>s own father,flourish everywhere as government schools rot. At Orai,in the Bundelkhand district of Jalaun,you even find a signboard that invites you to <U+0093>Lettle Angels<U+0094> English medium school near <U+0093>Hallypad<U+0094>. You can laugh at this mushrooming private business in schools,but when you want your children to break out of a place not going anywhere,and join the vast,new booming world outside,you need English. In the Dalit quarter of Kallupuruwa in Rae Bareli,a woman,a mother of two,is severely indignant when asked if she can feed her children properly. <U+0093>Of course,we feed them,and feed them very well,<U+0094> she says,<U+0093>the problem is,we are not left with enough money to send them to a really good English medium school as the fee there is Rs 300 per child. We send them to the one with 120-rupee fee.<U+0094> And what about government schools? Urmila smiles that smile of vicious disdain,as if to say,you send your children to government schools. Leave mine to me. Back to Bundelkhand,the land of so much history,folklore,politics and now hopelessness and headlines. BJP<U+0092>s Sudheendra Kulkarni (and a Sunday Express columnist),campaigning here,tells us Bundelkhand has more monuments than all of Rajasthan,and you can believe that,as the region,ruled for a millennium by the Bundelas and the Chandelas,stretching from Gwalior to Jhansi to Orchcha to Kalinjar to Khajuraho,packs so much history and heritage. And oodles of creativity. For evidence,come to Jhansi railway station late at night and read the inscriptions below the dimly lit busts of Maithili Sharan Gupt,Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi and Vrindavan Lal Verma,three of the most towering figures of contemporary Hindi literature,all sons of Bundelkhand. What it does not have is water. And the one scheme that could have changed its face,the interlinking of the Ken and the Betwa,two rivers in the same Yamuna basin,became a casualty of the UPA<U+0092>s early phase of unquestioned environmental activism,in spite of the fact that the three riparian states,UP,MP and Rajasthan,had already signed an agreement on it. If Bundelkhand became a state,as Mayawati wants,Jhansi would be its capital. Jhansi,with its imposing citadel and the history of the famous national heroine of 1857. You would expect the immortal lines from Subhadra Kumari Chauhan<U+0092>s tribute to the Rani of Jhansi,that all of us had to memorise in our school Hindi classes,to be repeated in every campaigner<U+0092>s rally here. Not surprisingly then,as Sonia Gandhi arrives to address a reasonable-sized rally on a burnishing afternoon,the crowd-warmer is reciting the most familiar lines from that ballad: <U+0093>Boodhe Bharat mein bhi aayi phir se nayi jawani thiÖ Chamak uthi sun sattavan mein woh talwar purani thi (Tired,ageing India had risen with youthful rejuvenation,the rusted sword of the old was gleaming again in 1857)<U+0094>; and then he carries on,utterly unselfconsciously,<U+0093>door phirangi ko karne kei,sab ne man mein thani thi (everybody was determined now to throw out the firangi,the foreigner).<U+0094> Exactly at that moment Sonia Gandhi ascends the stage to the chants of <U+0093>Zindabad<U+0094>. This is India during an election,this is quintessential India,anytime. Intriguing,incredible and never without a surprise or an irony. (Part Two on Tuesday: From Lohiaite doggerel to modern mantras,a master-key to power and a touch of Taare Zameen Par,though not exactly what you think)","Coaching colonels in Bundelkhand,Einstein Public School in Lalganj | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/coaching-colonels-in-bundelkhand-einstein-public-school-in-lalganj/
826,"Related. Until the very untimely death of her husband (Digvijay Singh of the JD-U),Putul Kumari Singh was just a traditional Thakur wife. But there was also an inevitability to her being pitchforked into politics,as her husband<U+0092>s successor,and now she is contesting as an independent in the Lok Sabha by-election at Banka which,she tells you,has been ranked the third most backward district in India. And you can see some evidence of that as you drive so gratefully into the abandoned cinema hall,now converted into some kind of election office. Gratefully,because she has offered to feed us all lunch,a luxury in a countryside where dhaba entrepreneurship has not yet caught up with the new highways. She went to Delhi<U+0092>s Hans Raj College,says she knows nothing about politics,and could she rather answer our questions in Hindi? But as conversation picks up,you figure she has no problem with either the English language or politics. She is in it,she says,only because of <U+0093>dada<U+0094>,as her husband was popularly known. And it is widespread affection for him,despite his feudal origins in parts where zamindari still reigns,that makes her contest a cakewalk. She talks about what her late husband did for the poor,but also graciously acknowledges Nitish<U+0092>s wisdom. People talk only of the roads,she says,but you have to go deep into the villages to see the value of small bridges and culverts he has built all over a state that becomes an archipelago every monsoon. In the past,people had no way of taking a sick person or a woman in labour to a hospital in the monsoon. Now that is changing,and people are happy. Chatting with her and her supporters,many of them incorrigible Lohiaites and JNU alumni like their <U+0093>dada<U+0094>,you think about the irony of Digvijay and now his <U+0093>Rani sahiba<U+0094> defying feudalism with their stone-poor voters. Povertarians and their maths. Digvijay left Banka early to study at JNU where socialism is the default syllabus. He ended up a Lohiaite and a minister. He was chosen to be minister-in-waiting for Musharraf when he came for the Agra summit and would regale you with accounts of their conversations. One that sticks to my memory: driving past central Delhi<U+0092>s Tees January Marg,Musharraf asked him why did it have such an unusual name. <U+0093>Because Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated here on this date,in that building,<U+0094> Digvijay said,pointing to Birla House. A president of Pakistan,one who rose to be its chief of staff through the finest training colleges,staff college,NDC,etc,etc,does not even know simple facts about the subcontinent<U+0092>s history? And here a feudal from India<U+0092>s third most backward district reached JNU to become a socialist and is the democratic link between Bharat and India. That should teach us a little humility and gratitude the next time we begin to badmouth our politics. His followers,working with Putul,are still wedded to their original ideology. Nitish,they say,has done well so far,but will fail in the long run. Why? Because,his model of fighting poverty is that of Dr Manmohan Singh,with growth and investment,<U+0093>aur Bihar mein,bade bhai,yeh nahin chalegaÖ<U+0094> You soon get a chance to put that to the Writings on the Wall test. At Sangrampur,a picturesque,winding 40-odd km drive from Banka,at a halwai shop called <U+0093>Gupta Hotel<U+0094> where flies in millions endorse the quality of mithai,I conduct a quick census of how many of the 29 people hanging around there <U+0097> rickshaw-pullers and casual labourers lounging on the rickshaws while they wait for work <U+0097> have cellphones. Can you guess the result? All 29. Now,all of them are very very poor people,all of them could do with better nourishment. But starving they aren<U+0092>t. And while they will fall below any reasonably defined poverty line,they are not living on less than Rs 20 a day,as many of our Great Establishment Povertarians claim 83.6 crore Indians do. In fact,if you see this purely anecdotal score of 29 out of 29 in such a poor region,the telecom industry<U+0092>s figure of 75 crore phones looks totally real. So where are the 80 per cent Indians <U+0093>living on less than Rs 20 a day<U+0094>? The wisdom thrown up by the cellphone census is affirmed later as we stop at an IndianOil petrol pump near the Barauni refinery that has a well-stocked grocery store which even sells oodles of branded ice-cream. I stand in the queue to pay,behind four customers who do not look like they would come to buy ice-cream,and they haven<U+0092>t. Each one,a local labourer or casual worker,has come to buy <U+0093>recharge<U+0094> for his mobile phone prepaid card. Banka is very very poor,for sure. Parts of the district,particularly those bordering Jharkhand,we are told,are Naxal-infested. We drive all the way up to the bazaar of Katoria,the heart of a Scheduled Tribe constituency,and ask if anybody had seen a Maoist. At many villages on the way back,notably Belhar,allegedly deeper in Naxal zone,some of us got desperate enough to conduct almost a straw poll. Maoists,you want to see? We<U+0092>ve heard there are some in tribal villages. But just the landscape on the way back compensates you for not seeing any Naxals. As the road winds through dried watercourses and degraded forest,you see the most stunning sunset in a sky that is a million shades of crimson,over a shallow but sprawling reservoir created by a British-built dam. This water gives this district its only privilege: irrigation. Which,in turn,gives it the one thing it is proud of,its wonderfully fragrant <U+0093>katrani<U+0094> rice,a small-grain,sweet cousin of the basmati family. I brought home some and it is delicious. Somebody at Katoria says they want to apply for a GI certification. Dreams of GI certification in Banka,one of India<U+0092>s poorest districts,where,if you follow the NAC-Povertarian definition,100 per cent should be living at less than ten rupees a day? You have to admit even Bharat is changing. How Rahul<U+0092>s <U+0091>Congress<U+0092>s got talent<U+0092> has flopped. Most Indian cities are now in a state of deep rot,with garbage spilling into streets,stray cattle,encroachments and killer smoke from gen-sets. But,as you would expect,Bhagalpur could be one of the worst,despite the Ganga in such a vast expanse,with a tourist bounty of dolphins,and the riches traditionally generated by its tassar silk weavers. Two generations of Indians identify this unfortunate town with the blindings of petty but chronic criminals by its police,originally exposed by this newspaper in 1980. But you see change in Bhagalpur too. There are a couple of mini-malls and showrooms,and,right in front of our hotel,in a street packed with pavement shopkeepers by day and herds of amorous cows and the biggest bulls (maybe Mumbai<U+0092>s brokers should hire them) by night,you see a brand new shop selling <U+0093>equities,mutual funds,derivatives,fixed deposits,commodities.<U+0094> You also know you are not far from Jharkhand when you see Dhoni smiling down at you from every other hoarding. Seems he can convince people here to buy anything. I counted at least six: apartments,cement,saria (iron rods),suiting,satellite TV and,inevitably,mobile phones. Dhoni<U+0092>s rising stock,meanwhile,is only matched by the fall from grace of the Bihari superstar,Lalu. At his meeting in Munger,his jokes,including the familiar Lalu-aloo ones,draw a groan. He does draw a crowd,but there is no electricity,as in much of the state he ran into the ground for 18 years. As his helicopter departs,Mohammed Anwar Hussain,a young Urdu teacher in a college in nearby Ghazipur,walks along with me and asks if we are from the <U+0093>media<U+0094> (amazing how no one says journalist or patrakar any more). <U+0093>Lalu kehte hain,hum khayenge bhaat-aloo,aapko khayega mota bhaalu,<U+0094> he,a three-time Lalu voter,says,disdain spilling out from this really awful rhyme scheme. <U+0093>But aren<U+0092>t you afraid of the BJP?<U+0094> I ask. <U+0093>Why? We have been fine for five years under Nitish. And look at this sher ka bachcha. He has kept Modi out of Bihar. Has anybody ever been able to keep Modi out of an entire election campaign?<U+0094> Not all Muslims would vote for Nitish,for sure. But he may have done just enough to rock the <U+0093>M<U+0094> in Lalu<U+0092>s winning <U+0093>M-Y<U+0094> (Muslim-Yadav) formula. Lalu,of course,would not agree. But the usual bluster is gone. <U+0093>Sarkar to jod-tod ke hamaari hi banegi,<U+0094> he taps me on the arm and whispers,almost apologetically,after he has fed us a sizeable high tea. Indian politicians<U+0092> minds,actually,are quite easy to read when they are in trouble. For example,when a leader starts discussing his strategic errors in the middle of a campaign,you know he thinks his time is up. Lalu says his big mistake was insisting on the imposition of president<U+0092>s rule after Nitish failed to secure a vote of confidence in the first,inconclusive election of 2005. Then,he would imply,Buta Singh as governor messed up everything. <U+0093>If only I had listened to Soniaji,<U+0094> he says. <U+0093>She pleaded so many times with me not to insist on president<U+0092>s rule,but I did not listen.<U+0094> And then he tells you what he is missing,the comforting embrace of the Congress party,a share of power at the Centre. <U+0093>Soniaji,hum aapse kehte hain,is very good,noble,gentleman lady. Humne unki nahin suni.<U+0094> Of course,his other regret is alienating the upper castes. <U+0093>I was never against them. I only talk. Lalu is like the two-headed snake. He only hisses,but cannot bite,<U+0094> he says,and promises that the next time he comes to power,he will go out of his way to make up to the upper castes. When that will happen,who knows. But one thing you can say for sure,Lalu himself will be the most surprised if it were to happen this time. One look at his face,and you know he has read the writing on the wall. And while he misses the Congress,you wonder if the feeling will be mutual. Sonia and Rahul both draw much better crowds than you have seen at Congress rallies in the past in Bihar,but it is difficult to see these translating into votes,as their message of Nitish<U+0092>s ineptitude and corruption,or hypocrisy on communalism,does not yet wash. At Sonia<U+0092>s really large rally at Begusarai,a group of schoolboys in uniform snigger as they mimic her delivery of the word <U+0093>chintajanak<U+0094> with one vowel compressed and the other stretched. But her rapidly-improving Hindi diction is not the problem. The problem could,in fact,be the kind of talent Rahul<U+0092>s hunt has thrown up,at least in Bihar. His newly-elected Youth Congress chief Lallan Kumar was <U+0093>caught<U+0094> that very morning in an EC raid with nearly Rs 6 lakh in cash,and was now a most disastrous crowd-warmer until Sonia arrived. <U+0093>Look at Nitish<U+0092>s raj,<U+0094> he said,<U+0093>where milk has dried up in all of Bihar<U+0092>s mothers<U+0092> breasts,but ministers are feeding milk to their dogs in Patna.<U+0094> Now,you may love or hate dogs,but if this is the kind of genius Rahul<U+0092>s talent-hunt is finding,you might be better off even with the idiots of the past. The quiet smile on Nitish<U+0092>s face. The man smiling through all of this is one you rarely ever see smiling. Or frowning,or displaying any emotion at all. But Nitish Kumar thinks he has got it in the bag. We tell him Lalu tells us even JD-U MPs are not campaigning for him. <U+0093>Our party,<U+0094> he says,smirking for once,<U+0093>has the most remarkable MPs.<U+0094> And goes on to repeat what Lalu had just told us,that one has taken a ticket from Lalu for his wife,the other for his brother. But he is understadedly nonchalant. He gets chirpy only when talking of his bicycle scheme <U+0097> and underlines the fact that he did not let his government buy these but gave Rs 2,000 to each student to buy one,thereby making it <U+0093>a direct cash transfer.<U+0094> His biggest challenge now is electricity. By the way,do you know how much electricity Bihar consumes? Just 900 megawatts,less than what our suburb of Gurgaon burns. And how much power does Bihar produce? Just about 150 megawatts. On a flight to Mumbai last week,BJP President Nitin Gadkari,on his way back from Bihar,tells me how embarrassed he is to realise that his own company<U+0092>s power generation is more than that of the entire state of Bihar. Nitish also has complaints about the Centre. He respects the prime minister,he says,and finds,sometimes,a meeting with him is like a UPSC interview. The PM sounds like he means well,but Bihar is squeezed in every way possible,from coal linkages (none in the Eleventh Plan) to disbursals under Central schemes. But he has the air of somebody who does not worry much about anything for now,or for that matter,about his BJP allies. At a very generous dinner of ghee-soaked Bihari litti at the home of the BJP<U+0092>s very familiar and friendly spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad,he arrives and sits quietly,unobtrusively. Almost on cue,BJP<U+0092>s ever-sulking state president C.P. Thakur tiptoes out,without a hi or bye. The only BJP man Nitish has time for is Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and,for his national ally,it is good enough that the two get along. It knows the value of this alliance,and that is the reason they have indulged Nitish in a way you would never expect the Congress to indulge a regional ally. They have agreed to keep Narendra Modi out of the campaign. Would the Congress ever agree to keep a Gandhi out of a state campaign just to please a regional ally,howsoever important? Now you know why the Congress<U+0092>s second hope,that,even if Nitish wins a big one here,he might be a prospective ally for the future,is premature. Postscript: I must conclude any notes from the road,as usual,with something interesting and colourful I spotted on a wall. This time,it was Kids Conventt at Rupasu on N.H. 31,and you<U+0092>d hope those kids would learn to spell somehow. And,of course,a liquor shop near Barauni named <U+0093>Pyaasa Sawan<U+0094> (the thirsty monsoon). Now doesn<U+0092>t that sound like fun?","When lonely Lalu misses <U+0091>gentleman<U+0092> Sonia,and a Muslim calls Nitish <U+0091>sher ka bachcha<U+0092> | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/when-lonely-lalu-misses-gentleman-sonia-and-a-muslim-calls-nitish-sher-ka-bachcha/
827,"Related. How do you ever figure out what goes on in India? You can read newspapers and books,imbibe unlimited (and usually repetitive) gyan from a cartel of about a dozen talking heads who control the opinion industry on the newspaper op-ed pages and TV channels,talk to experts,listen to politicians,professors,godmen or astrologers. But having tried all of these and more,some from both sides,I have come to the conclusion that there is no better teacher of what<U+0092>s going on in India,particularly if you love travelling by road,than reading writings on the wall. This is particularly true of the India,or Bharat,that we usually know so little about. In decades of travelling,I have figured that if you keep your eye on the walls as you (if you are on a decent strip of asphalt) sprint past them or (if it is the usual north Indian minefield of a road) bounce up and down and move a mile in five minutes,you know what is going on,what is changing and what is not. So if you go to a really rich part of India,say,Punjab,the walls will display advertisements and messages from airlines offering cheap tickets to England or <U+0093>Kanada<U+0094>,discounts and freebies for buying mid-sized cars,even services to fix your visas and passports. You go to the slightly less rich regions,and you find the writings on the walls selling you tractors,fertiliser,cement,farm loans. Even poorer regions will have walls displaying advertisements for snuff,itch creams,bidis. And the really,really poor,will either have no walls (as in parts of Bihar and Orissa) or will either have no messages or,wherever a little awakening is now visible,particularly since the arrival of Nitish Kumar,advertisements for the one industry that signals a national renaissance <U+0097> in howsoever twisted a fashion <U+0097> education. So you see <U+0093>English-medium<U+0094> schools and IIT-IIM-medical college entrance-test coaching centres advertised in places where walls would have been blank a few years ago. So when I travel,particularly as a member of a small and motley group of journalists,TV anchors,psephologists and economists <U+0097> the self-proclaimed Limousine Liberals in an election <U+0097> I search for the message of change (or the lack of it) from what is written on the walls. As I did in the course of this election campaign,while driving from the driest regions of India (northern Karnataka and a stretch of Rayalseema in Andhra) to some of the lushest (coastal Andhra) and from our most resurgent cities (Bangalore) to our most wannabe (Hyderabad). Fertiliser and cement were still there,but in the drier zones,where there had been almost nothing earlier. So were farm loans,motorcycles,even the odd refrigerator. It was evident,therefore,that some kind of irrigation <U+0097> a two-crop system that produced some surplus and made the farmer think of investing so he could move from subsistence to (agricultural) market economy <U+0097> had arrived in a region which God had decided to place under a terrible rain shadow. Of course much of what<U+0092>s depressing with. rurbanising (the rural equivalent of gentrification in cities) in the rest of India was also visible on the road skirting Cuddapah: filth,rotten infrastructure; putrid,stinking. water-courses and encroachments. But in the middle of all this,Dhoni and Deepika Padukone selling you soft drinks were not the only ones providing some colour. There was also,quite incredibly,branded chicken. At grocery shops in village after village,at tiny butcher shops,on top of carcasses of freshly-slaughtered goats,you find hoardings and boards selling branded chicken: Suguna,Venky<U+0092>s,and more. So even the butcher<U+0092>s shop in Srikalahasti,a tiny place not far from Tirupati <U+0097> which boasts a cute railway station of the kind you see in southern movies,with LCD display panes,clean toilets and cafeteria,the sort you will NEVER find in a village in Bihar from where almost all our rail ministers come <U+0097> the local Mr Butcher works from a wooden shack sitting on an obvious encroachment; but he has a small refrigerator,a power connection and even a Honda generator in case power goes off,to preserve his unsold meat <U+0097> and,of course,branded chicken. Branded chicken in a chronic drought and poverty zone where NREGA has been a life-saver may be a stunning paradox. But so is the man who so generously invites us for dinner in coastal,and much richer,Nellore,nearly 200 km to the north-east. Chandrababu Naidu was once the darling of reformers,of free-market economists,the Indian and foreign media and of course the larger,liberal intellectual class. All of which,he now tells us over a multi-course and fiery coastal Andhra meal,were the reasons why he lost power. <U+0093>I got so obsessed with praise from all of you,that I lost contact with people,<U+0094> he says. And then goes on to explain with the sort of candour and articulateness you wouldn<U+0092>t expect from an Indian politician,particularly a regional,third-front type: <U+0093>I became a nationalist,a statesman,and got obsessed with that image. I forgot my villages,the voters,and I will never make that mistake again. Five years out of power have been terrible. I have really suffered and struggled.<U+0094> He then unveils his modified <U+0093>reform<U+0094> thinking. Pro-market reforms,he says,must continue,but you can<U+0092>t wait for trickle-down as <U+0093>I did the last time.<U+0094> Reform will create wealth,he says,but the state must distribute it immediately. His solution,however,is more immediate than you would have imagined: he carries an ATM machine with him and tells voters how he will give cards to all the poor so,once a month,all they need to do is push the card into the machine,and Rs 2,000 will come out,and this is how. At a fairly energetic campaign meeting in the heart of Nellore that has at least a dozen OB vans (all from local,Telugu channels; most of them owned by politicians) in attendance,he gets a response when he explains his cash transfer scheme. As he would,at least initially,from reform economists who have been asking for just this in place of the usual government schemes for years. Except he wants this to be in addition to all the rest,including NREGA. And from where will he get the money to finance these? Naidu has some ideas that come straight from hell. He would impose a stiff inheritance tax and estate duty. After all,<U+0093>Why should a rich man<U+0092>s children get all his wealth without having earned it?<U+0094> This,of course,will be in addition to much higher income taxes in his new,confiscatory economics and because India can<U+0092>t have <U+0093>more billionaires than Japan<U+0094>. And he is not willing to listen,howsoever much you argue against his ideas on merit. <U+0093>Sir,I listened to people like you,and lost power. I will never do that again,<U+0094> he says with a smile that is half-determination and half-apology,even as somebody realises that it is 12 midnight and therefore time to wish Naidu a happy birthday and leave him to a few hours of hard-earned sleep. But,if sleeping late and little is the hazard of a politician<U+0092>s life,nobody is better trained to handle it than the film star <U+0097> in this case,Chiranjeevi,whom we catch up with in Palakollu,his parents-in-law<U+0092>s town,not far from coastal Rajahmundhry and one of the two constituencies he is contesting from. He invites us to dinner at one of his friends<U+0092> (a film producer) plush home but turns up himself only well past midnight,fresh and on-the-go as if another day<U+0092>s work was just about to begin. He is too simple and uncomplicated to be a politician yet. Born Konidela Shiva Shankara Vara Prasad to a police constable,he says he changed his name to Chiranjeevi after a dream. Then,having spent more than two decades thrashing the baddies and inevitably destroying all evil,he has now jumped into politics,with pretty much the same intention. But he acknowledges real politics is not like the movies and the victory of <U+0093>good<U+0094> over <U+0093>evil<U+0094> is not pre-ordained. He admits he has not been able to build a real organisation,is not sure if his politics is anything like the Robin Hood socialism that many of his movies portrayed,but between Chandrababu Naidu and Rajasekhar Reddy he seems to know who is the greater <U+0093>evil<U+0094>,even if he won<U+0092>t say so in so many words. Reddy,he says,started out so poor he had to mortgage his house to contest the first time. Now,he has <U+0093>so many houses.<U+0094> And Naidu? <U+0093>Don<U+0092>t ask me to use a word I do not want to use,<U+0094> he says. Then,chin up,eyes rolling to the far corner of the ceiling,lips puckered in an outrage that crores of his fans understand,love,and instantly share,he pronounces: <U+0093>Jackal!<U+0094> (Pronounced,rather more dramatically,as Jauckaaal.) Now I do not know if in Telugu sub-culture the Jackal was Foxier than its more-maligned cousin elsewhere in the country,but maybe it is the name of some serial villain in Telugu movies,much like Kulbhushan Kharbanda<U+0092>s immortal Shakaal in Bollywood <U+0097> and if you watch Telugu movies,and know this to be true,please do send me a mail. Reading the walls may be easier,and safer,than reading politicians<U+0092> lips,but you can sometimes try their body language. The same politicians who maintain,even when counting trends indicate a rout,that they are going to win in the end,will always tell you <U+0097> if you have an experienced eye <U+0097> with their body language if they sense trouble or joy. Body language sometimes also tells you what<U+0092>s working for them and what isn<U+0092>t. The two incumbent chief ministers we meet on this long drive,Yeddiyurappa of Karnataka and Rajasekhar Reddy of Andhra both have the look-feel of politicians who know they are doing fine. For Reddy,what<U+0092>s working is his <U+0093>schemes<U+0094>,and he dismisses with a wave of the hand a suggestion that Naidu<U+0092>s cash-transfer may be finding traction with the poor. <U+0093>He has no credibility,<U+0094> he says,<U+0093>I do not even need to counter it.<U+0094> But he knows what is also working for him is the Chiranjeevi factor. He is taking away most of his anti-incumbency vote which,in a way,is drawing away the venom to save his life. Because if the same vote had gone to Naidu,he would have been looking at a real disaster. For five years,he has been the Congress party<U+0092>s most effective chief minister,and undoubtedly the one most autonomous of the high command. There are charges of corruption wherever you go,but nobody calls him incompetent. What you invariably hear is that he may <U+0093>have made ten rupees for himself,but they all doÖ the difference is,he has also passed at least four to us,the people.<U+0094> In the Congress tradition,YSR is an unusual chief minister, almost sui generis,seeking votes in his own name and for his performance. Of course he more than adequately compensates the First Family by naming almost anything his government,or sometimes even a private company (like the new cricket stadium in Hyderabad),builds after a Nehru or a Gandhi. The other one confidently on a winning course is Yeddiyurappa. But he is still more childlike in his earnestness,even innocence. You ask him,who is the second-most popular leader in Karnataka <U+0097> after him,of course. He is stumped for once,then pauses to recover and then gives you politically the most <U+0093>correct<U+0094> answer: Ananth Kumar,his BJP comrade and one that political correspondents would describe as his <U+0093>bete noire<U+0094>,as if that was his second name. Now don<U+0092>t read Yeddiyurappa<U+0092>s lips. Watch his eyes and cheeks,and catch that smirk. Or read his entire face,as it lights up,and hands,as they go tossing up in excitement,when you ask him which issue is really working for him this campaign and he tells you,with joy of the kind he will learn to hide as he spends more time in power: <U+0093>terrorism<U+0094>. But hang on,we started this saying we found wisdom from writings on the wall. So let us go back to one,at a dhaba on National Highway 5 at a place called Hanuman Junction,not far from Eluru. The owner,a woman,is a Kamma,a TDP voter and has a picture of NTR by the cash box. The three employees who serve us a brilliant meal of rice,sambhar and curries will all vote Congress and nobody is threatening to fire them. On the wall of the dining area are three framed pictures,each representing a faith: Lord Balaji,the Ka<U+0092>aba with a night-time crescent moon and Jesus on the crucifix,all together. Sure enough,one thing that is not an issue in this election in Andhra Pradesh is religion or communalism. If that <U+0097> albeit happy <U+0097> writing on the wall won<U+0092>t teach you something about Indian democracy,the mind of the voter in real India,what else would? Postscript: I can<U+0092>t conclude a report from the roadside without listing my favourite reading of all. We leave the KCP Sugar Mill<U+0092>s campus 40 km from Vijayawada after listening to a group of richer,progressive farmers who complain about NREGA having taken away their labour,and find,in a town of maybe 50,000,<U+0093>Mother Teresa Dance Academy<U+0094>.

828,"If all goes as planned, Pimpri-Chinchwad may soon get an image makeover, with overflowing garbage containers and filth strewn all over creating health hazards becoming a thing of past. The civic body has decided to start door-to-door collection of garbage in three to four monthsí time, bringing to an end indiscriminate dumping of garbage in the open by the locals. To begin with, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has decided to distribute as many as 9 lakh 10-litre garbage bins across the industrial town. Each household is set to get two bins, one to store dry waste and the other for wet garbage. ìThe garbage bins, in white and green colours, will be distributed free of cost,î said Municipal Commissioner Shrikar Pardeshi. He said once the garbage bins were distributed in the next three to four months, the sight of garbage being dumped indiscriminately will become rare. ìWe are laying emphasis on door-to-door collection of garbage. Each household will have to store the garbage in the bins given to them. Civic vehicles then collect it daily from them,î he said. PCMC officials said the they were determined to resolve the problem of garbage, which is going to increase with the expansion of the city and its rising population. To effectively handle the problem of garbage, Pardeshi said, PCMC would implement the Sustainable Management of Solid Waste plan under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. ìOnce this plan is implemented, we are sure the garbage problem will be minimised to a large extent,î he said. Under the plan, the PCMC plans to segregate dry and wet garbage and recycle them. Civic officials said PCMC planned to recycle the garbage, generate biogas, manure and use it for vermicompost. However, he said, it would take some time for the plan to take effect. Even as it is planning to ensure effective garbage management, the PCMC is also faced with the problem pertaining to lace of garbage dumping site, with the Moshi depot bursting at the seams. For the last few years, PCMC has been looking at an alternative site but has not been able to locate one. However, officials said, they had zeroed in a piece of land in Punawale area. ìWe have actually paid the amount for it, and are now awaiting the state governmentís nod,î said PCMC sanitation chief R B Chavan. The civic chief also denied the PCMC was looking at shifting the garbage depot because of its proximity to the proposed Chakan international airport. ìThe Moshi depot will remain where it is. The depot is not in the funnel zone of the proposed airport,î he said. Chavan said if the Punawale depot got the green signal from the state government, it would reduce the transportation problem and expenditure. ìPimpri-Chinchwad is expanding in all parts. Carrying garbage from one corner to another is leading to rise in transportation cost. Also, it leads to waste of time and energy because of the growing congestion on the roads,î he said. Chavan said they planned to use the latest technology while developing the new garbage depot, which would cause little harm to†environment. Meanwhile, residents of Pimpri-Chinchwad have been grumbling that the civic body has over the years failed to tackle the problem of garbage disposal. ìEven though the city remains in the grip of dengue, swine flu and a host of other ailments, you will find overflowing garbage containers in every suburbs,î said civic activist Sachin Godambe. ìWhat is shocking is even the trees along the highway have become home for garbage ó plastic bags, bottles, tryes and what notÖ Just look beneath these decorative plants and trees along the Pune-Mumbai highway, garbage has been piling up for months,î said Jayant Kariya, a resident of Dapodi. Civic officials said they cleared maximum garbage from beneath these decorative plants last month. ìOur vehicles made 40 rounds to lift the garbage that had remained there for months,î said an official. The scene at HA grounds in Pimpri is equally shocking. Mounds of garbage line the compound wall and has remained untouched for months. It is clear that locals are indiscriminately dumping the garbage without any check. HA officials, too, seemed to care little. Last week, PCMC officials, however, said they had issued a notice to the HA, which promised to clean up the place. Sachin Rangdal of Bhosari said: ìIt is amazing to find that the PCMC sanitation staff work only till afternoon. Who will clear the garbage after that? Canít PCMC make its staff work in two shifts? Actually, it is in the afternoon and evening hours when all the garbage starts piling up,î he said. To this, officials said once the new system was in place, these complaints would disappear.","Pimpri-Chinchwad can soon breathe easy, civic body set to make door-to-door garbage collection a norm | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pimpri-chinchwad-can-soon-breathe-easy-civic-body-set-to-make-door-to-door-garbage-collection-a-norm/
829,"Summary. Related. The family members of Monika More, who lost both her hands in a railway accident on January 11, received calls from 60 people Wednesday who offered them financial assistance for her treatment, following media reports on Monikaís condition. Within two days, the family has received Rs.1.5 lakh, of which Rs 57, 000 was directly transferred to the bank account opened by Monikaís father Ashok Baban More to raise funds for his daughter. ìWe are overwhelmed with the support that we have received. Even college students have been calling us. I was also told that Monikaís condition was shared on Facebook,î said Vishwas Jadhav, Monikaís maternal uncle. A third year sociology student of Somaiya college called up the family and offered them the money that the students had planned to spend on a picnic. ìHe told me he will also organise a street play at his college and collect money for Monika,î said Jadhav. Three train-commuter groups have also come forward to financially help the family. While two of the groups have taken the bank account details to transfer money, the third group visited Monika at the hospital and donated money for her prosthetics. ìWe are grateful to people and the media for reporting Monikaís story,î said Jadhav. ìMy wife read about Monika in the papers and she asked me to meet the family and offer financial help,î said Sameer Patil, a technical consultant from Haffkine Institute. He visited Monika at KEM hospital. Monika has not just received financial assistance. According to Jadhav, a few amputees spoke to Monika over phone and narrated their success stories. ìIt is a big morale boost for her,î added Jadhav. Monikaís cousin Ganesh said everyone in the family is trying to keep her distracted. However, the family is still apprehensive about the funds as a prosthetic limb will cost between Rs 25-30 lakh. While NGO Yuva Prathisthan had assured help for getting an electronic hand for Monika, Jadhav said they are waiting till her medical parameters normalise. Dr Shubhangi Parkar, acting dean at KEM hospital, said, ìHer condition has improved a lot since she was admitted. However, she will have to wait for another two to three months to get a prosthetic limb.î Meanwhile, a private company approached Monikaís parents with the idea of 3-D printing technology for creating a prosthetic limb. However, Dr Saurabh Hiren, orthopedic surgeon at KEM, said, ìSince the technology is new, we will have to discuss it thoroughly before deciding on it.î","Help pours in for Monikaís treatment, kin get Rs 1.5 lakh | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/help-pours-in-for-monikas-treatment-kin-get-rs-1-5-lakh/
830,"Related. A new section in the Development Control Regulations (DCR) that solely focuses on repairs and reconstruction of existing structures in the city, instead of redevelopment, is one of the major demands put forward by stakeholders at the public consultative workshop Tuesday for the upcoming Mumbai Development Plan (DP) 2014-2034. At the meeting, coordinated by the Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI), as part of BMCís intiative to include public opinion in its vision plan for the next 20 years, urban planners and architects mooted regulations that incentivise such repairs. These suggestion are to encourage the preservation of the cityís existing cultural and historical fabric. Urban designer Rupali Gupte said, ì Historically, Mumbai has generated different types of housing of incredible cultural value. Today the stress is on maximising built-up space though historically open spaces, balconies and intermediate terrace spaces have facilitated spill-outs of larger circulation in common spaces. To enhance the quality of life along with development, the new DP and DCR must not compromise on setback spaces. In fact a separate DCR that only deals with repairs, retrofitting and upgradation of existing structures (based on the same FSI) should be created to encourage people to come forward for repairs.î Conservation architect Vikas Dilawari said, ìOf the 60,000-odd cessed structures in the island city, over 5,000 are more than a century-old. The governmentís various urban renewal and redevelopment schemes with bonus FSI have only encouraged redevelopment, rather than repairs of such historic buildings. This has led to the transformation of heritage precincts into ugly urban sprawls.î He proposed that as part of the incentives for repairs, Transferred Redevelopment Rights, similar to those granted for redevelopment, must be given to owners and tenants of heritage structures. ìThe heritage committee has proposed a list of incentives that include TDR for preserving heritage structures.

A Bombay High Court bench comprising Justice Naresh Patil and Justice V L Achliya may recuse itself from hearing an application, which demands that the CBI should make former state CM Shivajirao Nilangekar-Patil an accused in the Adarsh Housing Society scam.

832,"Related. In a bid to improve urban planning for the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to set up a separate urban planning department soon. With the civic body currently in the process of drafting the cityís new development plan (DP) for 2014-34, the proposed department will ensure that the policies and proposals for the cityís infrastructure are properly planned and implemented. The department, which was first mooted as part of the BMCís budget plans, is expected to take off within a month. Apart from civic officials it will also include experts from the housing sector, environmental planning and the traffic department, among others. According to the Urban Development Plan Formulation & Implementation (UDPFI) guidelines issued by the Ministry of Urban Development, each civic body is required to have a department dedicated to perform the functions of spatial planning. Spatial planning relates to making and implementing decisions on locations and distribution of land use. It is of great importance in a city like Mumbai, which have limited land resources to be distributed for public and private purposes, thereby affecting the quality of life of citizens, said a civic official. The proposal to set up a separate urban planning cell also includes creating a systematic GIS (Geograhic Information System) database with accurate large-scale maps and multi-dimensional data of land use, population pattern etc. ìSuch spatially organised data would have potential for helping and monitoring other sectoral plans such as education, health, fire protection etc,î Municipal Commissioner Sitaram Kunte had said in his budget speech for 2013-14. ìAs part of this urban planning cell, a full fledged GeoSpatial Data Infrastructure cell is also being planned, which will facilitate creating and maintaining of updated GIS database including utilities mapping underneath roads to meet all the data requirements regarding land use and to augment in monitoring developments in the city,î the commissioner had said. According to a preparatory studies report recently prepared by the BMC, the city needs to free up to 46.65 sq km (equivalent to over 10 per cent of its size of 458.28 sq km) for health, education, social amenities and open space requirement for its residents over the next 20 years. The 280-page report, jointly drafted by BMC and Group SCE India Ltd, a 100 per cent subsidiary of French consulting firm EGIS Geoplan, was submitted to Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan in November last year.

833,"Germany's head coach Markus Weiss says that rigour of playing match after match with little time for training and even less for rest hurts players. The most noteworthy aspect of the Aam Aadmi Partyís manifesto is the explicit focus on service delivery. This is what its government will be evaluated on, and attention has shifted from the AAPís political success to how it will deliver on these promises. The ideas below reflect learnings from over a decade of research into public service delivery in India, and may be useful to consider as the AAP works towards translating the priorities in its manifesto into specific policies. One, bringing fiscal transparency. The AAP has revolutionised election financing in India by its transparent approach to fundraising and election expenditure. It now has a great opportunity to do the same for public finances more broadly. It can transform the nature of policy discourse in India by creating a webpage that makes it easy for citizens to drill down into the details of the income and spending of the Delhi government by department, by constituency/ ward and by position in the income distribution (the latter will take some analysis, but is doable). A simple tool like this can increase the transparency of government spending, improve accountability by building citizen awareness of public spending in their area, and act as an internal compass for the AAP to check whether a proposed policy is going to benefit the true aam aadmi, as opposed to more vocal (and typically better off) interest groups. Such a tool can also elevate the standards of public policy discourse by highlighting the tradeoffs involved in policymaking. Two, rethinking prices and subsidies. The main objective of subsidies should be to help the poor. But unfortunately, most subsidies in India are highly regressive because a fixed subsidy per unit of consumption leads to a larger fiscal subsidy for those who consume more (who are the better off). If the goal is to help the aam aadmi, a better approach to utility pricing would be to subsidise consumption up to a fixed number of units (at, say, the current consumption of the 80th percentile of users) and to price units above that at market cost. Such an approach is much more pro-aam aadmi and sustainable because economic growth will reduce the subsidy burden as a fraction of revenue. In contrast, a flat subsidy would increase the subsidy bill over time, disproportionately benefit the better off and crowd out resources needed for more pro-poor investments. Three, enforcing service provider accountability. It is tempting to think that the main reason for poor quality public health and education is the lack of facilities and inputs, but careful empirical research over the past decade has consistently shown that the key constraint to quality is the low effort and motivation of public service providers. The AAP has correctly identified the fundamental challenge of governance as being that voters are only heard once every five years, and not in between elections. In particular, they have no voice over the conduct of the police, teachers and doctors who are meant to serve them, but are ìpermanentî government employees and not accountable to the communities they serve. Recent research estimates the fiscal cost of tea-cher absence in India to be Rs 9,000 crore a year. If this is not corruption, what is? So instead of building new schools and hospitals, it would be much more effective to focus on increasing both top-down administrative monitoring as well as bottom-up community monitoring of performance in existing facilities. Research also suggests that an across the board ìregularisationî of contract workers is unlikely to improve service delivery, while leaving taxpayers with an inflated wage bill. While worker rights are important, it would be good to consider approaches that balance these rights with the needs for accountability. One option may be to consider longer-term contracts (of, say, three years at a time) with pension contributions, but where hiring and renewal is decided by the community. This is consistent with the principles laid out in ìSwarajî (the AAP manifesto), but the worry is that the politically difficult ìlocal accountabilityî goal will be lost, while the politically easy ìregularisationî will take place first. Governments do not have a permanent job, and are accountable to voters for renewal. Why not apply the same approach to public employees and the communities that they serve? Four, making a distinction between public goods versus public-provision of private goods. In prioritising limited financial and administrative resources, it is useful to go back to a basic but often forgotten concept of public economics ó the distinction between true public goods and publicly provided private goods. Examples of the former include law and order, justice, regulation, infrastructure, public health and sewage/ sanitation. These are (a) best provided by the state for reasons of jurisdiction or natural economies of scale/ scope, and (b) benefit everyone because there are large (positive) externalities to all. The latter include areas like healthcare, education and food security, which tend to be provided by the state for access/ normative reasons, but which can, in principle, be (and in practice are) provided more effectively by the private market. So the AAP should try to focus maximum attention on the public goods that only government can provide, and be willing to experiment with models that leverage the strengths of the private sector for service delivery in other areas. Five, enhancing choice and competition in service delivery. Research on both health and education in India has shown that the private sector delivers equal or better quality than the public sector at much lower levels of per capita spending. So, while the AAP should focus on improving public service delivery (the private sector will also have to improve in response), it will do well to listen to citizens who are voting with their feet and choosing fee-charging private options over the free public ones. Of course, in some cases, the public options are better and in others, the private ones are, but citizens can usually judge quality better than bureaucrats. So, policy should worry less about public vs private, and more about choice and competition and empowering the aam aadmi with vouchers that allow her to take the per capita spending that the government is incurring in her name and avail the best option for her.† Such an approach will empower the aam aadmi with choices similar to those available to the better off, and encourage improvements in service delivery in both the public and private sectors. The AAP has shown a commendable willingness to not micro-manage the way money for the poor is spent and instead provide them greater autonomy (untied funds to mohalla sabhas, for instance). The spirit of ìSwarajî should be extended to service delivery to the extent possible by ensuring genuine community control over service providers, and empowering voters to spend the public money that is being spent in their names in ways that they see fit. By being transparent about public expenditure and the trade-offs involved in policy choices; by being vigilant against policies that cater to the interests of the vocal top 20 per cent at the cost of the poor; by prioritising financial and administrative resources effectively; and by being open to using both state and market means to achieve pro-poor ends (as Yogendra Yadav recently said it was), the AAP government can transform service delivery in Delhi and beyond.

835,"Germany's head coach Markus Weiss says that rigour of playing match after match with little time for training and even less for rest hurts players. The Left in India has lost touch with the instincts and knowledges on which it has traditionally based its theoretical and practical positions. There is the usual frenzy of punditry as India approaches its elections. Almost all of it begins with the expression of a widespread feeling that the Congress has finally petered out of energy, lost its capacity for innovative policymaking as well as the drive of its leadership (of the sort that Sonia Gandhi surprised everyone by unleashing in the 2004 elections), and has revealed, more than ever before, its susceptibility to the lucre of corruption. The chatter then moves to discussing the excitement offered by the alternatives of Narendra Modi (waiting to outflank the Congress from the right with policies ó if that can be imagined ó even more neoliberal than those of Manmohan Singh and his economic advisors), or of the Aam Aadmi Party (with its promise of little more than the end of corruption and the reduction of the cost of some necessities), or of the various other more familiar regional parties. Chiming in is the speculation about the principled and unprincipled coalitional possibilities that the election results are bound to generate. It is not easy in the midst of this noise, which I am not wholly deriding for it is part of the noise of democracy, to keep oneís eye focused on the more fundamental issues at stake. After all, democracy, in the substantial sense of the term, is the role played by the people of a country in shaping the decisions that affect the fundamental aspects of their material and spiritual lives. Representative politics is one important element that allows them to do this, and elections are the procedural path by which representation in governance is established. Given this dialectical relation between the substance and procedure of democracy, two crucial questions arise: Is what is on offer to ordinary people in elections addressing the fundamental aspects of their lives? And are ordinary people cognitively well prepared to assess the options on offer to them in a way that will promote what they wish for their material and spiritual wellbeing? It is only when these two questions are affirmatively answered that one can be assured that the procedures of democracy will yield its substance as an outcome. Letís take the first question. In the United States, where I am domiciled, very little that makes for fundamental change in peopleís lives gets onto the agenda of what is on offer in electoral politics. The two parties in the political arena merely represent competing ìpower elitesî, to use a term of C. Wright Mills, and any basic opposition to this consensus of elite (mostly corporate) power has always come not from policies creatively formulated in the corridors of power by elected leaders, but from movements on the street which have occasionally forced elected leaders to make important changes ó such as the labour movements of the 1930s or the civil rights and womenís movements of a few decades later. India, by contrast, has the distinct advantage of having a multiparty political system and so, even if there is a consensus among two of the major parties, there are others which may present alternatives outside the consensus, so long as the people are cognitively prepared to see the merit in the alternatives and their minds are not entirely shaped by the ideologies and ways of thinking underlying the consensus itself. That brings us to the second question. The outcome of the 2004 elections in India is a telling example of what is at issue here. It is known that in the months prior to that election, pundits in the print and televised media were cheerleading for the utterly illusory claims of an emergent India under the policies that the government had been pursuing. Yet the government was defeated. In a sense, then, the mass of our people were saved by a combination of their illiteracy (the illusion of ìIndia Shiningî afflicted only the literate metropolitan classes who were cognitively fed by the media) and their knowledge of the causes of their own impoverished conditions, thereby revealing that everyday political knowledge and media literacy are by no means the same thing. Cognitive preparedness for democratic participation depends on such political knowledge, not attentiveness to the expertise of editorialists and think-tanks. And in this regard too, the US is worse off because the mainstream media there ó both the highbrow national media and the local tabloids ó controlled as it is by large corporate conglomerates, more or less entirely shapes the political cognition of the mass of ordinary people. On both questions, then, the US fares badly. And to hark back to the distinction I had made earlier, that is why the outcomes of the procedural aspects of its democracy seldom serve its substantial aspect well, as a result of which the fundamental interests of ordinary people are poorly reflected in election outcomes. If, as Iíve suggested, on both these questions, India seems to be better off in the prospects for a substantial democracy, why is it that one is nevertheless stricken by a pessimism about the months ahead? I think the answer lies in the tragic weakness of the only parties ó the parties of the Left ó that do address the most fundamental questions about the lives of ordinary people. To begin with, there is the internecine rift between the insurgent left and the organised left, with the former committed only to the substantial aspects of democracy without any respect for the procedural path to its achievement, replacing it instead with some fantasy of mobilisation that is supposed to be inspired by isolated acts of violence, which often even target the organised left. On the other hand, there is the disarray of the organised left, defeated in the states in which it recently possessed power. The hard question is: what is the deepest source of its current weakness? If the pundits are to be believed in their constant scorn of the CPM, it is because the organised left is committed nostalgically to a conception of political economy that is several decades out of date. But the opposite is true; the real source of its weakness has been its refusal to keep faith with its own avowed commitment to the fundamental interests of ordinary people and to have instead embraced, to a considerable extent (especially in Bengal), the aspirations of the Congress and the BJP. It remains a matter of as yet unanalysed importance what compelled a left party in power to abandon the policies it had traditionally been committed to, some of which (such as the early land reforms) had given it such lasting success for some decades. What in Centre-state relations, that is to say what, under the neoliberal dispensation adopted by the Centre, has compelled states to compete with each other for the delusional gains of such economic policies for their regions? This is a question that needs to be carefully analysed. The left must find a theoretical as well as practical stance against what generates these compulsions. Nothing else could revive the strength of the left in the regions where it still has some influence and allow it to grow in other remgions of the country; and, in turn, nothing else could improve the prospects of a substantial democracy in India. I donít doubt that what I have briefly said here will be dismissed as nostalgia for a politics of a bygone age. But there is nothing nostalgic about it. The outcome of the elections in 2004 showed that the people were appealing to their current instincts and quotidian political knowledges (not any bygone ideology) to reject the charms of a neoliberal political economy. It is those instincts and knowledges on which the left has traditionally constructed (and must continue to construct) its theoretical and practical stances. And, in any case, we must not forget that the most creative minds and practitioners in the Renaissance who eventually triumphed were dismissed by mediaeval scholars for being afflicted by a nostalgia for a bygone classical age.

A fortnight after the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power in Delhi, BJPís prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi Sunday betrayed unease over its attempt to spread wings outside Delhi in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls by sparing a part of his usual anti-Congress tirade to slam the new partyís attempt to emerge as a national alternative. While he did not name either Kejriwal or AAP in his address at a public rally here, Modi attacked the new party for questioning the BJPís credentials and said that it did not have experience and vision to run the country. He virtually accused the media of exaggerating the AAPís credentials and not looking beyond Delhi. Modi gave the examples of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar ó as well as his own humble origins ó to take a dig at Kejriwal and projected the AAP as a shield for the Congress. ìThere are some who are questioning the BJPís credentials.

In fact, he began his speech praising the ìsimplicity, honesty and commitmentî of Parrikar to underline how the BJP always promoted such people. ìOne should know the honesty and simplicity of the chief minister here. Had Manohar Parrikar been in Delhi, the entire country would have known about this educated person who has remained so simple. Unfortunately, he is in Goa. The media cannot look beyond Delhi. There are many such gems across the country,î Modi said. †BJP chief Rajnath Singh too praised Parrikar. Dismissing the AAPís projection in the media, Modi said, ìThe country has to decide whether what looks on the TV are for their good or the visions that has been delivered on ground is for their good.î He said he remained unfazed by the media projection of AAP and expressed confidence that he will emerge the winner. ìI have always lost on TV screens and newspapers, but I have never lost in the hearts of people,î he said. The BJPís prime ministerial candidate then returned to his tirade against the Congress, targeting former environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan and Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in particular. ìFiles (for clearances) used to be held back for money in the Environment Ministry. Then, for the first time we heard, there was something called ëJayanthi Taxí in Delhi. Files in the Environment Ministry would not budge unless ëJayanthi Taxí was paid,î Modi said, accusing the former minister of rent-seeking for environmental clearances to projects. ìAn economy need infrastructure, human resource and raw materials to sustain. If raw materials remain locked and Delhi keeps mum, who will save Goa from ruins.î ìIt is only a matter of few months for those who have suffered. We will protect the environment and also bring transparency in mining to help develop mining,î Modi promised Goa, which according to Parrikar has lost about 25 per cent of the stateís revenue for curbs on mining. He attacked Shinde for ìvote-bank politicsî, referring to his remarks that he had written to the CMs to form panels to review terror cases involving Muslim youths. ìShouldnít each criminal be treated on a par? But look at the audacity of the Home Minister. For vote-bank politics, he has written (to CMs) cautioning against arrest of Muslims. All innocent, irrespective of religion, should get justice.î ìLaw and order is a state subject and you (Shinde) have no right to give a sermon to states on this count,î Modi said.

A rally to be addressed by Rahul in Amethi on the same ground, two days before Vishwasís, was postponed at the last minute citing waterlogging at the venue. Addressing Sundayís rally, Sanjay Singh too termed the fight ìthe second freedom struggleî and attacked dynasties from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu, while Ashutosh urged people to be ìa part of the revolutionî.†Azmi predicted that Kumar would win by a margin of one lakh votes. ìWish you had asked him (Rahul) why only 20 per cent of Amethiís roads are constructed, why Nehruís 1954 promise of an Unchahar-Salon-Amethi railway line is still a promise, why over 500 villages have to suffer because a bridge in Shankerganj is broken for the last two years,î Vishwas asked in his speech. ìGoing to a Dalitís house and having dinner wonít do, Rahulji. The job of a parliamentarian is to worry if all Dalits are sleeping on full stomachs.î Also attacking Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Vishwas said that when she doesnít trust the sons of India for her treatment and goes to foreign countries, how can the people of Amethi and the country trust her son. Kumar and his cavalcade of about 150 vehicles faced sporadic protests as they drove to Amethi from Lucknow. In Inhona, around 50 Muslim youths showed him black flags. They claimed they didnít belong to any party or organisation and that Vishwas had hurt their sentiments by making derogatory remarks against Hazrat Imam Hussain. At Jagdishpur, ink was thrown at his vehicle while he was at a girlsí college, while later stones were pelted at it. Rickshawpullers queued up ìin supportî of the Congress, while Congress workers at Gauriganj waved flags and asked Vishwas to return. Stones were allegedly also hurled at buses ferrying party workers, damaging panes. Vishwas brought up the issue of attacks again and again in his speech, terming them reflection of the ìfrustrationî of rival parties. ìThey are mistaken if they think that ink and eggs and sticks and stones will scare us,î he said. Calling the protests ìsponsoredî, the AAP leader added: ìWhy they are doing so? Is Amethi a separate country, where I need a passport for visiting?î However, Vishwas added, he was sorry ìif any of my comments have hurt anyoneís sentimentsî.

838,"Related. With CM Vijay Bahuguna likely to be replaced this month, the fight for the Uttarakhand Chief Ministerís post seems to have narrowed down to Union Minister Harish Rawat and Uttarakhand minister Pritam Singh, though some other names are doing the rounds. Party sources said Rawat is a frontrunner, surprisingly so since the party high command was said to be keen on a younger face, and a neutral leader who could rein in factionalism. Sources said the leadership change would be carried out after the three-day Assembly session which ends on January 16. Rawat ó who lost to Bahuguna in the race for CM in 2012 ó has been in pursuit of the post but the party high command had not been enthusiastic as it was felt it could intensify factionalism in the deeply divided state unit of the party and render the government unstable. Besides, it was in favour of a younger face. Sources said Rawat is being considered a top contender. Party leaders said the Union Water Resources Minister ó who was elected as the first PCC president of Uttarakhand after its formation ó has reportedly pleaded with the leadership that this could be his last shot at the spot and he should be rewarded for his loyalty. A section of the leadership found merit in his argument. Rawat, despite leading the party to victory in 2002 Assembly elections as the PCC chief had to make way for N D Tiwari. He was sidelined again in 2012, when Vijay Bahuguna became CM. After that, Rawat had sulked. He was made a cabinet minister later. Sources said it could be a close fight between Rawat and Pritam Singh although there are others including state Finance Minister†Indira Hridayesh, who are trying to get the post. Hridayesh surprised many by openly staking claim to the top post. Pritam Singh, ironically, belongs to the Rawat camp and sources said he could emerge as a compromise candidate if the anti-Rawat factions refuse to accept him.

As BSP chief Mayawati prepares to sound the poll bugle with a rally in Lucknow on January 15, her 58th birthday, her close aide Satish Chandra Misra dismisses the idea of a third front and speculations about a tie-up with the Congress. Excerpts from an interview he gave to D K Singh: There has been a buzz in political circles about the likelihood of a Congress-BSP tie up for the Lok Sabha elections. Is it true? (Laughs) I too have been reading about my meetings with Congress leaders. When I checked my schedule on the day I was supposed to have met Sonia Gandhi, I was in Lucknow at a family function.† Somehow, I donít seem to know about these meetings. How can we have any talks with any party when itís a policy decision of the BSP to go it alone in the elections? We are going to contest all 543 seats. You will perhaps be convinced after hearing behnji on January 15. The Congress does not have minority votes. Muslims are 100 per cent with the BSP and they are going to vote for us. Even the majority community is totally with us. We donít believe in such divisions.†† For five years, we ensured equal participation (in governance) of all castes, classes and communities. We ensured that there was not even a minor skirmish, leave alone 135 communal riots (as) in the past one-and-a-half years. The Congress took no action against the (Samjawadi Party) government (over the Muzaffarnagar riots) though they are in power at the Centre. There is total breakdown of law and order in Uttar Pradesh, but the Congress never considered the option of Presidentís rule. They talk about ISI operations and put a blot on people who are already in tents getting no medicines, no food. The Congress has always had a tacit understanding with the SP. What makes you so confident after you lost the last assembly elections in UP heavily? We did not lose badly. In fact, we got 38 lakh more votes in 2012 than in 2007. In about 100 seats, we lost by less than 2,000 votes. What really worked against us was the fact that both the Congress and the BJP turned out to be zero. How does your party look at the BJPís prime ministerial candidate? And how do you expect the Narendra Modi factor to play out in UP? There are many candidates (for the prime ministerís post) in the BJP and they should first decide it themselves. As for Modi, he will have no impact in UP. The Samajwadi Party has been at the forefront of an attempt to forge a sort of third front ahead of the elections. Why has the BSP stayed out of all this? Third front is a joke. When you donít know who will get how many seats, how can you talk about it? First you see what percentage marks you get in different subjects and only then should you think of choosing science or whatever stream.","ëThird front is a jokeÖ first see marks, then choose streamí | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/third-front-is-a-joke-first-see-marks-then-choose-stream/

Launching his Lok Sabha election campaign here at a ëJan Vishwas Rallyí, the Aam Aadmi Partyís (AAP) likely candidate against Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Kumar Vishwas, told Amethi on Sunday to join ìthe revolutionî, adding ìThe nation is calling, come with us, there is nothing left in these (political) families.î Announcing that he had applied for an AAP ticket from Amethi, Vishwas said: ìI have not come here for a win or loss. My only concern is that when the sons of my daughter ask me 20 years later where I was at the time of Indiaís second revolution for freedom, I can tell them I was on the streets, facing lathis, under the Tricolour, for the revolution.î He added that there was a possibility of him getting killed ìin the next three monthsî. Attacking Rahul, Vishwas said: ìI have come here because Rahulji, the people of Amethi sent you (to Parliament), but in 10 years, you havenít asked a single question and your presence there was minimum. Whenever there was an issue, be it the rape of a six-year-old girl, 2G, Coalgate, Commonwealth Games, we kept waiting for you to speak.î Instead of voting for such ìyuvraj, maharani, rajkumar and maharajasî, Vishwas said, Amethi should free itself of ìthe clutches of dynastyî and this time ìselect a servant and tell him to take their word to Parliamentî. AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Ilyas Azmi and journalist-turned-politician Ashutosh were present at the rally. While Singh too termed the fight ìthe second freedom struggleî and attacked dynasties from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu, Ashutosh urged people to be ìa part of the revolutionî. Azmi ìpredictedî that Kumar would win by a margin of one lakh votes. ìWish you had asked him (Rahul) why only 20 per cent of Amethiís roads are constructed, why Nehruís 1954 promise of an Unchahar-Salon-Amethi railway line is still a promise, why over 500 villages have to suffer because a bridge in Shankerganj is broken for the last two years,î Vishwas asked in his speech. ìGoing to a Dalitís house and having dinner wonít do, Rahulji. The job of a parliamentarian is to worry if all Dalits are sleeping on full stomachs.î Also attacking Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Vishwas said that when she doesnít trust the sons of India for her treatment and goes to foreign countries, how can the people of Amethi and the country trust her son. Kumar and his cavalcade of about 150 vehicles faced sporadic protests as they drove to Amethi from Lucknow. In Inhona, around 50 Muslim youths showed him black flags. They claimed they didnít belong to any party or organisation and that Vishwas had hurt their sentiments by making derogatory remarks against Hazrat Imam Hussain. At Jagdishpur, ink was thrown at his vehicle while he was at a girlsí college, while later stones were pelted at it. Rickshawpullers queued up ìin supportî of the Congress, while Congress workers at Gauriganj waved flags and asked Vishwas to return. Stones were allegedly also hurled at buses ferrying party workers, damaging panes. Vishwas brought up the issue of attacks again and again in his speech, terming them reflection of the ìfrustrationî of rival parties. ìThey are mistaken if they think that ink and eggs and sticks and stones will scare us,î he said. Calling the protests ìsponsoredî, the AAP leader added: ìWhy they are doing so? Is Amethi a separate country where I need a passport for visiting?î However, Vishwas added, he was sorry ìif any of my comments have hurt anyoneís sentimentsî. To his own supporters, he instructed, never raise hands in attack and hug people instead. When two more protesters showed black flags at the rally on Amethiís Ramlila grounds, Vishwas asked ìthe Congressmenî to be called up on stage ìso that we can hug them and hear them outî. He added that that he would be staying in Amethi and could meet these protesters at a time and place of their choosing, ìaloneî. Tweaking his poem Koi Deewana Kehta Hai, he said he may have been called a ìjokerî, but only a ìjokerî like him could understand the bechaini (worry) of Amethi. He later recited his poem Tiranga. The local representative of Rahul in Amethi, Chandra Kant Dubey, denied that Congressmen were involved in the protests against Vishwas. ìOur party workers are busy celebrating Vivekanand Jayanti and Priyankaís birthdayÖ None of them were involved in the protests against Vishwas,î PTI quoted him as saying.","Nation calls, join 2nd freedom struggle, Kumar Vishwas tells Amethi | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/nation-calls-join-2nd-freedom-struggle-kumar-vishwas-tells-amethi/

TV footages showed a grim-faced Ershad was sitting on the backseat of the SUV wearing a red sweater as the convoy of police and RAB vans drove off. ìIt is mysterious,I was with him (Ershad) until the eveningÖhe was in good health and also took part in his routine physical exercise,î Ershadís press secretary Sunil Subho Roy told reporters. The former military ruler,who was ousted in a mass upsurge in 1990 after nine years of rule,returned to limelight earlier this month when he announced his party would stay way from the polls due to lack of a proper atmosphere. Ershadís dramatic shift compounded the problems the interim government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a time when the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has also announced it will boycott the polls. His hospitalisation at the secured facility came amid a desperate effort by the Awami League to get the Jatiya Party,wracked with infighting and factional clashes,back to polls if required under the leadership of his wife Raushan,currently a minister in the poll time multi-party cabinet. Hours after his hospitalisation,Ershad wrote to the Election Commission conveying his decision to stay off the polls and requesting it not to grant the partyís ìploughî symbol to anyone. On December 5,Ershad had threatened to kill himself after security forces surrounded his residence. ìI have loaded four pistolsÖI told the government I will kill myself if they play any tricks with me. I will die before the RAB or the police can lay a finger on me,î he had said.","Ex-Bangladesh dictator ëdetainedí,taken to military hospital | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/exbangladesh-dictator-detained-taken-to-military-hospital-2/
853,"Related. Former Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was indicted for murder on Thursday in connection with a deadly military crackdown on mass opposition protests in Bangkok three years ago,prosecutors said. The move comes as fresh political turmoil rocks the Thai capital,with protesters backed by Abhisitís opposition party seeking to oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and rid the kingdom of the influence of her brother,deposed former leader Thaksin. Some observers doubt British-born Abhisit will go to prison given his links to the Thai elite,and see the case as part of the countryís political brinkmanship. Abhisit denied the charges and was freed after posting bail of USD 56,000,his lawyer Bandit Siripan said after the closed-door hearing. ìThe pre-trial hearing is expected on March 24 next year,î he said. Under Abhisitís government,more than 90 people died and nearly 1,900 were wounded in street clashes in the capital in 2010 between mostly unarmed pro-Thaksin ìRed Shirtî demonstrators and security forces firing live rounds. A small group of Red Shirts shouted ìMurderer!î as the Democrat Party leader arrived at court,without speaking to waiting media. There were about 10 Abhisit supporters outside the building,some holding bunches of flowers. Thailand has seen several bouts of political turmoil since Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006,with rival protests sometimes resulting in bloody unrest. Prosecutors have accused Abhisit and his former deputy Suthep Thaugsuban of issuing orders that resulted in murder and attempted murder by the security forces. Oxford-educated Abhisit-who was formally charged in December-insists he is innocent and has described the accusations against him as politically motivated. Suthep,who did not attend todayís hearing,also faces a murder charge but had asked the court to postpone his hearing. The former deputy premier is now spearheading the mass opposition protests against Yingluck,for which he faces an arrest warrant for insurrection. Yingluck has called an early election-set for February 2-to try to calm the political turmoil. But Suthep has rejected the move,demanding the government step aside in favour of an unelected ìpeopleís councilî.",Ex-Thai PM Abhisit indicted for murder over rally crackdown | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/exthai-pm-abhisit-indicted-for-murder-over-rally-crackdown/

Nearly 230 million children under the age of five around the world have never had their birth registered,which often means they will be barred from education,health care and social security,the UN childrenís agency said. A report by UNICEF to mark its 67th birthday on Wednesday said globally that amounts to one in three children under five. Last year,it said,only around 60 percent of all babies born were registered at birth,with the lowest levels of registration in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. UNICEF Deputy Director Geeta Rao Gupta said birth registration not only acknowledges a childís identity and existence but is key ìto guaranteeing that children are not forgotten,denied their rights or hidden from the progress of their nations.î ìBirth registration and a birth certificate is vital for unlocking a childís full potential,î Rao Gupta said adding ìif societies fail to count them,and donít even recognise that they are there,they are more vulnerable to neglect and abuse. Inevitably,their potential will be severely diminished.î UNICEF said failure to count children not only often excludes them from accessing education,health care and social security but affects the development of their communities and countries. It cited many barriers to birth registration,from parents who are unaware of its importance to cultural barriers and fear of the consequences of reporting a birth including the misuse of personal information such as race,religion or birth out of wedlock. It said children living in rural or remote areas,from poor families,and born to uneducated mothers are most likely not to be registered.

The problem of terrorism is complex and rooted in the events of the past three decades,îhaving global,regional and local dimensionsî,he said. ìWe believe that the best way to deal with these challenges is through national consensus,which we are generating through various forums including the All-Parties Conference and parliamentary resolutions,î Sharif said. The CIA-operated drone campaign,which has eliminated several top Taliban and Al Qaeda commanders,has emerged as a key irritant in Pakistan-US relations. Islamabad has opposed the use of the pilotless spy planes,saying they have killed innocent people. Sharif said one of Pakistanís foremost foreign policy priorities is to have good neighbourly,friendly and cooperative relations ìwith all our neighbours including India,based on mutual respect and esteemî. Pakistan is also looking to deepen its cooperation with European partners in key areas like trade,investment,energy,infrastructure,education and human resource development. European countries,as Pakistanís largest trade and investment partners,enjoy a unique position. Sharif said Pakistan is encouraged to see progress towards grant of ìGSP+î status,which is going to be voted on by the European Parliament. ìI know this for a fact that our high hopes about Pakistan winning this status are very strongly founded on the supportive and cooperative role of the resident missions,î he said. He expressed confidence that Pakistanís strengthening relations and efforts by the envoys will stimulate economic growth,curb extremism and promote social stability. He told the envoys that his government has approached internal and external challenges by creating a climate of political tolerance and accommodation. A multi-pronged strategy is being developed to address the countryís crippling energy crisis and a business loan scheme to promote small and medium enterprises had been launched. ìThese interventions will go a long way in creating job opportunities,stimulating growth and improving the quality of our human resource,î he said.

Beijing has rejected Washingtonís appeals as interference in its domestic affairs,and while it says Liu Xiaobo was duly convicted of subversion,it has refused to offer any legal basis for the house arrest of Liu Xia,who friends say has grown despondent at being virtually confined to her apartment for the past three years. On Tuesday,Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said that Liu Xiaobo violated Chinaís laws and deserved to be punished. ìI need to emphasize that only the 1.3 billion Chinese people are best qualified to pass judgment over Chinaís human rights condition,î he said.

Deeply embarrassed,Chinaís government angrily denounced the award and suspended much of its economic and diplomatic contact with Norway,where the prize is awarded. Kerryís statement underscored a desire by the U.S. to be seen as active on Chinese human rights in the face of critics who say the issue is being downgraded because of Washingtonís desire for strong trade ties and Chinese support on knotty diplomatic issues such as the conflict in Syria and Iranís nuclear programs.

A small passenger plane facing engine trouble made an emergency landing on a busy highway in New York City injuring three people on board as the aircraft narrowly missed cars on the road while taxiing. The single-engine plane made an emergency landing on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx yesterday afternoon,officials said. The Piper PA-28 was on its way to Danbury,Connecticut,heading north from the Statue of Liberty when it experienced engine trouble,a spokesman for the Fire Department of New York was quoted as saying by the Wall Street Journal. The pilot planned to land at La Guardia Airport in Queens but realised he would not be able to reach the runway. ìThey couldnít make it and landed on the expressway,î the fire department spokesman said. The pilot and his two women passengers were taken to St Barnabas Hospital with minor injuries. One of the passengers suffered minor head injuries in the landing and was in stable condition,police said. The plane hit some treetops before it landed,officials and witnesses said,spilling some fuel before touching down and rolling about 100 yards down the lane. The pilot was able to land on the usually heavily trafficked expressway because a crew of city workers repairing potholes had closed two northbound lanes,workers at the scene were quoted as saying by the New York Times. After seeing the plane in the air,the crew stopped traffic and closed the third northbound lane. No cars were damaged during the landing,officials said,but there were major delays into the evening as officials investigated.

878,"Summary. Related. Thailandís beleaguered Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra on Monday dissolved parliament and called a snap polls,even as thousands of protesters took to the streets to install a ìPeopleís Councilî to run the country. ìAfter listening to opinions from all sides,I have decided to request a royal decree to dissolve Parliament,î Yingluck said in a televised address. ìThere will be new elections according to the democratic system,î said the 46-year-old prime minister who came to power in 2011. Election Commission (EC) member Sodsri Sattayatham said a general election to elect the 500-seat lower house will be held within 60 days,or before February 2,2014. Under Thai election law,fresh polls must take place in the next 60 days. However,anti-government protesters,who have been calling for Yingluckís government to be replaced with an unelected ìPeopleís Councilî,said the rallies will continue. Protesters accuse the prime minister of acting as a proxy for her fugitive brother and former premier Thaksin Shinwatra. Suthep Thaugsuban,the top leader of the anti-government protests,said demonstrators would ìblow the final whistleî today in an attempt to uproot the ìThaksin influenceî from the country. Over one lakh protesters besieged Government House this morning,prompting the authorities to cancel a plan to invite foreign diplomats to observe the situation there. Yingluck today said she will remain the head of the interim government. ìThe situation seems likely to escalate to violence so the government has decided to return power to the people and let them decide through elections,î she said. However,protest leaders Satit Wongnongtaey and Tavorn Senieum demanded her resignation following House dissolution. Satit told protesters that House dissolution was only the first victory but was not enough for achieving real democracy. He said the anti-government Peopleís Democratic Reform Committee led-by Suthep wants the ìPeopleís Councilî to be formed and the caretaker cabinet to resign. Meanwhile,Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul said he believed Yingluck would run in the next election although she had not yet spoken about it. Protest leaders,most of them †former opposition Democrat MPs,however,said that the setting up of a ìPeopleís Councilî was necessary to ensure that ìThaksin†Regime and its servants will not returnî. Thai interior minister and two deputy prime ministers issued an urgent statement on NBT channel to urge people and student to stop joining the protests and return home. They said protesters should stop for the sake of the country and should protect democracy. The opposition Democrat Party leader and former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva had said its 153 MPs were resigning from the 500-seat lower house ñ a move that does not prevent the ruling Puea Thai party from passing new laws but leaves parliament facing questions about its legitimacy. The Election commissioner has said the Democrat Party MPs who had resigned could register again and contest†the polls. The EC will also cancel the December 22 by-elections to fill eight seats previously left vacant by the resignation of†Democrat MP last month to lead an all-out protest against the Yingluck administration. ìThere will be new elections according to the democratic systemÖThe people will decide what the majority wants and who they want to government the country,î Yingluck said in an effort to defuse the over two-week long crisis.

The judge at the Court of First Instance in Muscat sentenced Mohammed Ali, managing director of Galfar Engineering, to three years in jail and former Galfar business development manager Abdullmajeed Nushad to two years in jail. Ali, who had maintained his innocence throughout the trial that began in November, was also ordered to pay 600,000 rials in fine. Nushad, who had initially denied the charges but changed his plea during the trial, was ordered to pay 200,000 rials, the judge said. Ali and Nushad, who hold Indian citizenship, are to be deported after they serve their sentences. The court also sentenced Juma Al Hinai, an official in the Finance Ministry who also serves as head of the tenders committee at state-owned Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), to three years in jail and levied a fine of 600,000 rials (£946.31 thousand). He was banned from holding public office for 20 years. More than 20 government officials and private executives from Omanís oil industry and related sectors are on trial on charges of offering or accepting bribes in exchange for contracts, mostly in infrastructure projects.

Last seasonís third place was the best Atletico had managed since they won a league and Kingís Cup double in 1996. Current coach Diego Simeone, a former Argentina midfielder who was in the 1996 team, has revived memories of those glory days since he took over at the end of 2011, honing a mean defence and getting the best out of players like forward Diego Costa and midfielder Koke. Atletico, the Kingís Cup holders, have won all their matches at their Calderon stadium this season apart from the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup in August when they drew 1-1 with Barca. Victory on Saturday would put them three points clear of the Catalan giants, while Atleticoís city rivals Real Madrid are five points behind in third and play at Espanyol on Sunday. Koke, who earned a call-up to the Spain squad last year, has played a key role in Atleticoís resurgence, developing a lethal partnership with Costa and netting some important goals, including the winner in Saturdayís 1-0 victory at Malaga.

Officials have adopted an array of measures aimed at halting the attacks,focussing their efforts on resurgent al-Qaeda front groups emboldened by the war raging in neighbouring Syria. Today,a suicide bomber blew himself up at the funeral of an anti-al-Qaeda fighter who had been killed just a day earlier near the restive confessionally mixed city of Baquba. The blast went off at the graveyard in the village of Wajihiyah where the funeral procession,which included relatives and tribesmen,for Mudher al-Shallal al-Araki had planned to bury the militiaman. Overall,12 people were killed and 28 others were wounded,according to a police colonel and Dr Hussein al-Tamimi from a nearby hospital. The 27-year-old had been a fighter in the Sahwa,the militia formed of Sunni tribesmen that,from late 2006 began siding with US forces against their co-religionists in al-Qaeda,helping turn the tide of Iraqís insurgency. But Sunni militants regard them as traitors and often target them for attacks. His father was a leader in the Sahwa,and a sheikh of the Arakiya tribe. Violence west of Baghdad today also killed four other people,officials said. The bloodshed was the latest in a months-long spike in violence that has left more than 6,100 people dead,according to an AFP tally based on security and medical reports. New data from the Iraqi ministries of health,interior and defence,meanwhile showed that 948 people were killed as a result of violence last month-852 civilians,53 policemen and 43 soldiers-while 1,349 others were wounded. The overall monthly toll was marginally down on last monthís multi-year high of 964 but still among the bloodiest months in Iraq since 2008,when the country was slowly emerging from its brutal sectarian war. AFPís tally,meanwhile,also showed a decline in violence,but the overall toll of 692 dead was still among the highest this year.

Bhat admitted that law students seemed to be vulnerable to such incidents as they often intern under influential judges. ìI never received such complaints from my students.

They alleged that the panel sat on the complaint for over five months, although the alleged victim complained to the V-C four times. She later went to the police and filed a complaint, after which Guha was arrested. According to sources, the panel, a quasi-judicial body chaired by a senior faculty member with five other members, has the power to recommend dismissal of the accused. ìSince there is no redressal mechanism in place, our students could not come to us and lodge a complaint.

And these days, the spotted owlets in the Nicholson cemetery in Civil Lines, Delhi, which my bedroom overlooks, are chittering and squabbling querulously even at three in the morning. It is their breeding season and the stress of love and courtship and fighting rivals makes them (as it does us) tetchy. Actually, theyíre sweet dumpy looking birds, with icing sugar spots on their round brown heads, big golden eyes and an endearing way of bobbing their heads as they try and get a measure of you. Sometimes you can see them during the day. One monsoon morning, many years ago, a spotted owlet (pictured right) camped in a small tree right in front of my balcony for the entire day, unperturbed by the agitation it caused amongst other birds. It wasnít injured; it just stayed, meditating calmly on the tree till dusk and allowed me to go virtually right up to it, without flicking a feather. At dusk, it flew off. The other fairly common ìresidentî owl in Delhi is the mushroom coloured barn owl, with its heart-shaped face and a terrifying repertoire of shrieks and screeches. One never-to-be-forgotten winter morning in Qudsia gardens, near Kashmere Gate, I watched a pair smooch passionately as a frosty sun came up: with a face shaped thus what else could you expect? Three woolly babies, perched one on top of the other, grumpily waited for their parents to finish canoodling as the babblers and mynas began heckling. Owls are known to fly silently. Just how silently, I realised, at a Raptor Rehabilitation Centre in California years ago. Three or four barn owls were recuperating in a huge cage and would regularly fly up and down the length of this. Watching from three feet away, I couldnít hear the faintest whisper of a wing-beat. It was uncanny; like watching a silent film. With their acute hearing and eyesight, and this phantom flight, their prey ó rats and other rodents mainly ó have a hope in hell to escape. With their fierce, glowering expression, you would imagine owls would be very straitlaced and proper, puritanical even in their family life.

A longtime critic of a dominant Western view of the world, Pankaj Mishraís new book A Great Clamour, which began as a series of essays that he wrote for different publications, is based on his travels in China and its neighbourhood. In this interview, the 44-year-old writer and essayist, spoke about why he remains sceptical about the promise of capitalism, and the challenges of the travel writer in a new, too-familiar world. Excerpts: Given that you are a critic of liberal capitalism, did what you see in China challenge your beliefs? It would be incorrect to call me a critic of liberal capitalism, because I am also its product, and have benefited from it. I am a critic of those who think that it is the only legitimate worldview and ideology. Its great promise is that if you work hard enough, even if you are not part of any networks of power and privilege, you can reinvent yourself. My family was neither wealthy nor powerful. I didnít go to elite schools or colleges ó but I was able to became a writer. But I canít apply these lessons from my relatively privileged life to a vast majority of people, many of whom are excluded from the modern economy because they do not have the tools, nor the training, to enter it. Then there is the fact of people with different value systems and priorities. In Mashobra (a small town in Himachal Pradesh where Mishra lives when in India) over the years, I have seen people leaving their families, and then returning because they found life in the cities too alienating, because they wanted to be with their wives and newborns and ageing parents, even if that meant earning less. Much is made of the freedom that capitalism offers, but there are many people who also want the freedom to be idle, to not be driven to work too hard, who are not interested in a project of continuous self-advancement and aggrandisement. There cannot be one model of growth, one idea of what human beings are and what they want. In China, which once promised to be a classless utopia, there is now great economic inequality and disaffection. Hundreds of millions of people are still waiting ó and you have to remember China liberalised much earlier ó to experience even a modicum of prosperity. One has to be sensitive to the stories of the also-rans and the people who have been left behind, because much of the media focusses on a handful of success stories. But one gets a sense that you are not too interested in the Chinese economic miracle, which from the Indian experience of an inefficient state, seems remarkable. The Chinese invested early in public health and education. When they did not have the resources, they innovated, for example, spreading public health through ìbarefoot doctorsî.

893,"Related. Virender Sehwag turns his head to search for the sun in the cloudy winter sky as he steps out of his sparkling white Audi. He is in rural Haryana and is dressed casually. Had he been inside a cricket stadium, wearing India colours, Sehwagís cursory glance to the heavens, while walking in to bat, would trigger a chorus of ear-piercing whistles from the stands. To borrow a í80s Bollywood term, that look upwards would have been the first frame of his famous ìentryî. The roar would grow with every step the explosive opener would take towards the pitch. Not long ago, Sehwag striding towards the bowlers was similar to Amitabh Bachchan running straight at a gang in leathers holding chains and knives. It promised riveting action. It dragged you to the edge of your seat. You always wanted to get closer to the entertaining violence. And Sehwag, unlike that tall, angry superstar, went about his job with a smile. The last time Sehwag heard that din was nine months ago. India was playing Australia in a Test at Hyderabad. The 35-year-old had finished that game with six runs. That was the first week of March. Now itís the last week of 2013, a day after Christmas. Two 20-somethings are building Indiaís first innings against South Africa in the final Test of the series in Durban. They are part of a young Indian team that is soaking the heady, addictive din of the colosseum. Meanwhile, in a different time zone and setting, the former Test opener has taken guard for his second innings. This one isnít on a cricket field. Sehwag swaggers ó he never walks ó on to a freshly snipped patch of lawn that looks like a giant, green doormat on the porch of an imposing exposed-brick structure. That is the impressive facade of the Sehwag International School (SIS), which is spread over 23 acres, with numerous buildings that cover an area of 2 lakh square feet. The school is said to be close to Jhajjar district, but itís actually closer to Silani Pana Keso, a little-known village even in these parts. Call the atmosphere tranquil or eerily silent, but Sehwagís new workplace doesnít have the mad din of his day job. More so today, as the school is taking a winter break. The corridors, courtyards and classrooms are deserted. There are no children around to call him ìSirî but somehow, Sehwag, the face and founder of the school, still looks the part. That in many ways is puzzling. Who would have thought that the man with an ingrained contempt for text-book play and a rebellious approach to batting ósinging songs at the crease and hitting sixes while in the 90s isnít what obedient front-benchers at cricket academies do ó would transform into a man with plans to train young minds? The new look has helped Sehwag though. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses has eased his makeover from the bandana-wearing buccaneer, aka Sultan of Multan. Seated inside the conference hall, Sehwag takes off his glasses. He rubs his eyes, and also the imprints left behind by the spectacles on his nose, as he narrates the story of his school. It starts with Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda gifting him land in 2008 after his second triple ton in Tests. Disregarding advice from friends and family, Sehwag refused tie-ups, stayed away from partnerships, and didnít invite investment. Like always, he wanted to do it his way. Like always, he didnít like interference. He dug deep into his earnings, signed hefty cheques, managed big loans and built a ìKG to Class IXî co-ed school that within two years has 400 students, a cricket field, a football turf, an indoor swimming pool, tennis courts (clay, grass and synthetic), 400m athletics track, modern classrooms, labs, a stable for horses, auditoriums, an amphitheatre and air-conditioned hostels. He throws his head back and laughs when asked if his own school had any of these facilities. ìArora Vidya Mandir in Najafgarh was built on 200 square yards,î he says. I make a mental assessment. Arora Vidya Mandir could be easily accommodated in one of the corridors that spread out from the conference hall. From his wonder years, he narrates a yarn that tells you that the Sehwag household at Najafgarh, a Delhi suburb, wasnít one for the faint-hearted. In that extended Jat family, no one missed a chance to mock the other. When it came to banter, age was no bar. With young Viru preferring sports over studies, most of the wisecracks were directed at him. ìI was a cricketer while the other kids in the family would get 80 to 90 per cent marks. My academic record was keenly followed by everyone at home,î he says. The day Sehwag was to get his Class X board results, a crowd gathered at his home. ìAt least 50 of my family members were waiting for me. They wanted me to fail so that they could all laugh at me,î he says. After a pause, comes the punchline delivered with cinematic relish: ìSadly for them, I had passed. I threw the marksheet at them and said, ëAnybody who wishes (to cross-check) can take a look at thisí.î From an early age, Viru wasnít just the toughest of the Sehwags, he was also the most stubborn. ìFrom the time I got paid to play the under-19 World Cup in 1998, I havenít taken any money from home. They were feeding me all those years, isnít that enough?î he asks. Very early in his life, he told his father that he wasnít keen on being a farmer like him or managing the family shops at the anaaj mandi. Sehwag didnít want to take the beaten path, even when driving a car. ìEverybody in my family had a Maruti. So I got a Santro. They told me it was a wrong choice,î he says, a chuckle escaping him. How many times in your life have people told you that you are wrong, I ask. With a straight face, he replies, ìA thousand times.î Move your feet, play fewer shots, leave the ball, work harder, reinvest in your game, donít invest in the school. On second thoughts, a thousand is an extremely conservative estimate. Sehwag has defied convention and now preaches what he has practised all his life. At his school, he encourages children to break templates and write their own script. ìI ask them to pick characters from Ramayana, Mahabharata or Romeo and Juliet and write their own classics. You will be amazed with the kind of ideas they come up with,î he says. At home on weekends, six-year-old son Aryavir dresses up as Hanuman ó tail, mask, mace, the works ó as he rewrites mythology with his parents playing the divine lead couple. On the field, Sehwag might not have been the stereotypical ìthinking cricketerî, but he pushed those around him to think about their game. When leading a side, Sehwag was known to be a man of few words. During an IPL match, before the final, tense over, Delhi Daredevils pacer Umesh Yadav asked his skipper where he should bowl. ìBowler tu hai ya main?î shot back Sehwag. That day Yadav grew as a bowler. A few days ago, after a Ranji Trophy game, Punjabís coach asked Sehwag to give a pep talk to his boys. The highly obliged coach profusely praised Sehwag, going on about his impressive international record, touching each of his highs. Understandably, it took a while. Sehwag just needed one line to break the ice. ìMy message will be much smaller than this long introduction,î he said. He told the cricketers that how much hard work they wished to put in was up to them. Everything boiled down to enjoying the game, he said, as the Punjab Ranji players nodded collectively. ìNo coach or manager can force you to do things,î he said. The coach, at this point, panicked. ìWhat if they refuse to train?î ìMost serious cricketers start playing by the time they are six years old. When they reach first-class level, they have been playing the game for about 13 years. They can get bored. Even I get bored. I want to watch a movie. But when I come back, I enjoy the game better. Sometimes, time away from the game helps,î was Sehwagís reply. Of late, the school has been a healthy distraction for Sehwag. But there was a time when it started eating into much of his time. This was around 2011, the year the school started running. His wife Aarti had seen this coming. Even as Sehwagís dream was taking shape, she would wonder aloud, ìWho from the family would give time to the school?î Maybe, she knew the answer all along. Eventually, Aarti stepped in as the boss. ìShe is a postgraduate in mass communication,î says her proud husband. Aarti isnít far; she is in the room next door, in the middle of a staff meeting. The chairperson, she is mostly on the move, looking after the details. Even the monthly menu for the boarders, uploaded on the website, has her inputs. That includes lauki channa and bharwan karela. The mother of two growing children says, ìWe want to teach the children that they shouldnít have an aversion to anything.î Sehwag believes a focus on the details will eventually take care of the bigger picture. In the same breath, he also mentions a misjudgement. ìI should have built this school in stages. Since the entire construction started at one go, the loan amount went up. The fees take care of the operational costs but the interest on the loan needs to be taken care of.î Boarders at the school pay roughly Rs 3 lakh as annual fees, while for day scholars, the figure is Rs 60,000. Never a number cruncher, he says, ìI am not worried when we will break even. In the next 10 to 12 years, the business will take care of itself. My priority is to maintain a certain standard,î he says. Sehwag dreams of a day when parents, impressed by a well-groomed ìSehwagiteî in the neighbourhood, come searching for his school. Sehwag has seen something similar happen. He had made it happen. A decade ago, Najafgarhís budding cricketers went looking for the government school in Vikaspuri and its cricket coach, AN Sharma. They had heard of the boy Sharma had groomed into an international cricket star. The coach doesnít say much about ìSehwag, the teacherî, but canít stop talking about ìViru, the studentî, as the 70-year-old braves Delhiís late evening cold to oversee a net session and a match. In the late 1990s, Sehwagís father, after touching his feet, handed over three things to him ó a 1 kg box of mithai, Rs 11 and his son. ìHe told me, ëAaj se yeh ladka aapka huaí. Till date, no one has done this. When someone shows so much confidence in you, a bond grows. The child becomes your responsibility,î says the man, who likes a hearty laugh. ìI have told this story to many parents. They still donít get the mithai box.î Sharmaís biggest favour to Sehwag, and to Indian cricket, was that he didnít tamper with his studentís natural aggression. He worked on his technique in an unconventional way. When young Sehwagís backfoot dragged itself out of the crease, Sharma tied it to a pole. On another occasion at the nets, he tied a cloth bag filled with mud on the bulge of his wardís bat. The next day, Sehwagís bat flowed freely and fiercely. ìWhen he used to bat in the failing light, I would tell him, ëViru, ball nahi dikh rahi mujh koí. He would reply, ìSir, aap ball pheko mujhe dikh rahi haií,î Sharma says. Memories of the time he spent with the player who made him famous makes the old coach melancholic. ìThese days, children donít work hard. Itís frustrating.î He goes silent for a while. ìViru had asked me once. I think I should take up his offer and be at his school.î It is a strange turn of events. Years ago, a young Viru headed to Sharmaís school looking to pursue his passion. Who would have thought that one day Sharma would think about heading to his studentís school with the same purpose? But, before that, who would have thought Sehwag would run a school one day?",The unlikely makeover of Virender Sehwag | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/the-unlikely-makeover-of-virender-sehwag/

Lenovo is attempting to change that with a cylindrical metal grip on one side which lets users hold the tablet easily. Lenovoís Yoga moniker is no longer reserved for ultrabooks that can be bent backwards. The Chinese manufacturer, which recently said that it has moved from being a PC maker to a PC-plus company, has brought the Yoga brand name to two unconventional tablets. Lenovo Yoga Tablet comes in two screen sizes: the 8-inch variant costs Rs 22,999, and the 10-inch model is Rs 28,999. We reviewed the 8-inch Yoga Tablet. Build Quality and Design In a market full of look-alikes, the Lenovo Yoga Tablet stands out for its unique design. The tube grip on one edge of the tablet makes it easy to hold. Twisting the tube reveals a tiny stand, which by far is the most innovative addition to a tablet. If you have ever used an iPad with Appleís smart cover, you would know how much the typing experience improves after you fold the cover into a triangle . The stand on the Yoga Tablet lets you do the same thing without paying about Rs 4,000 more. But at 401 grams, the tablet is too heavy for single-hand use. Users can also use the stand to prop up the tablet. This, along with the front-facing speakers and Dolby sound, make watching films enjoyable on the Yoga Tablet. The only gripe is that the speakers are not loud enough for noisy places, but suffice for watching films at home. Holding a tablet in your hand while watching films is cumbersome for various reasons such as aching or sweating hands, and the deviceís rising temperature, especially during the summer. The tabletís stand eliminates that irksome experience altogether. Lenovo is known for making sturdy devices, as is evident from the companyís rugged ThinkPad laptops. The Yoga Tablet is no exception. The back panel of the tablet is made of metal, and so is the tube grip. This gives it a sturdy feel. The placement of the power button is unconventional ó at one end of the tube grip ó but itís easy to find once users get accustomed to the device. Display and Performance Yoga Tablet 8ís pricing pits it squarely against last yearís iPad Mini, and the display is just a shade inferior when compared to Appleís device.

In keeping with previous years, my wish list for 2014 is not too ambitious, because that would be setting oneself up for disappointment. Iím just hoping for thoda sa hatke, as the Bolly line goes. Give me one, I implore you, dear denizens of the biggest film industry in the world, just one film that will not have a man (it is almost always a man, so you canít accuse me of sexism) urinating, or farting, or sitting on the pot, or all of the above, in the name of humour. Comedies donít have to be constructed around wet patches or puddles or noxious smells; they can also be woven around circumstance, or character or, what do you know, even plot. I understand that these require writing skills and basic sharpness, but surely, in 800 films, is it so hard to come up with one that will not use base toilet humour as its only crutch? Yes, there are enough of us who can handle funnies that may only have smart lines or knotty situations. Watching someone take a dump can conceivably cause laughter, but is that all thatís left?

Just make sure they are meant for adults, not a string of juvenile, puerile jokes masquerading as ìcomediesî. It says a great deal for Bollywood as a 100-year-old film-making entity, and us as a ìgrowingî audience that we accept such gormless pap as Grand Masti as an ìadult sex comedyî: those leading men in the film just happen to be married, but are they grown up? Groan. Thrillers require pace and robust storytelling and heroes who can kick serious butt. What we get instead is limp set-pieces that Hollywood has long since done and dusted, fronted by ìsuperstarsî who look older than they should. Iím not saying we need fellows with soft down on their cheeks for action. Even Hollywood uses middle-aged heroes, especially to keep expensive franchises going, but they appear to be one with the plan.

Ahmedabadís real estate market is on an upswing because of to the huge growth of its industrial sector and the overall high rate of development, both in commercial and residential terms. It is the largest city of Gujarat, and also its commercial capital. It is the hub of the textile, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Apart from being a well-established education centre (with national institutes like IIM, NID and CEPT) Ahmedabad has also established itself as a major IT/ITeS and retail destination. The combination of the favourable factors naturally makes it a highly desirable residential destination. Ahmedabadís real estate market has grown tremendously over the past decade thanks to ultra-progressive policies and intelligent development governance. The city is providing extraordinary and unprecedented returns on the real estate front, and is one of the most exciting investment destinations in India today. Developers and investors from all over the country are beating a straight path to Ahmedabad. Office space investments have shown amazing growth, with capital values for commercial properties rising by as much as 20-30 per cent in areas such as Prahladnagar, Sarkhej-Gandhinagar. Highway, Ashram Road and some parts of East Ahmedabad. Residential property appreciation in the city has been to the tune of 50 per cent over the last three years. The areas currently commanding the highest demand for residential space are South Bopal, Bodakdev, Vastrapur, Nicol, Nava Naroda and New Ranip. Flats, apartments, serviced apartments, bungalows, penthouses and township properties are cropping up all over to meet the demand. In the past, residential development in was predominantly in the individual bungalow segment, and even today new bungalow schemes can be found on the outskirts of Ahmedabad city, especially along the Sardar Patel Ring Road. However, the scarcity of land and expensive real estate prices in the city have brought in the trend of apartment houses in form of high-rise towers in the city. The prime residential areas in the city are Shahibaug (in the northern part of the city), Satellite, Bodakdev, Vastrapur, Prahladnagar, Thaltej (in the western parts of the city), Maninagar and areas around Kankaria and Chandola Lake in the southern eastern parts of the city. The growth corridors for real estate development are the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Road, Sardar Patel Ring Road, Maninagar and on the north side of the Inner 132 ft Ring Road in areas like Nirnaynagar and Ranip. S-G Road and Sardar Patel Ring Road in particular have witnessed a lot of residential bungalow and farm house developments in the recent years.

As Singh has defaulted Rs 24.78 lakh home loan with a major private bank, the bank has seized the property in Ludhiana district of Punjab under the SARFAESI Act and put it up for auction. Hundreds of such new defaults and auctions have started haunting borrowers and lenders alike, indicating that the housing loan segment is not immune to the general slowdown across the country and the situation could take a turn for a worse. In fact, the situation has deteriorated in the real estate segment with loans amounting to an estimated Rs 7,700 crore tied to commercial and residential properties loans are up for sale, according to data compiled by NPAsource.com, a portal that focuses on stressed assets. Of this, there are as many as 2,200 units in the commercial category and around 11,000 units in the residential segment funded by banks and other financial institutions that have turned into non-performing assets (NPAs), which is why there are now on the block. This comes at time when the gross NPAs in the financial system is set to rise 4.6 per cent to Rs 2.29 lakh crore by September 2014 from Rs 1.67 lakh crore or 4.2 per cent in September 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its Financial Stability Report released last week. According to the RBI, the total exposure of the banking sector to the real estate segment was Rs 9.33 lakh crore, a rise of 17.3 per cent in 2012-13. During that period, growth in credit to sensitive sectors almost doubled primarily on account of credit to real estate. This expansion needs to be seen in light of the steep rise in housing prices in all tier I cities and several tier II cities over that year. The extent of outstanding loans in the housing segment surged by 15.4 per cent to Rs 4.75 lakh crore. Concerned over the rising loans in the realty, the RBI has already done thematic reviews of the banksí exposure to the real estate sector. Real estate experts blame investors ó speculators who book flats in the initial stages and sell them later when building gets completed for a profit ó for the surge in NPAs. The general belief is that genuine end-users rarely default on their loan repayment commitments. If figures released by the banks are any indication, luxury home buyers are not the major culprits as the average default is around Rs 55 lakh. However, industry sources said that defaults in the luxury segment in Mumbai and Delhi have started rising. ìGoing by the numbers and on doing a back-of-envelope calculation, the average value per unit ó either residential or office ó would be less than 55 lakh.

The decision to take up more real estate office space was mostly put on hold; or companies aggressively looked to bring down their costs. Corporates put their investment decisions on hold,waiting to see how the economic scenario unfolds especially in light of the forth-coming national elections. With this backdrop of uncertainty,commercial real estate in Mumbai produced mixed results. Office take-up in Mumbai in 2013 was recorded at 4.76 million sq. ft.,which was 21 per cent lower as compared to the previous year. The first half of 2013 was notably stronger than the second half,but the whole year was marked by a lack of large leasing transactions. The banking and financial services and IT/ITeS sectors was the prime driver of the office space market. Most occupiers that leased space in 2013 had done so either because the current lease agreement expired or to tap the opportunity to relocate and consolidate at lower rents in superior office space. Major micro-markets like Central Mumbai,Navi Mumbai,Andheri East & Western Suburbs together constitute approximately 70 per cent of the total absorption. As a result of dampened office demand,developers refrained from building new office space and speculative development remains limited and restricted to small dimensions. This is reflected in the reduction of new office supply which is reduced by 30 per cent as compared to last year. Approximately 3.5 million sq ft of Grade A Office building was delivered in 2013. This reduction in supply was due to delay in project completion. From the total delivered office space approximately 70% of the supply was concentrated in Andheri <U+0096> Kurla and Malad <U+0097> Goregaon stretch. Due to limited addition of supply,the vacancy has decreased marginally. Overall Grade A stock available for fit out is currently stood at 7.8 million sq. ft.,which is about 16 per cent lower as compared to last year figures of around 9.3 million sq. ft. This positive move further led to decline in average annual vacancy levels from 17 per cent in 2012 to 14 per cent in 2012 to 2013 respectively. Rentals remain stable in most of the market in Mumbai except marginal alterations in few of the micro markets such as CBD and Lower Parel registered an 3 per cent drop year-on-year,similar drop of around 1 per cent year-on-year has been recorded in Andheri East and Kalina micro-markets while western and central Mumbai,witnessed marginally increase of 1-2 per cent year-on-year. This year most of the companies were rather focusing on relocations or consolidation with lower rentals mindset. In 2013,there will be limited new supply add to the stock in 2014. Including deferred projects,the new supply expected in 2014 will be approximately 4 million sq ft. Most of this supply will be located in suburban and peripheral micro-markets such as,Andheri,Goregaon,Malad and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). A limited development pipeline should help to constrain any growth in vacancy rates; however,rental values will remain stable in nearly all micro-markets barring those where vacancy rates are already much higher than the cityís average,like Navi Mumbai and Thane. Andheri,BKC and Lower Parel will continue to interest occupiers; however the CBD will continue to lose share due to lack of availability of large floor plates,infrastructure,and distance from residential pockets in the city. As in 2013,landlords will be willing to offer greater incentives in 2014,rather than lowering base rentals.

He also cautioned the political parties that this failure should not be confused by the message of setting higher standards of probity and accountability. ""India was promised alternative politics. I had personally hoped that alternative politics promised by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would lead to larger footprints on the Indian society. Conventional political parties and politicians would realize the importance of probity and accountability. Instead, the country is being presented with gimmickry and the road to anarchy,"" Jaitley said in an article. ""My fear is that the failure of this experiment should not be confused by other parties as a failure of the good message of higher standards of probity and accountability,"" he added. Taking on the senior AAP leaders, Jaitley said there is an in-built danger in establishing a political party and then going out to search its members and its ideology and said a group of ""disparate, self-opinionated persons"" have flocked to the new outfit. ""The new party has a distinct concept of new jurisprudence, that judges now will have to report to the executive...The initial enthusiasm of mobocracy as an instrument of decision-making has somewhat died down,"" he said. The BJP leader also described various members of AAP from one being a former airline owner to a banker from Mumbai who appear to be protagonists of the market economy.","Country presented with ""gimmickry"": Arun Jaitley hits out at AAP - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/country-presented-with-gimmickry-arun-jaitley-hits-out-at-aap/articleshow/28897972.cms
900,"Related. The year 2013 was a year of survival for the real estate sector,but expectations are now high among developers and analysts. The industry is pinning hopes on a mid-year turnaround after the General Elections,it is not likely to materialise given the time lag for policy implementation. So how would 2014 pan out for realty? The first three quarters would see much of the problems of last year persisting,before showing some signs of change. Few experts believe that prices in several locations will go northward. That would be constraints since the problems of the sector remain unsolved,and policies have made no substantial impact,and those on the cards may not be enough to give the required momentum. Persistent problems. It was a year of <U+0093>slow-down,stagnancy and stalling<U+0094> for real estate,says Sachin Sandhir,MD,South Asia,Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS),a body certifying professionals and setting standards for the sector. <U+0093>It was a year of much economic turbulence. The current account deficit has fallen to 1.2 per cent of GDP in July-September period,while inflation is again above 10 per cent,as recorded in October. Wholesale price inflation was at an eight-month high of 7 per cent while retail inflation crossed 10 per cent. The rupee dropped sharply by net 22 per cent during first two quarters. Private equity (PE) investments witnessed a drop of over 65 per cent for the quarter-ended September 2013. All of this has negatively impacted investment sentiment.<U+0094> Even as the rupee fell,NRIs cashing in on the foreign exchange situation did not show up in sales numbers. The Reserve Bank of India<U+0092>s actions too,did not help. <U+0093>Monetary tightening resulting from RBI<U+0092>s measures to control inflation was the major macro influence on the real estate business in India,<U+0094> says Shishir Baijal,CMD,Knight Frank India,a real estate consultancy firm. <U+0093>High interest rates,spiralling vacancy levels and lower margins arising from inflationary pressures too,led to a slowdown which resulted in reduction of new launches and also delayed project deliveries. Developers with exposure to residential projects are worried as slow sales have created a situation of oversupply in many parts of the country,<U+0094> adds Baijal. Election time. The industry is anticipating relief in in Budget 2014-15,post elections. <U+0093>As far budget is concerned,there could be some appeasement for votes and some concessions to developers for funds by the outgoing government,<U+0094> says a property consultant on the condition of anonymity. <U+0093>However there is a risk of those decisions getting reversed when the new government takes charge. Irrespective of who comes to power,the second half year will be consumed in reviewing,modifying and approving various reforms and policies. Its impact will be experienced in 2015.<U+0094> Reform impact. <U+0093>The partial paralysis on the policy front has been one of the primary reasons for the slowdown,<U+0094> says Anuj Puri,chairman and Country Head Jones Lang LaSalle India,a real estate consultancy. <U+0093>Notoriously non-transparent,the sector certainly needed a fresh infusion of progressive reforms. The Real Estate Regulatory (RER) Bill and The Land Acquisition,Resettlement and Rehabilitation (LARR) Act are the major ones,<U+0094> adds Puri. <U+0093>However,both have clauses which threaten to further escalate prices in a market craving for absorption numbers. While RER Bill raised developer<U+0092>s funding concerns,the Land Acquisition Act has rendered the process costlier and more time-consuming.<U+0094> According to Anshuman Magazine,CMD,CBRE South Asia,<U+0093>In principle,the LARR Act is meant to promote transparency in land titling while protecting land holders but owing to rising cost and associated risks in it,more developers are likely to opt for joint venture development.<U+0094> Introduction of REITs in India failed earlier mainly due to economic slow-down. Capital markets regulator Sebi has released draft guidelines. However,if slow-down continues,REITs would run into trouble again. Further,if taxation issues are not resolved,the initiative may flounder yet again. Property prices. It was a vicious circle. High prices led to low sales and developers had piles of unsold inventory and lack of liquidity. This led to over-supply in many markets. In order to offload inventory,developers began offering discounts and freebies. But even that was beyond affordable limits of buyers. Deliveries were delayed,while low demand led to cancellation of new launches. Demand for ready-to-move in spaces and resale flats shot up as buyers were reluctant to risk their money in under-construction projects The same situation of 2013 is likely to continue in most of the period of 2014. According to a report by Colliers International,a real estate services firm,<U+0093>The end users will continue to be cautious. Current oversupply will get mitigated in coming quarters as very limited new projects are being launched. Capital values across most micro markets in almost all the major cities will remain stable even though the transaction volume will remain a constraint.<U+0094> <U+0093>Overall,residential markets are expected to witness stable capital values except for those projects which are over-leveraged and are unable to attract sales,<U+0094> says Sanjay Dutt,Executive MD,South Asia,Cushman and Wakefield,a real estate consultancy. <U+0093>Due to on-going infrastructure developments such as metro rail,mono rail and roads in Mumbai,NCR,Chennai,Bangalore etc,select locations here may witness healthy business activity,<U+0094> adds Durtt. According to Puri,redevelopment would be a growth driver in many metros and newer verticals such as rental housing,affordable housing and senior living would show increased activity. Developersí take. Developers expect the government to take a supportive approach towards the sector. <U+0093>The government should plan to reduce the housing shortage and encourage rental housing besides enacting the proposed bills,<U+0094> says Sunil Mantri,president,National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco). <U+0093>We expect the government to implement single-window and on-line approval system besides support in dealing with acute skill shortage,<U+0094> adds Mantri. <U+0093>The year 2013 has been the worst in terms of growth,sales and governance (approval process). However,the first three weeks in December have shown better sales than the previous month. This is an indication of the realisation that costs have gone very high thereby there is a very little possibility to reduce sale price,<U+0094> says Lalit Kumar Jain,chairman,Confederation of Real Estate Developers<U+0092> Associations of India (CREDAI). <U+0093>This with the pent up demand will result in better performance in the coming year. Political uncertainty is already discounted by the market but if there is a stable government post elections,then there is all the possibility of market getting into a very vibrant and upbeat mood,<U+0094> adds Jain. End users. Currently,investors and end-users are fence-sitters. Analysts are of the view that post elections,end-users with adequate funds will begin picking up the right sized and rightly priced properties. This absorption will lead to demand surpassing supply and in turn prices would see a rise in several selected locations. The positive impact of the new policies and reforms will translate in to better and bigger fund-flow in second half of the year,keeping prices buoyant. The expansion of manufacturing and services in Tier-II and Tier-III cities will result in greater demand. <U+0093>Residential capital value will increase in a subdued range of 10 to 12 per cent year-on-year,pan-India for the whole of the year 2014,<U+0094> says Puri. <U+0093>The market has turned from sellers to buyers with attractive offers across a range of projects. We expect the market to start upward momentum by the end of 2014 and suggest end-users and investors to utilise this opportunity to book their homes as these offers would vanish once economy starts showing signs of recovery<U+0094> says Brotin Banerjee,CEO and MD,Tata Housing. However,all analysts are unanimous that the buyer carrying out due diligence before signing up,and not be taken in by sentiments. Do a check on delivery record and the developer<U+0092>s reputation. Also bargain hard and bargain well. Desperate developers may be ready to offer discounts anywhere between 10-25 per cent. The mantra of right size,right price,location and infrastructure applies. The affordable and mid-size housing is likely to see better returns. Until new supply enters,rental and resale segments look strong. Overall,for the investor,the pre-election market will remain sluggish,but post elections,2014 will be no bull run.","Real estate sector: Growth starting,but no bull-run yet | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/real-estate-sector-growth-starting-but-no-bullrun-yet/
901,"Related. On December 30,the New Delhi Municipal Council will inaugurate a redeveloped Connaught Place,the centre point of the national capital. The project,much marred by delays has been the most difficult exercise for Engineers India Limited (EIL),the company tasked with the redevelopment exercise. Deepak Moudgil,Director- Projects at EIL under whose charge the project was implemented,spoke to Sandeep Singh on the challenges involved. Redevelopment of Connaught Place has been in focus over the last five years. What is your feeling now that it is complete? It has been a very painful process,however we are very happy about the work that we have done. Here the problem was that we were not capable of hsandeandling the pressure from people (traders etc) and we never anticipated such an environment. People had different perceptions,approvals were given by everyone but when we approached the site to work on the project,our people were turned away. NDMC too had its problems as people were going to courts etc. How did you enter this project and what changes were made later on? Initially,NDMC came to us with a renovation plan estimated at Rs 70 crore. We thought that if work was to be done in Connaught Place after 70 years,it should be such that no major work (digging etc) is required for the next 30 years at least. We proposed a redevelopment project costing around Rs 700 crore where we had proposed a tunnel in the middle circle which was the heart of the project and the idea was to keep all services in that. It was accepted. We had planned underground parking and several subways for achieving pedestrianisation but most of that was later shelved because of voices coming up against it. What led to the delay? The project moved from single phase (initial plan) to 8-9 phases and there were lot of permissions and approvals required which took their own time. There were lot of interlinkages <U+0097> cables,pipes etc and you can<U+0092>t cut them and they took their own time. We had proposed subways. While they all were approved,we were not given space to work and so what could have been completed in one month took over nine months. There were 29 toilets to be built (nine in the middle circle) but the moment we went for work on a toilet,shop owners would come and stop work stating that you can<U+0092>t make it behind or in front of my shop. People went to court. The last nine toilets became a hassle for us. People stopped us when we went for window replacements. All this took its toll. The approval from the Delhi Urban Arts Commission took its time and JNNURM funding had some procedural problems. Did you ever anticipate such resistance from people? We never imagined that we would work in such an environment. It was not created for us but the situation was such. We did not know who was the boss and whom we should talk to. Comparisons are drawn with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation,that they did things smoothly and in time? I think that DMRC did not have to face any of the problems we faced. There were 3,000 shop owners sitting there and they would always come to us with their reservations on the construction activities and in some cases they went to courts affecting the continuous working. DMRC got clear barricaded stretch to do their work. Even if residents were involved,they would get the houses demolished and everything was clear for them. We were in a different situation. It is said that the deadline for the project was October 2010,in time for the Commonwealth GamesÖ No. It was not a CWG project. It was decided that a part of the work including structure of tunnel work and restoration of buildings was to be done by July 2010 which we completed by July 23,2010. The remaining work was to be completed after the CWG and the deadline given was December 2012. Do you think the authorities backed out even after they had given approvals? I would not say that they backed out but the fact is that the social pressure was so much on everyone that people decided that way. It was a living project,the sensitivity of which nobody owned and we never went to the media. We tried to sensitise and intimated people there that this work will be done and if there is any problem please call on a particular number. I won<U+0092>t blame them completely,as people lost their patience. What other challenges did you face? All structures at Connaught Place are 70 years old and they are not reinforced concrete-framed structures. There is no structural stability and yet we dug 13 metres deep with without any damage to any building. Did the project witness any cost escalation? While the initial stipulated cost for the entire project was Rs 700 crore,two projects were shelved <U+0097> three layered parking (to park 5,500 park vehicles) and few subways. Once they were accounted for,the approved cost for the remaining project came at Rs 484 crore and we completed this in Rs 450 crore. Will you stay away from such projects in future? I would not say that. The fact is that,now we will try to stitch all approvals in place upfront and ensure there is a proper authority in place. In this case everyone came and had a role to play. Just six months ago,we were talked about so badly and that made us hesitant whether we should go for such public projects. Without authority and with moral responsibility of the project,it is tough.","<U+0091>Without authority,and with moral responsibility,it was a tough project<U+0092> | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/without-authority-and-with-moral-responsibility-it-was-a-tough-project/
902,"Related. Of the top eight cities,the National Capital Region (NCR) saw the least number of units being launced,which stood at 38,000 this calendar year. The decline,when compared on an all-India basis was 33 per cent year-on-year. The mid-segment,in the NCR registered the highest number of units launched at approximately 26,000,followed by the affordable segment which saw launches of approximately 25,000 units. Viewed on a segment-wise basis,both categories saw substantially reduced numbers with the affordable segment slipping by 29 per cent and the mid-segment by 37 per cent over the previous year. There were no launches in the luxury segment. Also all the launches were divided between Noida and Gurgaon with Delhi not witnessing any new housing unit launches this calendar year. Following the trend in 2012,more than 90 per cent of the new launches in 2013 were in the affordable and mid segment. While the first half of calendar 2013 saw launches primarily in the affordable and mid segment with marginal (2 per cent) contribution from the high-end segment,the second half on the other hand witnessed 18 per cent of the total launches in high-end segment. In the current economic scenario both buyers and developers are taking a cautious approach not only towards residential real estate but across all asset classes of real estate. However,given that most aspects of development such as construction cost,development cost,cost of land,time taken for approval and cost of debt all have been on an upward tangent developers have not been able to lower costs. Capital Values. Over the past year Delhi locations have registered a decline in capital values while Gurgaon and Noida witnessed appreciation due to relatively lower ticket size and new project launches which offered construction linked plans as opposed to ready properties in Delhi locations. The high-end segment in NCR markets of south west,south east and luxury category in Gurgaon all saw a decline in capital values to the tune of 5 7 per cent over the last year mostly on account of achieving already high values which in the current market scenario looked unsustainable. Due to pile of inventory and cautious buyer sentiments prevailing in the market amidst sluggish sales,the rental and capital values for high-end properties in Gurgaon saw a quarter-on-quarter decline by 3-12 per cent in calendar 2013 over the last quarter. The city saw reduction in investor activity with most enquiries generated by end users due to high gestation period of return and price points. Demand & Supply. The total estimated demand for housing in top eight cities of India is pegged at 2.9 million square feet of which NCR is expected to generate the highest demand of 7,70,000 units mostly for mid-range and high-end segments in the period of 2013-2017. In the same time frame,the expected cumulative supply is expected to be around 6,00,000 <U+0097> the demand- supply gap is expected to be approximately 22 per cent over the period. Some of this projected demand in the 2013-14 is expected to be met through the unsold inventory currently existing in the suburban and peripheral locations. The gap between fresh demand and supply is expected to see an incremental expansion as supply will fall short on account of economic,regulatory and political scenario. However,some of the demand in the next couple of years can be met through the existing vacant stock. In addition to the fresh supply,The New Delhi Master Plan 2020 is expected to unlock 66,000 hectares of land within New Delhi which is expected to largely cater to the residential sector. Thus new micro markets for residential development are expected to come up,it is yet to be seen in what proportion and configurations will these units will be created. While demand for housing units will grow proportionate to the rise in population,supply is expected to be less aggressive in the short to medium term. New regulations like the Land Acquisition Act and the real estate regulatory bill which are expected to come into force in the next few quarters will affect supply positively.","NCR market: Sluggish,but stable | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/ncr-market-sluggish-but-stable/

But in his reincarnated avatar,Sparky isnít a cuddly dog but an abomination that needs to be chased away by New Holland residents.

904,"Summary. Related. There have been many,many films featuring flirty little girls and madly obsessed middle-aged men. But nothing has come close to the original Lolita,directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is said Vladimir Nabokov,Lolita<U+0092>s author,wrote the script. But it is also said that very little of it was used. Kubrick was dismissive of the novel<U+0092>s flabby middle; Nabokov remained polite about the film. Another version of Lolita was filmed much later. This one was truer to the novel. But there<U+0092>s nothing to beat that imbued-with-nymphet-glow original film,which turns 50 this year. Its black-and-whiteness speaks of its age. So do a few of its overdone passages. But it remains a masterpiece,which could only have been done by Kubrick. James Mason plays Humbert,the professor of French poetry who comes looking for a house in New Hampshire. He is about to wiggle out of Shelley Winters<U+0092> too-eager widow<U+0092>s clutches,but changes his mind when he sets eyes upon her daughter,the 14-year-old Lolita. She is disporting herself in the garden,in a bikini and dark glasses,looking much older than her years. In one glance,she reads the man more clearly than her mother ever will. She,the young girl who was perhaps born a seductress,knows he will never be able to leave. Nabokov<U+0092>s classic novel stirred much outrage. How could anyone write such a novel about a 12-year-old girl? Keeping conservative audiences in mind,the film made Lolita a young teen,and the way Sue Lyon plays her <U+0097> precocious,aware,deeply sexual <U+0097> no one is kept in any doubt that this is not a child. It is a woman who knows her power. Any male looking at Lyon and not wanting to drag her off into a dark cave would have been either blind,or gay,a word not in currency when the film came out.

905,"Summary. Related. Producing variations on a successful theme is a preferred Hollywood tactic; why fix it if it earns millions of dollars or clumps of awards or both? Studios zealously track each other<U+0092>s development slates and so it is no surprise that,in any given year,it looks like directors and producers share a hive mind. Their Borg-like tendencies gave us Deep Impact and Armageddon in 1998 <U+0097> both movies threatened apocalypse via meteors <U+0097> and the lamentable Antz and A Bug<U+0092>s Life (not bad,but surely a lesser Pixar work),also in 1998. In 2006,we had magician movies The Illusionist and The Prestige. This year,audiences chose between two Snow Whites. In most of these cases there is a clear winner in terms of box office and quality. But sometimes,like in 2011,we are lucky enough to get two films of equal quality with delightfully different takes on their rather similar themes. Michel Hazanavicius<U+0092> The Artist is a charming depiction of the silent film era that captures the fall and rise of its biggest star,played by Jean Dujardin in an Oscar-winning turn. The titular artist struggles to come to terms with a new-fangled technology (that he is determined is just a fad) <U+0097> talking movies <U+0097> and Dujardin manages,without words,to portray a charismatic,if stubborn,man who nearly loses everything. The real standout,however,is Berenice Bejo,who plays Peppy Miller,a starlet who becomes a star even as Dujardin<U+0092>s George Valentin<U+0092>s star falls with his refusal do talking movies. Miller falls in love with Valentin and remains a source of support even when he doesn<U+0092>t want it. Indeed,she is the reason he doesn<U+0092>t end up like Georges MÈliËs in Martin Scorcese<U+0092>s steampunk love letter to cinema,Hugo. Scorcese<U+0092>s MÈliËs,based on the real-life movie pioneer,is a visionary and genius whose work,like Valentin<U+0092>s,is not so much unappreciated in its time as left behind by it. Bitter at how society and World War I treated him,MÈliËs retreats from the world,setting fire to his work and enveloping himself in a garb of disillusionment. He meets his Peppy much later in life,in the form of an orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield) who lives in a clock tower at a train station and forces MÈliËs to remember his past career. This leads to a wonderful digression where we get to see almost the entirety of MÈliËs 1902 silent classic A Trip to the Moon. In both films,denouements are made and happy endings are had. Both employ devices to evoke a different era,Hazanavicius by actually making his movie silent,and Scorcese by employing 3D to good effect. Hugo looks as wonderful in two dimensions,however,with the opening sequence retaining its splendour. But both DVDs are thin on <U+0093>extras<U+0094> (The Artist DVD forgoes them entirely),particularly disappointing as the era is ripe for some Hollywood romanticism. Hugo contains <U+0093>a making of<U+0094>,which is serviceable without offering a truly in-depth look at the working methods of one of the movie industry<U+0092>s greatest living directors.",Twilight Sagas | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/twilight-sagas/
906,"A grievance redress system must provide a decentralised system for receiving and dealing with complaints. India must build on the polio campaign to prioritise childhood immunisation. This week, we mark the three-year anniversary of the last case of polio virus in India. It is a monumental achievement ó and arguably one of the greatest public health success stories of all time. The legacy of the polio campaign is more than just the successful eradication of the crippling disease. The systems and strategies put in place to reach every child in every part of the country with lifesaving polio vaccines can be used to save millions of children from other preventable diseases. According to Unicef, every year in India, 1.4 million children under five die from preventable diseases. Reaching every child with timely vaccination could dramatically reduce child deaths in the country. Polio shows that this can be done, if we put our minds to it. Five years ago, India had nearly half of the worldís polio cases. Experts considered the country the most technically difficult place to end polio, with migration, high population density and low immunisation coverage posing significant challenges. Through the commitment and leadership of the government and with support from national and international partners, over 2.3 million vaccinators immunised 172 million children with the polio vaccine every year. A vast surveillance system was established to allow vaccinators to respond quickly to outbreaks. Strategies were formed to target children in vulnerable communities and other places that were hard to reach. While we have won the war on polio, we still have a long way to go in combating other childhood diseases that can be prevented with vaccines. Today, we have vaccines that protect against some of the most common childhood diseases. If we can get the polio vaccine to every child, why canít we do the same with vaccines that protect children against a whole range deadly of diseases? We need to instil the urgency displayed against polio into the fight against other childhood diseases. While we have made some progress, we are catastrophically off course to meet the UN Millennium Development Goal 4, which calls for reducing child mortality by two-thirds by next year. The national immunisation programme has only 61 per cent coverage across the country. We lag behind many of our neighbours in introducing critical new vaccines into the national immunisation programme, including those to protect against the leading causes of diarrhoea and pneumonia ó the two biggest killers of children under five. India has the opportunity to build on the success of the polio campaign to prioritise childhood immunisation. Polio successes have already contributed to efforts against other vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, the government has implemented a polio-style vaccination campaign in 14 high-risk states against measles, a disease that killed approximately 56,000 children in 2011. Surveillance laboratory systems set up under the polio programme now help monitor for measles outbreaks. Already, large declines in measles cases have been recorded in several states. This is a great step forward and more should be done to leverage the systems and strategies that have defeated polio. The opposition to efforts to strengthen and expand childhood immunisation, however, poses a real threat. There are some groups that vocally continue to resist vaccination, particularly newer vaccines. Most recently, criticism has stemmed from a small group of doctors that has expressed unfounded scepticism against the five-in-one pentavalent vaccine, despite the vast body of evidence supporting the use of this vaccine. Based on appropriate scientific evidence and recommendations, the government made the decision to introduce the pentavalent vaccine, which protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and haemophilus B (Hib), in the national immunisation system. This is an important step towards ensuring that children are protected from life-threatening illnesses, including pneumonia and meningitis caused by Hib. The Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), an umbrella body of 22,500 paediatricians, and many others supported this long-overdue decision. In fact, during my tenure as IAP president, we released a comprehensive statement condemning the criticism and denounced the attempts to distort facts and create confusion regarding the safety of the vaccine. As medical professionals, we have the responsibility to put children first and use science to inform our decisions. It is time we focused our efforts on ensuring that all children receive scientifically proven vaccines. The polio campaign has shown the power of vaccines to wipe out a disease and safeguard the future of our children. We can continue to build on the legacy of polio to strengthen routine immunisation. This includes adding new vaccines into the national immunisation system when recommended by the experts.

907,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries' surprise entry into auction for mobile phone spectrum has raised the prospect of fierce bidding, intensifying competition in a crowded cellular market that has seen margins improve after a lengthy price war. Reliance, controlled by Mukesh Ambani , sits on a cash pile of nearly $15 billion, which gives it an advantage at the spectrum auction over rivals like market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd, which had nearly $10 billion in debt as of end-September. Reliance also already owns a nationwide licence for high-speed 4G mobile phone networks, which it won by outbidding rivals three years ago. The service, by its Reliance Jio Infocomm unit, has yet to be launched. ""The immediate impact is that of intense competition in auctions,"" Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. ""The longer term impact could be increased competition and higher capex for incumbents,"" the brokerage said, downgrading shares in Bharti Airtel and third-ranked Idea Cellular . Shares in Bharti Airtel and Idea tumbled on Thursday, largely due to Reliance's application to bid. Bharti stock closed 4.8 percent lower, its biggest drop since September last year, while Idea Cellular tumbled 7.2 percent, losing the most since May 2010. Reliance on Wednesday joined seven carriers including Bharti, Vodafone and Idea to bid for spectrum in the auction. India hopes to raise at least $1.8 billion during the fiscal year to March from the auction which is scheduled to start on February 3. Reliance gets most of its revenue from oil and gas. The spectrum bands it applied to bid for would enable the company to provide basic cellphone services, which account for more than 80 percent of industry revenue in India, a country where call rates are among the cheapest in the world. Most telecom operators saw razor-thin margins improve slightly last year after they were able to raise call prices, helped by a court order that revoked permits of some smaller carriers, which were forced to scale back or shut down. Two bands of frequencies -- 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz - will be sold. Bharti and Vodafone want spectrum in the 900 MHz band to renew permits in key cities like Delhi and Mumbai but they could also use the spectrum for 3G services. Reliance Industries could use the 1,800 MHz band to offer cellphone services or a different kind of 4G network. With the 900 MHz spectrum, it could provide 2G as well as 3G mobile services. Reliance aims to buy spectrum in both bands as 900 MHz is not available beyond Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, said a person familiar with the company's plans who declined to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Reliance already has deals to share infrastructure with both Bharti and Reliance Communications , which is controlled by Mukesh Ambani's brother, Anil Ambani .",Fierce bidding seen for spectrum auction after Reliance Jio entry - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/fierce-bidding-seen-for-spectrum-auction-after-reliance-jio-entry/articleshow/28893686.cms
908,"GSM service provider Videocon Telecom has scrapped its plan to participate in the upcoming spectrum auction for airwaves in 1800 Mhz band. In December 2013, the company announced its plans to participate in the February spectrum auction and said that it would bid for additional 2 Mhz spectrum each for the Punjab and Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh Telecom circles in the 1800 Mhz band. The telcos' CEO and Director, Arvind Bali said that after a lot of contemplation, the company has decided not to participate in the current spectrum auctions. ""In Punjab circles, 25 out of 92 blocks are not available in Ludhiana and Amritsar, and these are places where we are facing a little congestion, so we'd rather deploy more sites than acquiring spectrum. So it doesn't make any sense for us to bid here,"" Bali explained. Next step: 4G rollout? ""Delhi is much evolved market, and in order to capitalise on the opportunity, our team, consulting partners and technology partners felt that 4G LTE rollout would be a catalyst for making a differentiation,"" Bali said. The executive said that worldwide the 4G LTE ecosystem is not that evolved in the 900 MHz space, which makes the cost of deployment very expensive, thus making 900 not suitable for 4G. ""We feel that the 4G ecosystem in 900 MHz band should evolve in the coming years and that should be the time we will look at options,"" he added.

909,"A grievance redress system must provide a decentralised system for receiving and dealing with complaints. The 2013 bill passed by Parliament is sloppy, complex and unreadable. The quality of parliamentary debate in India has always been lamented. When it comes to matters of lawmaking, the art of asking the right questions about substance is rare enough; the art of having a real debate about style and form is practically extinct. This is true of primary laws passed by Parliament or by state legislatures, and also of subordinate legislation issued by regulators. The outcome is that Indian laws are often poorly drafted, requiring frequent amendments and tedious judicial clarification. A case in point is the 2013 version of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill, as passed by both houses of Parliament. Considerable time was spent debating substantive issues, but the billís drafting style was ignored. Some innocuous (but classic) examples of poor drafting that the bill exhibits are gathered here. Matters of grammar, punctuation, political correctness (gender neutral, anyone?), and plain sloppiness aside, the bill is complex and unreadable for many reasons. There is the problem of ambiguity, where a provision invites more than one possible meaning. For example, one subsection empowers the lokpal to authorise agencies to search and seize documents, that, ìin its opinionî are useful for an investigation, if it ìhas reason to believeî that such documents are secreted in any place. Later, in another situation, the lokpal must record reasons for its belief in writing. While tests in jurisprudence may conclude that belief and opinion are to be treated the same, and that both have to be reduced to writing, this text of law prompts many questions: (a) Since ìbeliefî and ìopinionî are used in the same sentence, are they intended to mean different things? (b) Does the lokpal not have to record reasons for its belief in writing unless specifically asked? (c) Do opinions not have to be recorded in writing at all? And so on. Clarity and precision, two essential principles of the rule of law, cannot be co-opted by allusion. Phrases common in law but increasingly regarded as archaic, and open to ambiguity and misuse, are omnipresent, such as ìwithout prejudice toÖî and ìprovided thatÖî. A perennial legal favourite, ìnotwithstanding xyzî (implying that ìxyzî will be ignored and overridden), appears over a dozen times. (The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service that serves the legislative needs of the US Congress describes ìnotwithstandingî aptly as ìthe statutory equivalent of a parent telling a childÖ ëI really mean itíî, and therefore, regards it as superfluous.) Courts still have to decipher ìxyzî, and examine why it is not applicable in.",Our poorly written Lokpal | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/our-poorly-written-lokpal/

Bardhan believes the Left should learn how to forge links with the masses from the Aam Aadmi Party. In an article in the journal New Age, the former CPI general secretary discusses young peopleís renewed interest in politics. ìGone are the days of stagnation when young people were more concerned with their own individual future, when careerism dominated their thinking. They have come to realise that their own future is inextricably linked with the future and the destiny of the country. A big section looks forward to socialism, even if the outlines are not sufficiently clear to all of them,î he writes. He claims students have started flocking to the CPIís student and youth wings. ìWe have to dip into this reservoir of young militants who are already radical-minded, left-oriented, with a vision of socialism, and draw them into the party. They are already in the midst of struggles and movements on various issues,î he says. GOOD AUDIT. The CPM weekly, Peopleís Democracy, welcomes the Delhi High Court judgment bringing private telecom companies under the ambit of a CAG audit. It believes the order is seminal and argues that the power of the CAG to audit private firms using public resources should not be seen as interference in the functioning of a private firm or violating Article 149 of the Constitution. An editorial argues that private telecom companies pay between 1 to 8 per cent as spectrum usage charges apart from an annual license fee. ìBesides ensuring that the government receives its legitimate earnings from the private telecom companies, the audit will enable the government and the people to see that the telecom operators are not under-reporting revenues, part of which accrue to the public exchequer,î it asserts. The editorial also backs the Delhi governmentís move asking for an audit of the three private power distribution companies. ìSince 49 per cent of these companies is owned by the Delhi governmentÖ it is only appropriate that these accounts be audited by the CAG. Yet, there is a strong oppositionÖ This only amounts to suggesting that the existing overwhelming prevalence of ëcrony capitalismí that permits profit maximisation through means other than legitimate must remain unregulated and unchecked,î it states. PRESSURE FROM BELOW. After the collapse of the AAP governmentís janta durbar and the criticisms directed at the party because of its failure, the CPI(ML) claims there is pressure from rightwing and establishment forces on the Delhi government. ìIt is for the workers, women and common people of Delhi to exert pressure in the other direction and ensure that the government remains true to its promises,î an editorial in the weekly ML Update says. ìThe BJP and the Congress were quick to brand the whole exercise as ëanarchyí, and the AAPís former fellow travellers like Kiran Bedi (now.",View from the left | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/view-from-the-left-45/

The Pakistani Taliban has said it will target journalists and media organisations for ìfabricatingî the statement of its spokesperson asking news outlets not to pay tribute to cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar on his retirement. The shura council of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan,headed by its new chief Mullah Fazlullah,decided to attack the journalists and media organisations which had carried statement of their spokesman Shahidullah Shahid regarding Tendulkar and Pakistani cricket team captain Misbah-ul-Haq. ìIn Tuesdayís meeting,we decided to target only journalists and media organisations which twisted the recent statement of Shahidullah Shahid and tried to tarnish Talibanís image nationally and internationally,î an unnamed senior Taliban leader and member of the shura was quoted as saying by The News daily. ìThe task has been given to a select group of people within the Taliban to collect information about the journalists and media organisations who fabricated statement of the spokesman,î he said. An initial clipped video of the TTP spokesperson was circulated on social media networks which showed TTP spokesperson criticising the Pakistani media over its coverage of Tendulkar. However,a longer video with his full remarks showed that he was not criticising the media but saying that those opposed to referring to dead militants as martyrs are like persons who do not want Tendulkar to be praised because he is an Indian.

Americans James Rothman and Randy Schekman and German-born researcher Thomas Suedhof won the 2013 Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries on how hormones,enzymes and other key substances are transported within cells. The Nobel committee said their research on ìvesicle trafficî-the transport system of our cells-helped scientists understand how ìcargo is delivered to the right place at the right timeî inside cells. Disturbances to the system can contribute to diabetes and neurological and immunological disorders,the committee said. Rothman,62,is a professor at Yale University while Schekman,64,is at the University of California,Berkeley. Suedhof,57,joined Stanford University in 2008. ìMy first reaction was,îOh,my God!î said Schekman in a statement released by Berkeley. ìThat was also my second reaction.î The university said Schekmanís research led to the success of the biotechnology industry. Schekman studied normal and defective yeast to identify the process of vesicle transport,the university said. The Nobel committee said Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle transport,while Rothman revealed how proteins dock with their target membranes like two sides of a zipper. Sudhof found out how vesicles release their cargo with precision. ìThese discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell,î the committee said. Rothman and Schekman won the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for their research in 2002 <U+0097> an award often seen as a precursor of a Nobel Prize. The medicine prize kicked off this yearís Nobel announcements. The awards in physics,chemistry,literature,peace and economics will be announced by other prize juries this week and next.

In an interview, Kody Brown and his four wives said they felt humbled and cried when they heard in mid-December that the judge had ruled in their favour in a lawsuit they brought against Utah in July 2011 after they fled the state for Las Vegas under the threat of prosecution. ìThe first thing I thought about was all those families that for 100 years had lived and loved in obscurity, just in secrecy,î said Kody Brown in a telephone interview from Las Vegas. ìNot being able to claim their family or openly love one another.î Kody and his wives ó Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn ó said they hope the landmark ruling stands and enables other polygamous families in Utah to live openly without fearing prosecution. ìItís been incredible not having to live in fear anymore and being able to fully claim who we are,î said Christine Brown, Kodyís third wife. The Utah attorney generalís office has not yet decided if it will appeal the ruling, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman. The stateís new attorney general, Sean Reyes, has been in office for less than two weeks. Jonathan Turley, the Brownsí Washington, DC-based attorney, said heís been told Utah will appeal. He said that heís eager to defend the ruling before the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals. US District Judge Clark Waddoups said in the decision handed down on December 13 that a provision in Utahís bigamy law forbidding cohabitation with another person violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of religion. The ruling decriminalises polygamy, but bigamy ó holding marriage licenses with multiple partners ó is still illegal. Utahís law was considered stricter than the laws in 49 other states because of the cohabitation clause. If the ruling stands, Utahís law would be identical to most other states that prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. In most polygamous families in Utah, the man is legally married to one woman but only ìspiritually marriedî to the others. There are an estimated 38,000 fundamentalist Mormons who practice or believe in polygamy, most living in Utah and other Western states. Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of the Mormon church but has no place in modern Mormonism, church officials said in a statement. The Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned polygamy in 1890 as part of a successful campaign for US statehood and it strictly prohibits the practice for its 15 million members worldwide. Though some have correlated the Browns fight to decriminalise polygamy with efforts to legalise gay marriage, the Browns donít see the two as being the same.

His detractors, first and foremost the Palestinians, considered him a war criminal and held him responsible for years of bloodshed.

In films deemed classics,which you see much after they were made,you can read meaning into scenes which the filmmaker did not intend,but here director George Lucas meant every single scene to be exactly what it is,and the whole adds up to a brilliant combination of pop culture signifiers,young desires and dreams <U+0097> an ode to lost innocence,and an era gone for ever. When the choice is whether to leave town for college or stay back in Modesto,Calif. in 1962,and that is the hardest choice that the just-finished-with-high-school lads have to make,you know that that was a time. Lucas made American Graffiti as a tribute to his own youth spent on the West Coast of the US,in which cruisin<U+0092> was a big part of life.

924,"Silences of the†heart. Summary. Related. 27 Down. Cinemas Of India, Rs 199. One of the near-forgotten gems that NFDC<U+0092>s Cinemas Of India DVD series has rescued is a film called 27 Down. It came out in 1974,just a year after Amitabh Bachchan had begun his climb up the superstar ladder with Zanjeer,and Shyam Benegal had unleashed his brilliant Ankur upon us. Bachchan is still amongst us. So is Benegal. But the young director who made the remarkable 27 Down couldn<U+0092>t do anything after his debut because he died in an accident soon after. Awtar Krishna Kaul was too young to die,but he had just about enough time to create a film which looked at a young couple as they came at each other and made tentative stabs at finding oneself in the other in a way most young people today would find familiar. Delhi theatre veteran MK Raina plays Sanjay,son of a railway employee who wants to do anything other than join his father<U+0092>s profession. Circumstances will otherwise,and Sanjay<U+0092>s days are spent ticket-checking,and nights sacked out on rail berths. His meeting with Shalini (Rakhee Gulzar) takes him out of the ennui he is sunk into,and you travel along with them,as they go up and down trains,pausing to make conversation and have tea,waiting for them to get somewhere. Filmmakers will tell you what a nightmare it is to shoot on railway platforms. The chaos is never ending,and there is no control over crowds. Which is why most movies are shot during nights,or in abandoned sidings which are converted into bustling arrivals and departures through extras. 27 Down was shot on actual locations,so you can get a sense of the tumult outside. As well as within. There are no grand gestures in the film,no speeches. Just a quietness that settles in on the lives of the characters as they travel to and fro,marking yet another day. A recent conversation with Raina,whose jet black beard (in the film) is now speckled with grey, yielded interesting factoids. Chief amongst which was the wiles he had to use to get Rakhee,the biggest star of the film (the rest,Sudhir Dalvi,Sadhu Meher,were practically unknown at the time) to dub for the film. He also spoke about how much of the shoot was done in stealth to keep everything natural,and how a lot of it was done on a wing and a prayer because there was so little money. Par hamne kaha dekhi jayegi,ek din aur shoot kar kete hain,(but we said,we<U+0092>ll see,let<U+0092>s just get this day over and done with) said Raina,whose character oscillates between filial duty and romantic love,trying to find a way out. 27 Down is compelling because it is quiet. It doesn<U+0092>t shout.

925,"Summary. Related. I<U+0092>ve been curious about this film ever since I saw the patrician Christopher Plummer delivering a peach of a speech after accepting the Best Supporting Actor trophy at the Oscars this year. For some reason,Beginners,about a seventy-plus plus gay man,did not release in India. Or was it for good reason? We are,despite our Dostana(s),and endless <U+0093>Kanta Ben<U+0094>-type gags in Bollywood,†still not quite prepared for something like the Beginners,which pares everything down to this one thing: that a man who would pretty much be considered at the end of his prime,steps out from the closet,and decides to do something about it. He changes his wardrobe,goes cruising,and finds true love. Watching Plummer making a meal of this mouthful of a part,was a pleasure. This is one of those roles that is not merely good. It is a great role,and a superlative performance. The death of a long-time spouse can be devastating. Hal (Plummer) deals both with loss and liberation. A life,and a wife,that he liked is now gone,leaving him not your garden variety widower. He puts out ads in the personal sections of the local paper,about being <U+0093>mature<U+0094> and <U+0093>horny<U+0094>,and speedily acquires a much younger lover. The film begins backwards,with Hal<U+0092>s death,with his son Oliver (Ewan McGregor) trying to cope with not just a parental death,but a life that he lived looking at his parents living the life they did. To his young eyes,it seemed that his mother and father were forever in an arid relationship,pecking each other on the cheek without discernible passion. We see mother and son spending lots of time,the mother dealing with her Jewishness (this was the time of the Nazis,and Hitler and World War II),and her husband<U+0092>s latent homosexuality,and finding refuge in abstruse art exhibitions,and ironic chats with her son. Parts of this film feel too fey. Especially because the pretty girl who catches the morose Oliver<U+0092>s eye,just happens to be French. Anna (Melanie Laurent,who was in Inglorious Bastards) sports tousled hair,and an air of winsomeness and hurt wisdom. She<U+0092>s the kind of girl who can take one look at a man and declare that he<U+0092>s <U+0093>sad<U+0094>. But there<U+0092>s enough in the film which saves it from drowning in preciousness: even the dog who communicates with his human owners through speech bubbles seems reasonably cute more often than not. The reason for the staying with the film is simple. Hal<U+0092>s act of finding fulfillment at the fag end,ha ha,of his life,is one of courage and forthrightness,which comes from the honest writing. The film is based on director Mike Mills<U+0092>s own father<U+0092>s story,who came out at 75: the real-life-ness comes from real life. <U+0093>I looked at the husbands,not the wives,when I went to parties<U+0094>,Hal tells his son. Hal agrees to a life of tamping down upon his real self (he knew about his <U+0093>tendencies<U+0094> when he was twelve: at that time homosexuality was considered a disease) when the girl who proposes to him says she understands who he really is,and doesn<U+0092>t really mind. But it<U+0092>s never that simple,is it? The sheer delight,erotic desire mixed with pure fun,that is visible in Hal<U+0092>s being (a critic called it,rightly,<U+0093>radiating gayness<U+0094>) is really what lifts this film. And gives the fumbling Oliver (McGregor<U+0092>s good too) hope that he can actually find someone who will love him for who he is.

A powerful indictment of racial segregation in the suburban America of the early <U+0092>60s,it also affirms the strength of the women who come together to tell their stories. Yet a second watch makes you wonder if The Help is not as misogynist as it is feminist. Bryce Dallas Howard as the racist Hilly Holbrook is simply evil.

Even Hilly<U+0092>s mother,who is sympathetic to the black women working in their house,is little more than a dotty,cackling old lady. In contrast,Emma Stone as Skeeter,a young writer,is laughed at by the other women but emerges triumphant in the end (this is not a spoiler,how else was it supposed to turn out?). The film might have more than its fair share of the Cinderella complex. Only in this case,Cinderella gets a job and goes to New York while her suitor walks off in a huff. Davis and Spencer deliver powerhouse performances,revisiting the Mammy figure and portraying it refreshingly free of cliche <U+0097> although the scriptwriter has been criticised for making Davis speak in a dialect that is far too <U+0093>old-timey<U+0094>. Racial discrimination can perhaps be depicted without trying to wring the last tear out of audiences. The DVD version of The Help includes a video of The living proof,sung by Mary J Blige,composed especially for the film and contributing generously to its high-octane sentimentality. It also includes two scenes that were cut from the film. One is a droll scene where Skeeter<U+0092>s boyfriend goes to meet her mother and reveals that his father is a Republican senator.

Subtitled Hastily gobled up in Five Moneth<U+0092>s Travels<U+0094>,it described a jaunt through Europe and was a smash hit with the paying public in 1611. A lot of travel writing in the start was just landscape porn,drawing up elaborate word pictures.

In a world where even Antarctica gets around 40,000 tourists every year,the first option is increasingly harder to do. For the second option,the wackier the gimmick,the more the masala.

Srinath Perur<U+0092>s If It<U+0092>s Monday,It Must Be Madurai is not about remote places and locales. Perur beats a path down beaten-to-death paths like Dharavi,Jaisalmer and Interlaken. What is his angle? Perur picks conducted tours,what he calls a <U+0093>travel experience with a fixed itinerary,orchestrated by someone else,and undertaken in a group<U+0094>. It sounded like a snoozefest. What on earth could he do with the material,I wondered? Certainly,no serious travel writer would contemplate not going alone. Critic Brian Phillips goes as far to say,<U+0093>the spy movie is a fantasy about tourism<U+0094>. This is the essential glamour of making your way through a foreign land. A glamour utterly negated by travelling indiscriminately in a herd. Group tours imply no control,an enforced passivity,to dance like bears to the cracked tune of the tour guide.

We see nothing in Europe. We come here with pictures in our heads,and we leave with our heads in those pictures<U+0094>. A common trap for travel writers is that you are constantly hoovering up information and incidents for possible use.

928,"Chinese†Whispers. Summary. Related. The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution 1945-57. Author:Frank Dikˆtter. Publisher: Bloomsbury. Pages: 378. Price: Rs 699. The most interesting fact about Frank Dikˆtter<U+0092>s latest book is that it is available in bookstores in China,where it has been described as a <U+0093>fabrication<U+0094>. Dikˆtter has acknowledged this as a <U+0093>compliment<U+0094>. That gives us a sense of the politics that constitutes the backdrop against which the Maoist period is being assessed,globally and within China. But more on that later. It is necessary to first understand the challenge one faces in reviewing this book <U+0097> if one agrees with Dikˆtter,the review is superfluous,and if one disagrees,one is mischievous (or an <U+0093>apologist<U+0094>). This prequel to his Mao<U+0092>s Great Famine: The History of China<U+0092>s Most Devastating Catastrophe 1958-1962,which won the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2011,aims to convincingly establish that the Chinese revolution/liberation was <U+0093>first and foremost a history of calculated terror and systematic violence.<U+0094> Using a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches,and armed with freshly declassified archives from the Chinese provinces maintained by Communist Party officials,in addition to unexpurgated versions of important speeches by leaders,secret police reports,confessions,personal memoirs and eyewitness accounts,Dikˆtter takes the reader from the siege of Changchun by the People<U+0092>s Liberation Army strategist Lin Biao <U+0097> the last and most decisive battle between the Communists and Nationalists in 1948 <U+0097> through the land reforms,the thought reform campaigns and the collectivisation of agriculture to the Hundred Flowers Movement,culminating in the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957. It is a veritable trail of blood. Without let-up or pause,the reader is subjected to one horror story after another <U+0097> violence,torture,cruelty unleashed by the Party,and,worst of all,ordinary people being made complicit to the violence. Dikˆtter aims to show that Mao Zedong was responsible for it all. Like his earlier book,this one too provides no context,historical or cultural. For a century before the Communists came to prominence,there were upheavals,wars and exploitation. The Communist Party led by Mao successfully repelled colonialism and despite being the underdog,scored decisive victories against Japan and then the Chiang Kai-shek regime backed by the US and the USSR. This was war <U+0097> bitter,fierce and to the finish <U+0097> and the revolutionary struggle was no dinner party either. China under Mao<U+0092>s leadership decisively aligned with the Soviet Union against the capitalist bloc and embarked on the task of socialist industrialisation and modernisation under conditions of scarcity and backwardness,a process which has come under scrutiny by many scholars. Many accounts <U+0097> not all by apologists <U+0097> have critiqued the human cost and there can be no argument against examining the record of post-1949 People<U+0092>s Republic of China. But in Dikˆtter<U+0092>s retrospective account,everything is reduced to cynical manipulation by the Party. The single <U+0097> and dare one say simple-minded <U+0097> objective of demolishing Mao<U+0092>s revolutionary credentials and the Communist Party reduces the research to a compilation of ghastly stories. Mao<U+0092>s decision to intervene in the Korean War,a qualitatively different episode on account of the strategic and geopolitical circumstances (the nuclear threat from the US,the Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Straits),gets short shrift in Dikˆtter<U+0092>s rendition,only adding to the tally of Communist atrocities. Dikˆtter does not offer any explanation of his methodology,or how he computes numbers,often from descriptive records,to arrive at his approximate total. Neither does he generally offer graphical or tabular data by province or locality,as he does on page 269,where he provides a table showing the average annual consumption and living space for workers in Wuhan in 1953-57. His approach to statistics at times borders on the bizarre <U+0097> after providing two different figures on suicides by <U+0093>counter-revolutionaries<U+0094>,he expresses his preference for the higher number since it derives from someone who <U+0093>knew better.<U+0094> Dikˆtter is disinterested in nuances or even in asking whether brute force and terror were sufficient to keep the people not just subjugated but loyal too. He is not even aware of the immense irony when he says towards the end,<U+0093>[The key to understanding the appeal of communism,despite the grim reality on the ground,lay in the fact that it allowed so many followers to believe that they were participants in an historical process of transformation,contributing to something much bigger and better than themselves,or anything that had come before.<U+0094> And that something was going right somewhere as well; dozens of recent studies <U+0097> and again,they are not all by <U+0093>apologists<U+0094> <U+0097> testify that the foundations of China<U+0092>s immense growth over the past three decades were laid in the earlier era. By the time the Cultural Revolution had come and gone,the process to critically assess the Mao period had gotten underway in China <U+0097> earnestly. It helped that the new leadership under Deng Xiaoping had started the <U+0093>good Mao-bad Mao<U+0094> reassessment by providing a neat 70 to 30 per cent ratio. But that was way back in 1982,much before China had come to very nearly the centre of the global capitalist economy. Ansley J. Coale (1984) and Judith Banister<U+0092>s (1987) works had brought forth startling statistics about the death toll in the Great Leap Forward <U+0097> as high as 30 million. Many more books followed but,collectively,such narratives do not appear to promote a better understanding of China in the West. They highlight the continuing inability to think beyond binaries <U+0097> authoritarianism vs democracy,communism vs capitalism,free world vs those behind curtains of one sort or the other. The tendency to easily accept as gospel all that Dikˆtter offers would inevitably diminish the need to question and critique what really happened. Since the time the book appeared,the response,particularly from mainstream Western media and scholars,may be described as one collective gasp of horror at the idea of tens of millions of deaths as irrefutable reality (with a few notable exceptions). Dikˆtter<U+0092>s work is a powerful addition to the counter-narrative of the Maoist period. It needs to be taken seriously and refuted seriously. A rigorous and detailed critique (of the kind that Joseph Ball or Utsa Patnaik had provided of the methodology and calculation of the famine deaths during the Great Leap Forward) is needed to uncover the lacunae and problems in the way the archival records at the local level have been extrapolated to make generalisations and judgements about the provincial and national levels. Objective scholars need to separate fact from fiction and certitude from conjecture. The jury is still out.",Chinese Whispers | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/chinese-whispers-8/

I also read Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth by Reza Aslan. I<U+0092>d like to mention an Urdu book,which is quite disorganised,but has a wealth of information on Hindi and Urdu films: Hindustani Film ka Aghaaz-o-Irtiqa by Alif Ansari. And my favourite was Anthony Beevor<U+0092>s The Second World War. Viswanathan Anand. Chess grandmaster. I liked The Immortals of Meluha and The Oath of the Vayuputras by Amish Tripathi. It takes Indian mythology and builds on it. It takes a lot of familiar figures from our mythology,like Lord Shiva,and puts them in a new context. That I found very fascinating. Anand Gandhi. Filmmaker. Why do we feel fear,joy,anger,disgust,excitement or disdain? Why do we behave the way we do? Charles Darwin in The Origin of the Species,and his following works,made the first connection between natural selection and behavior patterns,and,hence,between evolution and the role of emotions in survival and reproduction. Yet,it took another century for evolutionary thinking to become the basis of studies in animal and human behaviour,and,consequently,of human interaction,relationships and society. It<U+0092>s been only a decade since the Human Genome Project gave us the first blueprint of the human species,and only a few years since the announcement of the Second Genome project of mapping the human microbiome <U+0097> the trillions of bacteria existing in the human body,endowing upon us traits the human genome did not evolve on its own. <U+0093>You think you are a person,but you are a colony.<U+0094> Dennis Bray,professor emeritus at the University of Cambridge,takes this investigation further in Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell with his studies of the behaviour of microbes <U+0097> how they <U+0093>decide<U+0094> where to swim,when to divide,and how best to manage the millions of chemical reactions taking place inside their membranes. Drawing parallels between computing,robotics and cell biology,Bray<U+0092>s Wetware offers an amusing and often enlightening,perspective on the <U+0093>thought process<U+0094> of some of our basic building blocks. A must read for seekers of answers. I read Lives Of A Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher by Lewis Thomas. It<U+0092>s a book on biology,which I thought would bore me to death,especially as it was recommended to me by a very intellectual person. However,I must say it is my favourite book of the year. Entertaining,informative,it tickles your mind,and by the end you realise it was about youÖ only by then you don<U+0092>t quite know how much of you is you! Read it now. Ritesh Batra. Filmmaker. I rediscovered the books of Michael Ondaatje,which I had read and loved years ago.

I got signed copies of Anil<U+0092>s Ghost and The Cat<U+0092>s Table from him,a real honour,and I read them again,it was as much a joy as when I had read them first. Currently,I am reading Julio Cort·zar<U+0092>s novel Hopscotch. It<U+0092>s an important novel that inspired many writers and has always been on my reading list.

Also The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins,it is very well written and deep for a Young Adult novel. Jerry Pinto. Author. I enjoyed Pankaj Mishra<U+0092>s prose in A Great Clamour: Encounters with China and its Neighbours. Mumbai finally has found its voice in the impassioned polemic of Naresh Fernandes<U+0092>s A City Adrift. Shanta Gokhale<U+0092>s Crowfall is one of the few books that looks at the city,the aftermath of the riots,the new art world and the intimacies that can still survive in our metropolis. That Adil Jussawalla should have produced a book of poems for younger readers is good news; we need more books that look children in the eye and acknowledge the gravitas of their lives. So his The Right Kind of Dog was another favourite. Then there was Brouhahas of Cocks by Mustansi Dalvi,a brilliant debut of an assured voice. Speaking of assured voices,Nilanjana Roy<U+0092>s promise in her first book came through magnificently in the second installment of the series: The Hundred Names of Darkness.

Now I have to read its prequel,The Siege. I also discovered Kate Atkinson with two books,When Will There Be Good News? and Case Histories,both amazingly different from the usual mystery format. Another satisfying book was Zadie Smith<U+0092>s Changing my Mind: Occasional Essays. Some brilliant essays there,specially those on EM Forster,Middlemarch,on the craft of writing and,yes,on Garbo and Hepburn. A thinking writer,this one. John le Carre<U+0092>s A Delicate Truth was a little disappointing,as was Barbara Kingsolver<U+0092>s Animal Dreams. Besides these,I read new books by old favourites <U+0097> Sue Grafton,Elizabeth George,John Grisham,none of which came up to the standard of their early books. Vishwajyoti Ghosh. Graphic novelist. Of the two books I really enjoyed recently,one is a collection of two novellas by Chetan Raj Shrestha,The King<U+0092>s Harvest. The stories take you on a road trip to places like Sikkim and Nepal,which I<U+0092>ve read so little about in contemporary literature. The other is a collection of long poems by Vinod Kumar Shukla,Kavita se Lambi Kavita. Long poems that are like free-flowing conversations,perceptive and observant,self-critical and subtly opinionated. Rohan Bopanna. Tennis Player. I have always been a huge fan of sport biographies,given the honesty with which they are written. The best book I have read this year has to be My Autobiography by Alex Ferguson,for the honesty in which he reveals the secrets of leading the world<U+0092>s most well-known football team. I particularly enjoyed reading his thoughts on staying motivated and his drive for new things. How he transformed his leadership style to adapt to the different generations of players that he worked with was very interesting. Derek O<U+0092> Brien. MP,Trinamool Congress. I read Jhumpa Lahiri<U+0092>s The Lowland and apart from all the literary reasons,I liked it because it was set in Kolkata,the places mentioned in the book are a stone<U+0092>s throw from where I live,where I go for morning walks. I also read The Harvest by Jim Crace. I liked it because it is a little off-beat,it made me forget the world of politics,quizzing,24X7 media. It is set in England so it has very nice imagery.

930,"Related. Halfway through Chapter 2,a discerning reader <U+0097> especially if she loves animals,with an extra fondness for cats <U+0097> will come to a realisation: the only way to read The Hundred Names of Darkness,Nilanjana Roy<U+0092>s sequel to The Wildings (2012),a tale about a clan of cats in New Delhi<U+0092>s historic Nizamuddin area,is to accept that,much like the first book,this one is also inconvenienced by the author<U+0092>s inability to see cats as four-legged felines,not quadruped humans. With an (unwilling) suspension of disbelief firmly in place,the reader can then move on,accepting this anthropocentric world in which animals are essentially humans in furry <U+0097> or winged <U+0097> form,with human vocabularies and personalities (including temper tantrums); if readers are particularly suggestible,they might even develop a fondness for the many cats and birds and dogs that traipse through the pages. The sequel cannot be read as a stand-alone book <U+0097> and this could prove a problem for those who have not read The Wildings. A few months after the great battle with the feral alpha cat Datura and his tribe,the worries of Katar,the Nizamuddin clan<U+0092>s elder,have come true: life is becoming harder for the clan. Once the danger of dog-catching vans,which were called in after the devastation of battle,had passed,the cats (and birds,squirrels and dogs) faced a new threat: rapid urbanisation. The old houses,the trees that offered both shelter and prey,and the parks have been ruthlessly obliterated to make way for towering buildings. The gentle fakir,friend to the Nizamuddin cats,had been forced to leave after the shrine he tended was demolished; without the food he shared,prey dwindling,and the increasingly belligerent Bigfeet <U+0097> the author<U+0092>s name for humans <U+0097> the cats have to survive a harsh winter and gear up for a cruel summer. The Sender,that cat of great power born only <U+0093>in the dark times,in the lean years<U+0094>,is the need of the hour. But where is she? Mara (who was introduced in The Wildings as the Sender) is a little older but not much wiser. About a year old but still a kitten at heart,she spends her days being petted and cuddled,and playing with her stuffed companions,a battered monkey and a catnip-filled mouse. She steps out into the wider world only through her virtual self,her <U+0093>sendings<U+0094>; her antennae <U+0097> her supersensitive,telepathic whiskers <U+0097> are how she keeps a protective eye on the antics of her friend Southpaw,or visits her tiger friend Ozzy at the zoo. But she will soon learn what being a Sender is about when Delhi<U+0092>s Circle of Senders <U+0097> Begum,the calico Speaker,the Sender from the banks of the Yamuna; Umrrow Jaan,the Mehrauli Sender; Jalebi of Chandni Chowk; Baoli of Hauz Khas; and Spook of the Embassy area <U+0097> summons her to a meet. Mara<U+0092>s virtual self leaves the Circle with a growing realisation of her powers and responsibilities. as a Sender. The characters from The Wildings are back: the lovely black-and-white Beraal (Bengali for <U+0093>cat<U+0094>) is now nursing her two kittens; Katar,lean and grey as an Èminence grise,injured in battle and Bigfeet cruelty; the black tom Hulo,as battered and independent,and as disdainful of the young Sender; Kirri the mongoose,a chance encounter with whom leaves Mara aware of herself as a predator; and Tooth the cheel (eagle),who led his squadron against Datura<U+0092>s division in the first book and upon whom the cats depend more than ever. All this appears inventive,but possessed ailurophiles (such as myself) will find the anthropomorphism first noted in The Wildings more pronounced here. Thus,a peacock and assorted cats with the inflexion and mannerisms of stereotypical Colonels Bogeys of the British Army; young cheels who behave and mumble like sulky human teenagers; a gabby cat with a love of gossip; a cobra who<U+0092>s out to avenge the death of his mate; a cat who thinks nothing of taking on <U+0097> and killing <U+0097> powerful cobras. But,despite its roster of eccentrics,what marks the sequel is its slow pace. After the relentless,frenetic action in The Wildings,it seems to drag its paws. The travails of the Nizamuddin clan are prolix,the details a procession of plaints against <U+0093>human<U+0094> love of development at huge cost to other species. On the other hand,Mara<U+0092>s grand plan to shift the clan to greener pastures,which had the makings of a resounding climax,is dealt with hurriedly,affording one no satisfaction.",Purrs of Wisdom | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/purrs-of-wisdom/
931,"Related. A day after the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan appointed IAS officer Krishna Kunal to the post of Jaipur District Collector (DC), activists and minority groups appealed in a letter to the CM, that Kunal, who was collector of Bharatpur during the Gopalgarh firing, be immediately removed from the post. Kunal was suspended on September 2011 along with then SP Hinglaj Dan by the Ashok Gehlot government for failing to control the communal riots in Gopalgarh, in which ten Meo Muslims were killed. Kunal was kept on Await Posting Orders for two years post the incident, during which he approached the Central Administrative Tribunal contesting his suspension. In March 2012, the Tribunal stayed his suspension, observing that the state had failed to issue an inquiry. Kunal was then posted as the settlement commissioner before being brought back as Jaipur DC Thursday. Reacting sharply to the appointment, 14 activists from NGOs and pressure groups wrote to Raje seeking Kunalís removal. They said they were ìsaddenedî by the appointment and claimed that it was due to the ìconnivanceî of Kunal and SP Dan that 10 Muslims were killed in the Jama Masjid of Gopalgar on September 14, 2011. ìAbout forty persons were injured and houses and shops were burnt and looted by a mob while the district administration watched with glee,î the letter read. ìUnder political and social pressure and criticism, he (Gehlot) suspended both the DM and SP. However, the then bureaucracy successfully protected them,î it said.

933,"Related. ZEESHAN SHAIKH: Can you explain BESTís cross-subsidy model? Earlier, the tramways used to support the electric supply as electricity was subsidised then. After the 1960s, when the use of electricity rose significantly, the electric supply started subsidising the transport side. It went on well until 2003, when the Electricity Act came in. The interpretation of the the Electricity Act, 2003, by the regulator created trouble when it barred cross-subsidies. After that we approached the Supreme Court, which agreed that there was a provision in the Act and hence cross-subsidy is not directly barred. Then MERC gave an order and today, the cross-subsidy model is still on. ZEESHAN SHAIKH: How do you think a fare revision will be possible when the trend seems to be to roll it back? In the past three years, fares revision has been allowed three times. If fare revision is not allowed and services are not run, it doesnít help. So, eventually one has to find a balance whereby you say that allow us at least this much money to run services. The aim is also to provide cheap and good transport to the public. MAYURA JANWALKAR: What was the purpose behind proposing such an amendment that will disallow the BEST from cross-subsidising? Does BEST gain from this? Iím not sure why it is being proposed. In the case of Mumbai, this is not in public interest. The amendments are unwarranted. The original drafts did not have these provisions. Lawmakers draft laws based on their own understanding and interpretation. If the person in the chair interpreting the law does not have the same ideas, there are bound to be problems. Private entrepreneurship in essential services is good as long as there is no profiteering. If profit becomes an important motive in essential services, consumers are at the mercy of the private party. P VAIDYANATHAN IYER : In the larger issue of competition bringing down tarrifs and offering cheaper services as seen in the telecom and aviation sectors, why do you think electricity should be an exception? In aviation, choices are multiple. You can choose not to fly as there are other modes of transport available. In telecom, the technology brings down the tariffs. But in electricity, you cannot move on to a second supplier immediately, as seen in the suburban Mumbai experience. Here, competition has visibly not helped lower tariffs. The other issue is cartelisation. P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: But there are institutions in place for addressing these issues. Why should the consumer accept you as the only choice for such a service? The average, basic idea in a public institution such as BEST or state utility is that the accounts are audited. There can be inefficiency in the system but there cannot be a wrong statement of accounts for profiteering. In essential services, this is one aspect that must be kept in mind. So when you talk about bringing in competition, if there are five entities coming in as private players for the supply business, itís fine but if you are replacing a public utility with a private monopoly, it is helping no one. How do you ensure public interest in the long run? ZEESHAN SHAIKH: How much would the fares have to increase for the transport undertaking to be self-sustainable? In the current fiscal, there is a gap of around Rs 450 crore at a revenue of about Rs 1,600 crore, which is a 25 per cent increase in the present revenue. Now, 50 per cent of the revenue comes from minimum fares. Today, the minimum fare is Rs 6, which we have proposed to raise to Rs 7. If we raise it to Rs 10, BEST will be able to take care of its finances. However, we cannot impose such a large hike at one go. Our base mainly consists of economically weaker sections who would then have to spend more than 25 per cent of their income on commuting. As per international standards, citizens should not have to pay more than two-three per cent of their income on travel. At present, we spend around 15 per cent. ZEESHAN SHAIKH : Two new transport systems ó Metro and Monorail ó will be launched this year. Will this help BEST or compound its problems? It will create several problems. In the present Metro line, there is not enough space to load and unload buses. Thus, the congestion may go up in certain areas. At present, east-west connectivity is through buses. Once the Metro line is functional, we will have to plan all the operations again so that our services run perpendicular to the Metro. We are already relocating many bus stops through Station Area Development and are working with MMRDA and BMC, in consultation with the traffic police department. If all of this had been planned in the first place, it would have been easier. SHARVARI PATWA: The BMC recently hiked parking rates to promote public transport and reduce congestion by private vehicles. Do you think this is a solution? Increasing parking charges is not going to deter a car owner from parking the car there. They will be willing to pay even Rs 100. Peak-hour parking rates in other cities are also high. The concept is clear ó the road is not for car parking. People can easily afford our ëhikedí charges and I donít see any increase in passenger load on BEST. ALISON SALDANHA: There are an increasing number of road accidents caused by negligence or rash driving by BEST bus drivers. How does this figure in BESTís plan to improve services? The number of accidents involving BEST buses has come down drastically. In 1989-1990, the number of people who died due to BEST buses was around 90. In 2012, the number of deaths was 26, which is also unacceptable. But in Mumbai, at least the numbers have not increased. If we analyse the accidents, 50 per cent of them are caused by jaywalking and lane-cutting. Overall in India, 70 per cent of accidents happen due to the driverís mistakes but in BEST buses, this number is less than 20 per cent. We give drivers refresher training and organise sessions with Brahmakumaris centres to relieve stress. ALISON SALDANHA: Are the drivers penalised for rash driving?Drivers involved in fatal accident cases are dismissed. After this, the person has to prove his innocence. This is a big deterrent. That is why BEST accidents numbers are lower than other cities. BEST drivers get full-fledged training for four months in Dindoshi. They are given classroom training and hands-on training on the bus. MAYURA JANWALKAR: To what extent does the poor quality of Mumbaiís roads affect maintenance? In the monsoon, the breakdown rate goes up by nearly 20 per cent. Maintenance is not the only issue, you end up losing revenue, schedules get disturbed, manpower costs go up. Overall, cost addition in monsoon is much more than 20 per cent.

934,"Related. Mehbooba Mufti explains why while A B Vajpayee was one of the most respected PMs in the state,her party would never align with the BJP. In this Idea Exchange moderated by Editor (Legal Affairs) Maneesh Chhibber,the PDP president also expresses disappointment with Rahul Gandhi,says AAP should be given a chance to prove itself and claims that J&K has come to hate the Omar government. Maneesh Chhibber: There are rumours that you are joining hands with the BJP. I will talk about a recent statement. The Chief Minister went to Jammu and said that the PDP is a Pakistani party,look at their flagÖ But what Omar Abdullah says,his father doesn<U+0092>t. Coming to the point,we have always praised Atal Bihari Vajpayee,because whatever changes we see in Jammu and Kashmir today,were because of him <U+0097> whether his going to Lahore or inviting Pervez Musharraf after Kargil. After we took over in 2002 and Vajpayee came to Kashmir,he said a few touching words: <U+0091>I am going to resolve the Kashmir issue and I extend my hand of friendship to Pakistan.<U+0092> We have worked with the NDA without being their alliance partner,in contrast to the National Conference. They kicked out Saifuddin Soz when he voted against the BJP. Then Omar became a minister in the Vajpayee government; the NC was present when Godhra happened. Farooq Abdullah was the only one who defended Narendra Modi. Their breaking point came when Vajpayee announced that they were going to have a time-frame for polls,which the NC did not expect because their experience of having an alliance with the party at the Centre was something different. When they formed an alliance with the Congress,they were able to manipulate the Congress leadership in Delhi to rig the Srinagar elections. The PDP stands for more empowerment,self-rule and other things for the resolution of the Kashmir problem. The BJP has an aversion to Article 370. I don<U+0092>t think there is. a meeting point between us. and them. Rakesh Sinha: What is your view on Narendra Modi? I find Modi very authoritative. He seems to be growing much more than the party. Perhaps people are looking for someone assertive and authoritative. Perhaps that<U+0092>s why his stock is growing. I hope and pray that what people say about him,that he is divisive,is not true,especially after he is standing for the prime minister<U+0092>s post. I hope that he is able to prove people wrong by acting differently and allowing them to forget the unfortunate Gujarat incident. Coomi Kapoor: Do you think there is a possibility of an Aam Aadmi Party coming up in Jammu and Kashmir? For Kashmir the AAP experiment happened way back in 1987,because the Congress and the NC joined hands and people were tired of corruption. All these young guys <U+0097> Salahuddin,Yasin Malik,Ashfaq Majid <U+0097> got together and at that point a kind of jubilation was seen. I appreciate Vajpayee. In spite of being an alliance partner with the NC,he did not allow them to manipulate elections. But Farooq Abdullah was able to get the polls rigged. Elections even now are not seen as being free. What becomes an issue in the country doesn<U+0092>t become an issue when it happens in Kashmir. The Congress has set up a committee for snoopgate. But when a person is alleged to have died because of a party at the CM<U+0092>s place,where talk of money was going on,what about that? Recently we had an officer on the board of professional examination who was given half a dozen extensions,and the high court intervened when it was said that he was selling medical college seats for Rs 60-80 lakh each. If this had happened anywhere else in the country,it would have caught the attention of the media. We had a drug scam,but nobody did anything about it. Naveed Iqbal: Since the Omar Abdullah government came to power,there seems to be no opposition to what he does or says,whether inside the Assembly or outside. We have a young CM and you are recruiting 400 retired bureaucrats for high posts. We have been opposing his policy of re-employment and giving extensions. There is hardly any governance; electricity is very bad. Sometimes we talk and talk and people are on the streets protesting for electricity,water. Then we too get tired of criticising the government. Nayeem Showkat Khan: Can you define self-rule? Self-rule has three-four basic points and all those have been endorsed by the working group. First,lift the siege from this state,from all routes <U+0097> Muzaffarabad,Rawalakot,Kailash-Mansarovar yatra <U+0097> so that Kashmir becomes a gateway to central and south Asia. The other issue is water resources and power projects. Most of our projects have been taken by the NHPC. What we get in return is minimal. We have done our homework and it comes to Rs 30-50 thousand crores every year. If we negotiate the losses,it gives us an amount which can be used for infrastructure. The third is that we need a joint mechanism between the two Kashmirs. We can have a joint advisory council,where representatives from both sides can meet at least twice a year. This has been endorsed by the working group where the BJP,NC and the Congress were present. There is hardly any place in Kashmir where you don<U+0092>t have graveyards for young people <U+0097> whether militants or security forces <U+0097> and you can<U+0092>t sweep it away. If we have a joint advisory council,it will give people a symbol of hope. The fourth point is that we would like to have an elected governor,once each from Jammu,Kashmir and Ladakh. We would like to have 90 per cent officers from the state. I would like to see J&K become a model of SAARC corporation. If it becomes a free zone,let us have a currency. We are talking about self-rule within the parameters of the Constitution. I can<U+0092>t imagine what sort of day it will be when we take a bus from Srinagar and in 18 hours we are in China. We can go from Kargil to Iran to Haj. Y P RAJESH: You think the India-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir has made progress under the UPA government or was it better under the NDA? The hardest part was started by Vajpayee. Even after Kargil and Parliament attack,the dialogue process started,there was ceasefire and confidence building. Unfortunately,things changed thereafter. But definitely in UPA-II we haven<U+0092>t seen much progress. The Pakistan foreign ministry and secretaries met and spoke about issues,travelled across Rawalakot,and spoke about banking facilities,but nothing moved on ground. Prawesh Lama: In the next few months,if Modi comes to power and AAP in Delhi,how will things change in the Valley in terms of policies,expectations of the people? Even the Kashmir valley is celebrating this change. In the Valley,mainstream politics is seen as untouchable,it is considered a bad thing. Because of AAP<U+0092>s victory,it may not be considered a bad thing now. Modi has a mixed response,because it is a Muslim-majority state and some people do remember the unfortunate incident in Gujarat. Not that communal riots have not happened before or after that,but its representation in terms of what we have seen has made an impact. There is a section of people who think that Modi will be able to take certain tough decisions,because when Vajpayee took certain decisions,nobody could question him. Maneesh Chhibber: At a rally in Jammu,Modi spoke about Article 370,and many viewed it as a change in the BJP<U+0092>s stance. The PDP<U+0092>s opposition to Modi and the BJP has been because of their anti-370 stance. If the BJP dilutes that stance,do you think there can be a re-look to your opposition? When we came to power,we did not have an alliance with the BJP,but we were able to get maximum things done under Vajpayee<U+0092>s rule. We got a package to promote tourism; we got Rs 660 crore for electricity. But as far as an alliance is concerned,the BJP is a no-no. Coomi Kapoor: Assembly polls are due in Kashmir next year. Is there a possibility that you would ally with the Congress after the results are out? When we made an alliance with the Congress,there was a proper common minimum programme. It was not an alliance out of the blue. When we formed the government,nobody believed that the PDP could do what it had promised people <U+0097> finish task force,stop bloodshed. You could not use a mobile phone in J&K during the NC regime. Our tunnel would shut at 5 pm. When we reopened the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road,security people told Mufti sahab,<U+0091>Ö wahan se toh millitants ayenge<U+0092>. Everything we did,there was another angle to it. We formed the government with the Congress; our common minimum programme was successful. At this point of time the two Jamats are hand in hand and both are looting everything. There is no limit or account of corruption. If one Jamat<U+0092>s minister is stuck in a drug scam,the other<U+0092>s is in a jungle scam. Right now in Jammu and Kashmir there<U+0092>s an anti-alliance,anti-government anger. Unni Rajen Shanker: From what you said there is a lot of nostalgia for Vajpayee and some optimism for Modi. So to have an alliance,is something possible? Have they reached out to you? As far as Vajpayee is concerned,it<U+0092>s not just mine,it<U+0092>s a general perception in the Valley. Whenever an Indian PM came to Kashmir,people shut shops,put up black flags. But when he came,nothing like that happened. And he reciprocated it. Also,because every time a PM came to Kashmir,they would talk about Pakistan,saying <U+0091>we will teach you (Pakistan) a lesson<U+0092>. He said,<U+0093>Main insaniyat ke daayre mein baat karunga. Main Pakistan se dosti karunga.<U+0094> That<U+0092>s why people respect him. When militancy was at its peak,he went to Lahore. The same day, seven Hindu boys were killed. When we talk to people,including the extremely staunch ones,they say that in matters of Kashmir,Modi will be able to do something because nobody is going to question his authority. Rakesh Sinha: What<U+0092>s your impression of Rahul Gandhi? I feel that Rahul Gandhi could have been the face of the anti-corruption movement <U+0097> something we<U+0092>ve been seeing for the last four-five years since he got a platform. Rahul Gandhi is a young leader,his party is big; leaving the UPA-I aside,by the UPA-II,he should have woken up. Take Anna Hazare<U+0092>s fast against corruption,something that an old man is doing,he should have been doing that. No offence meant,but he can<U+0092>t have a Sheila ki jawani number in a flop film. If pressure begins to build up,you talk about passing an ordinance; if pressure builds up,you talk about the Lokpal Bill. You have to be consistent and constant. Muhammad Zulqarnain Zulfi: You<U+0092>ve been talking about Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) removal from the very beginning. But in 1990,AFSPA was implemented in J&K by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. From 2002,you claimed that militancy is low. Why weren<U+0092>t measures taken for the removal of AFSPA then? When Mufti Mohammad became the Home Minister and militancy started in thousands,AFSPA was enforced and confined to the Valley. In 1996 polls,the NC got a majority and extended it to Jammu province,Rajouri,Poonch,Chenab valley. They also got POTA (Prevention of Terrorism Act). Once we came to power,POTA was revoked. Now with the number of militants going down,black laws will also have to go Ö since the militant numbers have gone down,the security forces are doing fake encounters. That<U+0092>s why a defence committee was set up by the Defence Minister. They said,<U+0091>give us six months and we will revoke AFSPA<U+0092>. Unfortunately,another government came and now it<U+0092>s going on just like that. Aniruddha Ghoshal: Rahul Gandhi is trying to appear to be the face of the anti-corruption movement. Do you think it<U+0092>s too late? It looks like a guest appearance. The young guys have nothing to lose. The older politicians think we are in our last leg,we won<U+0092>t live much. But he is a young guy,he could have done that. He comes in the middle of things,says things,of which,I think,there is no credibility. Sudhakar Jagdish: Say Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal contest from the same seat,who would you vote for? I can<U+0092>t say because we are still watching Arvind Kejriwal. I will see how he performs in Delhi. I<U+0092>m sure he is going to perform because he has calculated everything. We need to give him some time. Sudhakar Jagdish: How do you see the High Court judgment that gave Modi a clean chit on Godhra riots? When riots like these happen,it<U+0092>s not about your criminality,it is about morality. Modi wasn<U+0092>t there himself with a gun. He was the CM. There is a responsibility. Ravish Tiwari: Do you feel that NOTA (none of the above) will expose both the NC and the PDP,showing that they don<U+0092>t have support in the Valley. And if the separatists decide to use it,will it become a plebiscite? I have said this before that whatever is reformative in our country,we are scared of implementing it in Kashmir. NOTA is very good,though it doesn<U+0092>t result in anything. But there are apprehensions about Kashmir. That means 65 years down the line,we are still where we were in 1947. Maneesh Chhibber: When you were here the last time,you spoke about Omar Abdullah. Next year,you are going to face elections. Omar<U+0092>s government seems to have an opinion on everything except what he should be doing in the state. What are the things you think he should have done? The worst failure of this government has been the disconnect with the youth. When he became the CM,everyone thought that he<U+0092>s young,he has something positive about it,though people had bad views on the NC in general. The unfortunate part is that people have died during these five years. Casualties have been mostly civilians,majority of them youth and students,with no connection with militancy. People who were booked were innocent. This must be the first government that used palette guns,used for animals,against the youth. The boys who got hit in the eye,if they go to the doctor,there will be a police case, their names will be registered. Kashmir is the only state and this is the only government using chilli grenades. We have a small population,very few government jobs,and you give Rs 1.5-2 lakh to 400 retired people. Kashmir<U+0092>s people have begun to hate him.","People believe that on Kashmir,Modi will be able to do something: Mehbooba | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/people-believe-that-on-kashmir-modi-will-be-able-to-do-something-mehbooba/
935,"Related. Retd Delhi HC Chief Justice and the man behind a landmark verdict decriminalising homosexuality,Justice A P Shah feels the Supreme Court setting aside that order is unfortunate. At this Idea Exchange moderated by Senior Editor (Legal Affairs) Maneesh Chhibber,he also talks about his new assignment as Law Commission chief,where he is looking into electoral reforms,live-in relationships and age of juvenility. Maneesh Chhibber: Can you explain how you wrote your Section 377 judgment? I wouldn<U+0092>t like to comment on the Supreme Court judgment but that doesn<U+0092>t bar me from speaking about the rights of LGBTs,the Constitutional morality we talked about in the high court case,and the government<U+0092>s position. Let me start with this <U+0097> some speak of this as a <U+0091>western disease<U+0092>. First of all,it is not western. Temple imagery and essential scriptures show there is some evidence of homosexuality being practised in this countryÖ The British brought in Section 377 and there is the presumption that one of the reasons was (they feared) their army and daughters would be tainted by Oriental vicesÖ What is so startling is that Section 377 travelled back to England. Later it was repealed,in the sense that their judicial committee recommended that for consenting adults it should not be a crime. This is the position in almost all of Europe,US. There are critical nuances of the (Supreme Court) judgment which I would not like to go into,but I would like to tell you about how far it is permissible for the State to legislate on the ground of public morality. What is envisaged by the Constitution is not popular morality. Probably public morality is the reflection of the moral normative values of the majority of the population,but Constitutional morality derives its contents from the values of the Constitution. For instance,untouchability was approved by the majority,but the Constitution prohibited untouchability as a part of social engineering. Sati was at one time approved by the majority,but in today<U+0092>s world,it would be completely inconsistent with the ConstitutionÖ In public morality and Constitutional morality,there might be meeting points. For instance,gambling. That would be prohibited by law,and that<U+0092>s also the perception of public morality. I think the real answer to this debate is Constitutional morality. And this is the most important point <U+0097> it has to be traced to the counter-majoritarian role of the judiciary. A modern democracy is based on two principles <U+0097> of majority rule and the need to protect fundamental rights. The very purpose of fundamental rights is to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy,to place them beyond the reach of majorities,and establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. It is the job of the judiciary to balance the principles ensuring that the government on the basis of numbers does not override fundamental rights. I would like to refer to my own notes and preparation. In case of a moral legislation,when it is being reviewed by a Constitutional court,then the rule of <U+0091>majority rules<U+0092> should not count,because if the issue of morality is to be decided by the majority,as represented by the legislature and Parliament,then the fundamental right has no meaning. It is to be decided on the basis of Constitutional values and not majority rule. About homosexuality being a diseaseÖ this is no longer treated as a disease or a disorder. There is near unanimous medical,psychiatric opinion that it is just another expression of human sexuality. With this,I come to the last part,that <U+0091>What is the harm to the LGBT (with this law),that ultimately these provisions are not enforced<U+0092>. It is true that in the last 150 years there might have been 200 prosecutionsÖ But even when these provisions are not enforced,they reduce sexual minorities to <U+0097> what one author (in a US judgment) has referred to <U+0097> <U+0091>unapprehended felons<U+0092>. Apart from the misery and fear,a few more of the consequences of such laws are to legitimise and encourage blackmail,police and private violence,and discrimination. We could see some evidence that was placed before us,what is called the <U+0091>Lucknow incident<U+0092>. This was a support group to create awareness about AIDS etc,they were arrested,and although they should have been released on bail immediately,they remained in custody for more than two months because of Section 377. Rakesh Sinha: What was the first thought that crossed your mind when the Supreme Court overturned your ruling? That it is unfortunate. Coomi Kapoor: One reason for the conservativeness of the judgments of courts may be the ages of the judges. I was 62,about to retire (at the time he gave the Section 377. judgment). Seema Chishti: Do you think the big mistake in the rush for criminal law amendment in the wake of the December 16 gangrape was to not make it gender neutral? If that was made gender neutral,and you recognised man to man harassment,it would take away the need for 377? There was an urgent need to make certain changes in the existing rape laws,there cannot be two opinions on that. I think it was touched with haste. Not only were there some lacunae but also it should have gone beyond the provisions which they made. Perhaps the government was not prepared to commit to the other reforms suggested by the Justice Verma committee. Seema Chishti: Given the public mood to <U+0091>clean up<U+0092> things,the Lokpal is being seen as a very important tool. Do you think we are running into a problem? We anyway had a problem about judges appointing themselves,and now we have a Lokpal who sits in judgment over elected persons. Who is going to monitor the monitors? When the idea of appointing a Lokpal was mooted,it was on the lines of the institution of ombudsman in many countries. Ombudsman is not necessarily an anti-corruption body,it<U+0092>s about good governance. In India,administrative committees<U+0092> reports found that this institution was necessary to fight corruption in high places. We have made a sort of an amalgamation of ombudsman and anti-corruption body,with more emphasis on anti-corruption. I have seen the Bills,appeared before the select committee of the present Lokpal Bill,and had seen the Jan Lokpal Bill conceived by Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan. The Jan Lokpal Bill,I feel,is creating a monster. The first thing is accountability. The other ombudsman institutions are accountable to Parliament,to the legislature. If you create an institution which is neither accountable to the executive nor the legislature,there will be no system of checks and balances. The Lokpal Bill is not as strong as the Jan Lokpal Bill; thankfully,it<U+0092>s a much more balanced. The whole idea of the CBI being placed under the control of the Lokpal is not really a bright idea. You should not make one institution so strong that it can override all other institutions and constitutional systems. Seema Chishti: And the judges appointing themselves? Now,there is a Bill,but it is nothing new. In 1990,such a Bill was introduced by Dinesh Goswami. Unfortunately,the government had to go. There have been two reports of the Law Commission suggesting that there should be a judicial commission. In a 1993 judgment,the Supreme Court read the word <U+0091>consultation<U+0092> to mean <U+0091>concurrence<U+0092>,and this is how the primacy is vested in the Chief Justice of India. It has been very strongly criticised. First,it<U+0092>s not transparent,and second,there is no input about the ability of a possible candidate because it<U+0092>s only a judges<U+0092> committee,sitting in a closed room deciding about appointments,elevations,more like a club. It has encouraged a lot of sycophancy. Thankfully,the government has brought the Bill. Prawesh Lama: There have been cases of rape law being misused. Recently,an NGO director committed suicide after being accused of assault. Should there be a mechanism to ensure laws aren<U+0092>t misused? It is Indian tendency to give knee-jerk reactions. After the episode of December 2012,there were reactions. We go to extremes and forget rationality. Also,these laws will not work unless we have police reforms and judicial reforms simultaneously. What is the use of a very strict law if police are lacking in integrity or are inefficient? Aneesha Mathur: The Delhi High Court has consistently given judgments saying that there should be a re-look at how police are dealing with these laws. Even in the Section 377 judgment,the Supreme Court said that exactly defining an unnatural act is not possible,and we<U+0092>ll have to see how the courts deal with it. What can the judiciary do to ensure there<U+0092>s no misuse? The judiciary has its limitations. I know of half a dozen judgments of the Supreme Court on improving the present conditions,but there is no change in the situation. One of the criticisms labelled against PIL jurisdiction is that judiciary has to rely on the good faith of the executive. Have the orders passed on PILs changed the lives of ordinary Indians? Judiciary is no substitute for political activism or for legislative processes. Krishna UPPULURI*: India<U+0092>s Deputy Consul General in New York Devyani Khobragade has been arrested as per the US laws. Can we use Indian laws to prosecute homosexual diplomats? This would be going beyond the diplomatic limits. Utkarsh Anand: Do you think Justice A K Ganguly should step down? I should not talk on this issue. Utkarsh Anand: A Supreme Court Committee was constituted to inquire into the allegations against him. Should the committee have indicted him while simultaneously saying that we don<U+0092>t have jurisdiction over retired judges? It was a critical situation for the court. When something leaked in the media,the whole institution came under a cloud. What he was saying is absolutely correct because,even as per the Vishakha guidelines,the case would not fall within the powers of the Supreme Court Committee. But if the committee had simply said that it has no jurisdiction,it would have reflected very badly on the institution. I think the committee was right,the three judges were right. I read the order as an assurance to the people that the institution cares for these matters,though they can<U+0092>t take any action. Maneesh Chhibber: One of the biggest problems of the judiciary is that it is a most exclusive club. Any transparency law,they are the last ones to implement it. Don<U+0092>t you think this hurts the institution? I think transparency is the hallmark of any judiciary. All administrative decisions taken by the court should be on the website <U+0097> how much is spent by the institution,how many cases are disposed of. All this information,and not only about pendency and disposal by the judges but also the entire functioning of the court should be in the public domain. Ankita Mahendru*: What is your view on the legal process followed by the US in the arrest of Devyani Khobragade. What I read in your newspaper is that this is the standard procedure. Where we are really missing the point is about the victim. What about the maid? Amulya Gopalakrishnan: A lot of feminist activists want the rape law to be made gender specific for the victim and gender neutral for the perpetrator. Parliament did not do that. A lot of men who are raped are left out. Is it possible to draft a law like that? The existing provisions can be slightly amended so as to make them gender neutral. The draft is not bad,it can be improved. Vandita Mishra: Over the past few years,there has been a weakening of the political executive and the legislature. Parliament has not functioned as it should have. That has led to the judiciary overreaching in many cases. Do you think there are dangers to this? After the Emergency,the judiciary took up the role of a protector of human rights of the marginalised and the disadvantaged. If you look at the PILs entertained by courts in those times,they were in the nature of social action,social interest litigation,not really a PIL. Slowly,the court expanded its jurisdiction and then we had (PILs on) good governance,corruption-free government or the rule of law,judicial appointments. But what happened after 2001 is that you could file a PIL about anything under the sun. Many of these PILs are not connected with human rights issues and that is the real danger. Some of the PILs entertained were about monkey menace,sealing of shops,traffic management or role of tourists in wildlife sanctuary. Just see to what extent courts have gone into policymaking. One example is the river linking case. Almost all experts said that it is not feasible. In spite of that,the court issued directions. Nothing happened thereafter,that is a different issue. Judicial activism is for issues for which there was earlier a legislative solution. This could be almost touching judicial imperialism or judicial adventurism. The other problem is the creeping eliticism in the judiciary. I was shocked to see so much concern about the occupants of the Campa Cola building among the media and judiciary. What about the thousands of families who,for some beautification of the city and Commonwealth Games,are asked to move 20 km away from Delhi? Maneesh Chhibber: In its review petition in the Section 377 case,the Centre is saying that while lawmaking is the sole responsibility of Parliament,it<U+0092>s the task of the court to judge the constitutional validity of laws. Isn<U+0092>t the executive ceding to the judiciary? The court has to decide when it comes to a human rights issue. But if it is a policy matter,the legislature has precedence. If the Delhi High Court was right in its conclusion that there is violation of Articles 14,15 and 19 and 21 <U+0097> if that is the position <U+0097> then it is the court which could deal with it,even if there is no amendment in the law. But that does not absolve the government from taking the call and making the amendment. They could have done it when the laws were changed in the wake of the Delhi gangrape case. There might be a lack of political will. Rakesh Sinha: There is an ongoing debate on the age of juvenility. But child rights workers have concerns too. We have taken it up,appointed an experts<U+0092> committee in the Law Commission. Muzamil Jaleel: What is your view on amendments in the UAPA or the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. I have spoken against these laws several times. I feel that certain rights should not be compromised. It is the burden of democratic countries that they have to deal with the problem of terrorism,and they have to fight it with one arm tied down. Prawesh Lama: Shouldn<U+0092>t police officers be punished when they arrest an innocent person and brand him a terrorist? Apart from action against the concerned police officers,we should have laws to give some remedy to the person who has been wronged by the system.","ëIf an issue of morality is to be decided by majority,then fundamental right has no meaningí | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/if-an-issue-of-morality-is-to-be-decided-by-majority-then-fundamental-right-has-no-meaning/
936,"Related. At this Idea Exchange,tennis ace Leander Paes talks about how rural India or small towns can produce champions,his plans to open sports science centres,how he keeps himself fit at 40,and his interest in films. The session was moderated by Senior Sports Correspondent Mihir Vasavda. Mihir Vasavda: You,Sachin Tendulkar and Viswanathan Anand were born around the same time and your careers also virtually kicked off simultaneously in 1988-89. And this year,you won your 14th grand slam,Sachin played his 200th Test match,and Vishy fought for his world championship title. What<U+0092>s with this coincidence? I think we need to ask our parents (laughs). There<U+0092>s something unique about longevity of all of us. I think that comes from the passion for the game. For me,my passion for fitness,health and lifestyle is all tailor-made to the goals I have. Over a span of 25 years,I have reached 31 grand slam finals. As much as people talk about the wins,I am looking at the consistency of excellence. To me,that<U+0092>s more important. At some point I know my days will be done. There will be a youngster who<U+0092>ll say <U+0091>I<U+0092>ve got you,I<U+0092>m better than you<U+0092>. We talk about 1973 being a great year,maybe there was a <U+0092>93 that will be a great year and that kid is just getting ready to turn pro. Sandeep Dwivedi: How important is it to choose your doubles partner? Do you think that people who don<U+0092>t get along,who aren<U+0092>t the best of friends,can be great doubles partners? Yes,they can. I<U+0092>ve had 95 doubles partners in men<U+0092>s game alone and I have not personally chosen each one of them. I may have chosen 77-78 of them. In life,there are certain chance meetings that happen. What<U+0092>s important is to understand the other person<U+0092>s strengths and weaknesses. So,when you get into that work environment,just to get that underlying trust,to say that today we<U+0092>re going to partner each other and I<U+0092>ve got your back no matter what happens <U+0097> whether we win or lose,whether we make ourselves look silly on the centre court of Wimbledon with a million people watching us on television,or whether it<U+0092>s to tease each other. When you get to understand the nuances of somebody,that<U+0092>s friendship. But when it turns into business,you use that friendship <U+0097> and <U+0091>use<U+0092> is not necessarily a bad terminology <U+0097> you use that underlying understanding,that bond,the relationship to bring out the best in the other person. Sandeep Dwivedi: How do you look back at your relationship with Mahesh Bhupathi? I am a complete optimist. With anything in life,I choose to look at the positives in it. The best thing that we did as two young men was we proved that as Indians,we can be world beaters. We proved that. Many people believed we could not win grand slams,but we went out there and won. We were World No. 1 and everyone was chasing us in the record books to win four grand slams or be in four grand slam finals in the same year. Srinath Rao: How much of yourself and Mahesh do you see in Bryan brothers? I think they are the best doubles pair. The reason I believe they are the best doubles team ever is that bio-mechanically and technically they are the soundest team that could have been born like that. They have an unbelievable understanding of where they stand on the court. Some people don<U+0092>t know who<U+0092>s Bob and who<U+0092>s Mike because they look alike. To me,the Bryans are greater than the Woodies,Hesh and myself,(Jacco) Eltingh and (Paul) Haarhuis,and McEnroe and Fleming because of their excellence over such a longevity of time. The reason I hold them at a notch a little higher is also because of their brotherhood. They get through tough times and adversity as well,always sticking together. Shubhangi Khapre: Personally,which has been a more satisfying and challenging win <U+0097> singles at Olympics or doubles at grand slams? I think achieving my Olympic medal was the most challenging. Because most people look at it as one match. For me,it was a whole lifetime of preparing for it. I think the Olympic medal stands for so much in my family. Each and every person in my family played a part for me to get there. It<U+0092>s really hard to explain the amount of things that go into achieving one piece of bronze. Bharat Sundaresan: You spoke about the 95 male partners you<U+0092>ve had,but how different is it or what is it that you look for in a mixed doubles partner? I have played with roughly 23 mixed doubles partners. There are certain aspects of personality where women are million times better than we guys can be. Their intuitiveness is phenomenal. I can use Martina<U+0092>s intuition on,<U+0091>Hey where do you think this serve<U+0092>s going?<U+0092>. I can<U+0092>t tell you the number of times I<U+0092>ve asked her on a big point because return of serve is not my strength. I would ask,<U+0091>Marty where is this serve going?<U+0092>. And you will not believe how many times she<U+0092>s right. Just by knowing a fraction of a second earlier about where the ball<U+0092>s coming,and leaning that way,gives me a better shot at it. That was one of the reasons we were so successful. Krishna uppuluri*: Pullela Gopichand,after his play days,became a very famous coach and he<U+0092>s nurtured so many young players. Will we see Leander Paes doing that after his playing days? Hundred per cent. It<U+0092>s already in the works. I<U+0092>ve already worked at it. And it<U+0092>s not only in this country,I<U+0092>ve looked at opening sports science centres at different places. My dad (Vece Paes,a hockey Olympian) had a tennis academy and he did really well. Dad has been looking after different sports for the last 40 years. In one context I<U+0092>m really blessed because I have my dad and mom a minute down the road from me. Dad<U+0092>s got amazing knowledge. I<U+0092>m saying this not just because I<U+0092>m his son,I<U+0092>m saying this as a professional athlete who<U+0092>s still winning grand slams and achieving at the highest echelons of the game at 40. He<U+0092>s got an amazing knowledge of sports medicine,fitness,diet,lifestyle,simplicity of thought,an amazing brain,and is a psychologist who mentors us athletes. So,one of the things I would love to do as a son is create a legacy for him. Mihir Vasavda: When we look at the Europeans,Australians and the Americans,their physique and power <U+0097> is it purely genetic or is it the way they train? I think there are two things working there. One,there is a lot of genetics involved. If we look,whether it<U+0092>s the north of India,if we look whether it<U+0092>s the Adivasi race,if we look at some of our modern athletes <U+0097> and I can name a few <U+0097> a lot of our modern athletes are coming from rural areasÖ To me the biggest example of that is M S Dhoni. If you look at his technique,it<U+0092>s not classic copy-book technique. But it<U+0092>s so powerful and so potent that in a World Cup tournament he can turn a match on its head. If you look at his personality,his confidence,you would not expect someone from a rural area to have that. But because of the ruggedness of Indian rural areas,of our smaller towns,they are tough and rugged not just in terms of genetics but also in terms of the mind,in terms of personality. He really is an example about how we can produce champions in this country <U+0097> not just from Mumbai,Calcutta,Delhi,Bangalore and Chennai,but also from rural areas. That<U+0092>s where our real talent lies. So is it genetic? Maybe a little bit. Shivani Naik: Do you have the patience to train a 12-year-old or a 14-year-old who is not as talented or as hardworking as you were? I didn<U+0092>t think I was talented already. So that wouldn<U+0092>t be an issue,I have a lot of patience. Shivani Naik: How do you deal with someone who does not bring that kind of commitment to the sport? If I can change it,if I can make it better,then I will spend time to make it better. If I feel I cannot change it,then I<U+0092>ll just keep peace. Some people call it choosing your battles,I call it recognising the person you<U+0092>re dealing with. Shivani Naik: We use words like <U+0091>revenge<U+0092> and <U+0091>grudge matches<U+0092> very often when we write. Do these things normally come through against any player? Not for me. I know that some athletes have it,I don<U+0092>t. For me a match is a match. I<U+0092>m going to beat you as hard as I can. Because if you<U+0092>re beating me,you<U+0092>re taking lunch money from Aiyanna (Paes<U+0092>s daughter). Doesn<U+0092>t matter if it<U+0092>s a grudge match or not. Shahid Judge: You mentioned that fitness is your passion. At 40,has it become harder for you to stay match fit compared to what it was when you were younger? The rehab has become harder,longer. I spend a lot more hours now than I had to as a kid. You know,as a kid I was very disciplined,and that discipline allowed me to be wild. I had to skip 10,000 skips everyday. Now,both my heel bones are broken. They<U+0092>ve cracked. There<U+0092>s an inch-and-a-half of calcification on each heel bone. When you put your foot down,when you wake up in the morning and if that feels like you<U+0092>ve got a knife in it every morning,you got to do rehab. So,the training now is a lot more about injury prevention. Bharat Sundaresan: Going back to the original question about you,Sachin Tendulkar and Viswanathan Anand having started so many years ago,is longevity something you can aspire for,especially if you start your professional sporting career so young,or is it something that you don<U+0092>t think about and it just happens? I actually thought I<U+0092>d retire at 27. I had a conversation with Jimmy Connors in 1991 when he did really well at the US Open. I asked him,<U+0091>Sir,how are you playing so well even now? I mean,what do you do in your daily life or your professional life to still preserve the body?<U+0092>. And what he told me then taught me a big lesson. He said,<U+0091>Every single match,I wear a brand new shoe<U+0092>. It means if he<U+0092>s playing 365 matches in a year,his sponsor gives him 365 different shoes. He also said that he wears double socks or socks that are very thick. And why he did that was because his generation was the first to transfer from national playing fields of clay court,grass court,to synthetic surfaces. Synthetic surfaces are really hard. So,for your knee joint,your ankle joint,your back <U+0097> the wear-and-tear is a lot more. So the longevity,what he was talking about,was in his equipment. I didn<U+0092>t think I would play beyond 27,but when you start learning tricks from Connors and Martina,you do well. Tabassum Barnagarwala: Everybody has a back-up option as a career. Did you have a second choice or option? I<U+0092>m actually a talented football player. I got a scholarship to one of the top football teams in the world when I was 12. Sometimes it<U+0092>s important in life not to only go with your strengths. Football comes naturally because I have Bengali and Portuguese blood,my mother is Bengali,dad<U+0092>s from Goa. As a child,I used to sleep with my football boots. Alaka Sahani: You have a life away from tennis. You have acted in films and,if I<U+0092>m not mistaken,you<U+0092>ve been in fashion shows. How often do these temptations of glamour come in your way,and how do you respond to them? I was offered my first movie in 1996 <U+0097> The Story of Lion Heart. My name Leander means the Lion Heart. It was a cliched kind of story <U+0097> rags to riches,young Indian boy growing up in an environment that does not have the infrastructure to nurture a champion,then found his way with family support to achieve excellence. At some point of time,I will write a book and make that into a movie. I<U+0092>ve been offered modelling,advertising commercials since I was nine or 10 years old. I shut it down a long time ago,around 15 years ago,because I felt that I was going to come into the movies. And I did. I released Rajdhani Express earlier this year. Alaka: Are we going to see you in more movies? If the right project comes around,I will do it. My creative juices are towards theatre or filmsÖ There<U+0092>s a big clash. We have conversations at home where I say that when I<U+0092>m done with tennis,I want to go and do this movie,and they all keep laughing. Because they know I<U+0092>m going to come back to tennis. When you<U+0092>re doing something you have to strive for excellence,you have to strive to be the best at it. Just finished a graphic-novel that is on the edit floor. It<U+0092>s more an under-cover spy agent kind of movie or book rather.",I have had 95 partners. I didnít choose all of them: Leander Paes | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/i-have-had-95-partners-i-didnt-choose-all-of-them-leander-paes/
937,"Related. At this Idea Exchange,Iranian Ambassador Gholamreza Ansari says Tehran achieved what it wanted to in the Geneva nuclear deal. Promising commitment to the pipeline project,the Ambassador adds that the only solution to terrorism is economic cooperation. The session was moderated by Assistant Editor Shubhajit Roy. Shubhajit Roy: On November 24,Iran signed a historic nuclear deal with six major world powers. What made Iran come to Geneva,and what is the future of the country? People are saying that Iran came to Geneva because of the sanctions and military threats. Let me go into the history of the issue and compare to 2003Ö Afghanistan had been attacked by the Americans. After Afghanistan,we were blamed. We received offers from Europeans saying they were ready for some settlement and we were told they would respect our rights according to the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty). In those days we just had 164 centrifuges and,sometimes,when we talked about yellowcake (uranium oxide),it was amazing for everybody that Iran was capable of it. It was very difficult for people to believe that. We respected the offers and came to some sort of negotiation. In the end we found that they are not respecting our rightsÖ Now there is a completely new situation in the region. We have had an Islamic awakening,the Arab Spring. The kings are very shaky. From the economic point of view,the oil price is the highest in history <U+0097> around 100 dollars a barrel. We have high revenues from oil and now,even if we are facing sanctions,everyone knows our capabilities in aerospace,biotechnology and computer scienceÖ We have more than 9,000 centrifuges now. If you go into what we have signed in Geneva,you will understand the capabilities of Iran. We have had very successful elections. More than 73 per cent of the population took part in the elections,which were peaceful and accepted by everybody,whether friends of Iran or against it. (Hassan) Rouhani came to office with a completely new approach <U+0097> constructive,cooperative,confidence-building measures <U+0097> and this new approach took us to Geneva. It was not because of the American sanctions and military threats but because,comparing 2003 to 2013,we are in a completely new situation. Everyone knows what is going on in Afghanistan,Iraq,Lebanon,Egypt,Africa and Syria,all these countries surrounding Iran and the Middle East. Everybody tells us that military threat is quite constant. Sanctions are difficult but they are not elements which can take us to Geneva or took us there. We are there for a new and constructive approach and we think we have achieved what we wanted to achieve. Iran is not for the atomic bomb. I have the verdict of Ayatollah Khamenei and it was strong support to show that Iran is not in favour of the atomic bomb. In our religious approach,atomic bomb is completely haram. We are looking for technology,scientific capabilities and are not looking for the atomic bomb. We think that atomic bomb is not for the benefit of anybody. We were in Geneva for a new approach. This is something we and the world neededÖ When you go to all the stock markets in the world,you get to see that it was celebrated by everybody. Because it is a need of the international community and a desperate need of the region as well. Terrorism is a real threat everywhere. It began in Afghanistan and has spread out to Syria,North Africa,some African countries,Central Asia. So it<U+0092>s the right time to get involved in a very important country such as Iran with capabilities of finding a solution to all this mess created by foreigners and to countries which will benefit from instabilityÖ We are looking for stability and cooperation. We think we will be the first country to benefit from this sort of solution for peace. According to our capabilities,natural resources,manpower,very exclusive geographical situation in a peaceful region,we will be the first country to benefit and we want to share our assets with other countries. For example,India. We have quite complimentary economic relations. India needs energy,Iran is producing energyÖ Secondly,Iran can be the best access for countries in Central Asia and Afghanistan. India is very interested in using this passage. So these are two big elements which link us together,and if we have not been able to use these,it<U+0092>s just because of pressures on Indians,and sanctions. So Iran after sanctions can have the full potential for cooperation with the regionÖ Iran can be a hub for energy and transportation. We can buy energy from this side and sell it to the other. We can be the hub for electricity for all neighbouring regions. So this is the projection for future which we are desperately looking for. We are looking for cooperation and institutionalising links through pipelines,railroads,roads and electricity links. This region contains 40 per cent of the natural resources of the world but just 10 per cent of its GDP. This is the root for instability. We should all help each other towards a better economy,which can be a very good base for security arrangements. The countries which think they can prevail in the region and create hegemonies, are ignorant. Rakesh Sinha: Why is Israel calling this accord a historic mistake? Historic mistake for them,yes. Because Israel <U+0097> we call them a Zionist regime <U+0097> relies on and needs American support and is very afraid of losing it. Americans have lost their reputation in the Middle East,Americans are blamed for what they have done in the Middle EastÖ This is a costly price the Americans are paying for their approach in the Middle East. Dilip Bobb: This deal has been there for six months now. Is there scope for a permanent deal? I don<U+0092>t think so. When we came together,it was the most natural time. It was not because of the Iranian need and it was not just because of the American need. Both sides need to have a better region. The region is fed up with extremism and terrorism. Today is Syria<U+0092>s turn but nobody knows whose turn will be next. This is the main difficulty for the region and it can be addressed only when governments come together and take decisive measures like eradicating poverty,trying to develop the region economically. And this can be done just through cooperationÖ We are definitely committed to what we have signed for,but if they reject,that<U+0092>s their problem. It can be a big mistake. Muzamil Jaleel: The other country unhappy about the accord is Saudi Arabia. Is there a competition for influence between Iran and Saudi Arabia? Everybody has got a good lesson in Syria. They wanted to solve the Syrian issue in weeks,but it is more than 32 months nowÖ Europeans who were supporting the opposition in Syria now understand the only solution should be political. This was what we were saying from the first day. All the difficulties in the region should be solved through negotiation and political ways. Definitely Saudi Arabia is a substantial country in the region. I think it is a misunderstanding that problems can be solved through military means. We must come together,sit and discuss and find solutions towards economic development. The history of the Islamic Republic (of Iran) shows that we are men of cooperation. We knew who was paying expenses to Saddam Hussein,and for the war against Iran. When Kuwait was attacked by Hussein,Iran was the first country to condemn the situation,and supported the resistance in KuwaitÖCompared to Saudi Arabia,where people were fleeing. But revenge is not a solutionÖ We hope in the future,we and the Saudi Arabians come together. Muzamil Jaleel: There is also talk that with Iran<U+0092>s influence increasing,it might create a Shia-Sunni divide again. We are pro-democracy not in Bahrain but in Syria as well. We said in Syria,in the beginning,that it<U+0092>s not American responsibility to say who should rule Syria. It is the people of Syria who are eligible to say who should rule them. The solution to the regime is democracy. Muslims,Christians,Jews <U+0097> one man,one vote. Anybody that comes out of these ballots,that<U+0092>s the regime that can rule. The people of the enemy nation don<U+0092>t have the right to intervene in other<U+0092>s affairs. But everybody took interest in Syria<U+0092>s affairs. The only country which will benefit from this is the Zionist regime. And the people who make the miscalculation. of supporting terrorism and who think they will benefit,they will lose. One day this cancer,terrorism,will go to their own homesÖ I<U+0092>m not saying there are no differences between Shias and Sunnis,there are disputes all over. Solving problems should not be through coercive action. Solving problems means through dialogue,and sitting,discussing,through political means. Amitav Ranjan: What is the status of the Iranian economy? We are not in a prosperous situation economically. (But) you cannot find a single regime where the system has been toppled because of sanctions,and we hope these pressures will be removed. But if aggression happens,if they refuse to fulfil their promises,I assure you,we have been able to live over 30 years in this world,we are a wealthy country. And anybody who has wealth has ways to solve their own problems. And don<U+0092>t forget,when we are talking about economic difficulties,it<U+0092>s not mainly because of the sanctions. It<U+0092>s because of the economic structure. We have been relying on oil. Maybe these sanctions give this sign to us,that we must correct this. Manu Pubby: What will be the impact of this deal on the pullout of American troops from Afghanistan? And on your relationship with Pakistan? In Afghanistan,we are facing a new approach,which is irreversible. Even ordinary people are thinking of a better life,better education. Iran and India can play a very crucial role to push this approach,especially on the economic front. It<U+0092>s very dependent on what is going on in the Middle East. If the extremists gain power in Syria,the situation would deteriorate for Afghanistan,Central Asia,even the Middle East. Now thank god that all Europeans are sending their <U+0091>militants<U+0092> to Syria and on the other hand giving information to the government that these people are there. They want to finish everything there,because if these people get back to their home countries,nobody will know what will happen. So they are prolonging the situation this wayÖ A dead militant is better than a live one. So a good victory in Syria and a good victory against extremism in the region will show us a better future in Afghanistan. After such deals,everyone is going to work with a very constructive approachÖ There is room for India and Iran to cooperate on Afghanistan. We are offering Indians better access to Afghanistan through Chabahar,we are trying to facilitate goods to Afghanistan. In Pakistan<U+0092>s case,well everyone knows we can<U+0092>t take Pakistan and put it in South America. So we should all think about how we can help Pakistan,how we can help their government for better governance. So we offer help. Let me tell you a secret. In the beginning of this pipeline,from the Iranian point of view,the approach was that all destinations should be through Europe,for better money,economic influence and new technologies. If we offered this pipeline to Pakistan and India,it was not because of an economic purpose. It was for linking these three countries for their interests <U+0097>we know of their desperate need for energy. We are still for that. But we need a more powerful approach from PakistanÖ They are falling in love with some countries,we are waiting to see what happens to this love. Let<U+0092>s not jump into the Iran-America relationship,which is very,very complicated. They have humiliated our nation <U+0097> it<U+0092>s a real thing. They should change their approach,it<U+0092>s a must. It<U+0092>s not about giving greetings during Ramzan or other nonsense. Rakesh Sinha: So do you have to explain the accord to your own people,now that you<U+0092>re shaking hands with Satan? The world is changing,maybe the Satans are changing as well. They should behave and maybe there will be a new phenomenon. Vijaita Singh: In 2012,there was an attack on an Israeli diplomat here in Delhi,and India asked Iran for some information as the accused allegedly belonged to Iran. Any development on that front? There have been some papers and information exchanged between the two countries,but let<U+0092>s put that aside. There was no logic behind that attempt to come from Iran. We used to have very good relations with the Indians and we didn<U+0092>t need to deteriorate them. If you go to your own newspaper articles from that time,you will see very artificial things in that. You see,when you go to the Zionist people,they link everything to each otherÖ We have been a real country for thousands of years and it<U+0092>s very different between a nation with a history and an artificial city-state which brought people from all over the world,whether white Jews,black Jews,yellow Jews,saying that this is a country. It<U+0092>s nonsenseÖ. Personally,I think,you will find Israelis behind this (attack). Sharon Thambala*: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated that Israel should be wiped off the face of the Earth. Our stand on the Zionist regime has been the same for many years. We think the only solution to the Zionist regime is through democracy. One nation,combined of Jews,Christians and Muslims,each person with one vote. We believe if they go through such a channel,as South Africa or Russia,you will see a new regime coming up,which we definitely respect. And they can represent themselves in the region without having to fight anybody. At least it will be coming through something real,not bringing some people and saying this is a country based on race. In the 21st century,it<U+0092>s a shame to create a country on race. We<U+0092>re threatened all the time. Everybody is taking military action off the table and they<U+0092>re still putting it back on. Their only solution is <U+0091>attack Iran<U+0092>. When they wanted to attack Iraq or attacked Syria or Sudan,they didn<U+0092>t announce it in advance. Why is it Iran all the time you<U+0092>re attacking? Because they can<U+0092>t,and they don<U+0092>t want to. If they could,they would,but they can<U+0092>t. Rakesh Sinha: What about the scientists who were targeted? Yes,they were targeted and killed. But we have thousands of scientists. You can kill one,five,10,15,50,but you can<U+0092>t kill thousands. So the way we are protecting ourselves is mass production of everything,whether it<U+0092>s scientists or centrifuges. Kaunain Sheriff *: How does Iran perceive the rising prominence of China in the region? Our relations with the Chinese are quite good. Even during the period of sanctions,they were very smart and didn<U+0092>t listen to the Americans. They established very good economic relations,especially in investments. Ambreen Khan: What is your take on Narendra Modi versus the Congress? This is not our business <U+0097> we can just enjoy and we are enjoying. Anybody who comes up,we believe will want better relations with Iran. This is something we see in all parties,governments. Our leadership will concentrate on having good relations with India.","ëSanctions or threats canít take us to Geneva. We were there for a new approach.

938,"Summary. Related. An early member of anti-GM movement,Mark Lynas made a turnaround early this year. Speaking to The Indian Express Editor-in-Chief Shekhar Gupta,on NDTV 24X7,Lynas says science won him over,explains how GM myths take root,and flays activists for denying farmers the right to make choices. You used to sneak into people<U+0092>s farms and burn crops because they used genetically modified technology. And then suddenly,sometime early this year,you made a complete turnaround. An environmental activist in some ways,the founder of the anti-GM movementÖ Not the founder,I was one of the early members. But this was a very broad,diverse coalition which involved Prince Charles,the right-wing press,the middle-class people. I look back and I think,<U+0091>What went wrong?<U+0092>. How come we all came to believe something which was not just incorrect but the precise opposite of the truth the scientists were telling us? It took me 10 years to really understand that the science wasn<U+0092>t supporting what we as activists were saying. And that was a very long process,a difficult process. I think it has cost me,if not credibility,a lot of grey hair. You are a brave man. I am (taking on ideology) in some ways because the environmental movement has an ideological opposition to genetically modified crops. It is not based on science,it is not based on any rational assessment of risks and benefits. It is something about the fear of new technology,the fear of the <U+0091>new<U+0092>. And when these fears become widely believed,people believe all sorts of myths about GM being poisonous,about causing sterility. And the scientists cannot understand why these myths have become so pervasive. They are now worldwide. Describe this ideology and compare this with religious ideology,as you see it. There is big suspicion that there is something about GM technology that is going to bring multinationals to enslave farmers. The other is that there is something inherently dangerous about GM. Because it is a powerful technology. We can see scientists moving genes from plants into animals because,of course,all living things share the same genetic system of DNA. But this ideology is not limited to GM. Like all religious ideologies have multiple demons,so does this. Yes,the ideology is to some extent anti-progressive and anti-development. The insistence is that farmers,in developing countries in particular,should not have access to new technology,to new crops which are more productive. There is also an opposition to hybrid crops,to mechanisation. The pesticidesÖ The pesticides,true. One of the things I like about GM is that it enables us to reduce the use of pesticides. Is there sufficient evidence that GM reduces the use of pesticides? Bt cottonÖ The whole point of Bt cotton is that it has a genetic structure which enables it to target the pest itself. So,when the pest goes into the cotton plant,only the pest dies. If you are spraying it,you can imagine,all the insects die. That affects the birds,it affects biodiversity more widely. What was the scientific evidence on which you based your opposition to GM food? I did not base my opposition on scientific evidence,that is the point. And so it was when I started writing scientific books that I realised there was a conflict between my pro-science position on climate change and my anti-science position on biotechnology. I then had to change my mind to become pro-science across the whole board. Because I was getting my information from activist groups,like most people do,like the media does. Activist groups were telling me that there was something evilÖ On these issues,let me tell you,media around the world does not want to be confused with factsÖ So were you misled? Were you lazy? I think I was ignorant,misinformed,I will put it that way. I never knowingly made a statement I knew was incorrect. I wouldn<U+0092>t say I am a liar because I didn<U+0092>t say something I knew to be untrue. What I was doing was repeating the myths which had already been stated numerous times by Greenpeace and other organisations. Because I was an environmentalist. How many environmentalists can you get to walk down this path and tell you a scientific perspective on GMOs (genetically modified organisms)? Almost none. This is a major failing of the environmental movement which has done so much. good in terms of deforestation,over-fishing,biodiversityÖ And climate changeÖ Where you are still pro-science. I am like that (clasping hands) with Greenpeace on climate change. That is why I cannot understand why they have a pro-science position on climate change and an anti-science position on biotechnology,where a vast majority of scientists would say they are talking rubbish. When you made this turnaround,one of our most prominent and respected activists,Vandana Shiva,said you speaking thus was like giving rapists the freedom to rape. I cannot see why you describe Vandana Shiva as either prominent or respected. I mean she does knowingly make statements which are clearly inaccurate and incorrect about farmer suicides and other assertions about Monsanto,BT cottonÖ I mean not just wrong,I would say those were liesÖ To compare GMOs with that (rape) was obscene,offensive and a betrayal of humanitarian and moral values. But Shiva is well meaning. Why is she doing it? She is not an enemy of India or Indian farmers. I think she is. Her insistence on only the traditional on how farmers should live denies the ability of children in rural areas to ever improve themselves,to be rocket scientists,or whatever. How is it that somebody who never gets proper education because they only have traditional cultures and values <U+0097> they can never even leave the village <U+0097> get to change the world? ÖI am no expert but some of the Indian farmers I have spoken to have said we want the choice to grow new technologies. She and the activists are just trying to ban all of these new crops. That is a denial of choice. I would not even say I am pro-GM; I am pro-choice. Farmers should have the choice to benefit from modern science,just like everyone else. Some people say you took a lot of money from <U+0091>evil<U+0092> MNCs. That is not true. Why should I trust you now,if you now say that everything you told me all these years was nonsense? Would you trust somebody who can change his mind according to changing evidence,or would you trust somebody who holds on to the same position no matter what the evidence says? John Maynard Keynes said this: <U+0091>When facts change,I change my mind. What do you do sir?<U+0092>. That is the problem we have. The people who project themselves as leaders have to create an image of infallibility,and so they can never admit to doing wrong. They can never admit to doing a U-turn. But actually,a U-turn makes sense if you assess the science and you find your policy is wrong. You talked about the ideology and science of climate change and GM,and you said the opposition to GM is a mix of Leftist and anti-corporate ideologies. Where does the campaign on climate change come in? A lot of that is also anti-corporate and that is also Left. The environmental movement so quickly accepted the science on climate change because it appeared to conform to pre-existing ideological positions,which were anti-big business,anti-fossil fuel companies,and actually the fossil fuel companies are causing the climate change. But on biotechnology,the anti-corporate agenda didn<U+0092>t fit the science because the science says genetic modification is safe,and can be used to benefit the environment. And then you have a funny situation where the ideologies of the Left oppose GM food but the ideologies of the Right deny climate change. Unfortunately in these things there are clear political boundariesÖ It is the ideology which defines the scientific perspective. Are you trying to persuade anybody in India? I am here with the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative,which is a meeting of scientists from across the world looking at a problem of wheat rust,which is potentially a huge threatÖ UT-99 can affect all the varieties which have been yielding such good returns for the last several decades. Scientists have identified the genes which can protect and can give rust resistance. But unless you can use GM technology to get them into wheat,we cannot use this. Are you meeting anyone in the government? The Agriculture Minister. I am not meeting Jairam Ramesh,whom I have crossed swords with. I thought his moratorium on BT brinjal was a betrayal of scientific values and a failure of personal leadership. Why do you say so? Because he was given a choice between superstitions on one side and scientific evidence on the other. He chose superstitions because it was the populist thing to do. And,obviously,he is the kind of politician who only thinks about the next election. But politics is about leadership. You have to assess the evidence,you have to form a judgment about what is right and then lead people on that basis. Ramesh was just behind everybody,trying to take a safe space. I will put in one disclaimer on his behalf: he has never fought an election and is unlikely to fight one. But he did quote a bunch of experts or scientists. These are scientists who would have been brought to the fore by activists. I could name at least five scientists who do not believe in climate change. Would that mean there is a 50:50 debate on this issue? No,it means that 97,98 per cent of scientists say that climate change is real and only a tiny percentage says it is not. It is the same with biotechnology. You can find one or two scientists but most of them have activist backgrounds and do not actually have the credentials of being scientifically active. When you made your turnaround,Ramesh told The Indian Express that he did not take you seriously in any case. Which is fine. But I do not think he takes science seriously,which is much worseÖ He has a mandate as an environment minister to do what is best for environment. It is clear that GM crops can actually reduce pesticide useÖ Had BT brinjal been commercialised,there would have been less pesticide residue in the brinjal product. Do you believe it would make all the native varieties of brinjal extinct? I can<U+0092>t see why that is even logical. Why should that happen? What is going to make them go extinct? Maybe because BT brinjal will be so profitable,they will stop growing any other variety. So Ramesh is saying you cannot use a technology that works because those that do not will disappear. How useful is that? Why are you so sceptical of organic agriculture? Because I think biotechnology is the only system that can make organic agriculture work. We can have crops that protect themselves through their own genetics and biology. So when a pest attacks,the crop can kill the pest. At the moment,as an organic farmer <U+0097> my father is one <U+0097> you basically plant your crop and you pray,because if the pests come,you either squeeze them with your fingers or there is nothing you can do. Insisting that when there is a food supply crisis,we should all go organic is not just absurd,it is also morally reprehensible because we need more food,from lesser land. But there are arguments. They will take you to certain specific farms and show you organic farming led to rising yields. These are very,very high labour. So literally,if you have one person for one square metre,you can get a very high yield on a mixed farming system. But that is not how we feed billions of people in mega-cities,on mechanised farming,which need tractors over large areas. You have used really rude descriptions for organic food. The problem is with the conceptual level of organic. It is based on,what I call,naturalistic fallacy <U+0097> so everything natural is good and everything artificial is badÖ In fact,there was a disease outbreak of E.coli in organic bean sprouts in Germany in 2011,which killed 50 people. Now imagine if a GMO crop had killed 50 people. The media would have gone crazy. This almost made no headlines. Much of the GM opposition is actually coming from Europe. I suspect a lot of the soyabean soil we import from the US is GM,but nobody tells us. Yes it is Europe more than the US. But if you look at the funding source of many of the activist groups,they claim to be representing the farmers or Indian perspectives or African perspectives. All their money comes from Switzerland,from the UK,and from Germany. And so I question,whose ideological perspectives are being represented by these activists who say that they are supporting nationalist agendas but are actually supporting organic agendas or traditionalist agendas based on romantic misconceptions held in Europe,rather than the countries themselves. And why is Europe so romantic? Because we have a post-colonial guilt syndrome. So we are just protecting the <U+0091>traditional<U+0092>,protecting <U+0091>traditional values<U+0092> and so on. That way we will shovel money about. As the former colonisers of this country,that makes us feel less guilty. And you say again that there is no scientific evidence that GM technology causes harm. Not even so much as a headache or stomach ache. There has never been a substantiated case of any impact on human health. And the other bugbear of activists,nuclear energy? I notice you are taking on many demons at the same time. Nuclear power is the safest form of power generation developed. I say this and people look at me like <U+0091>you are crazy<U+0092>. But that is the realityÖ We cannot solve climate change without nuclear energy. But when such a pro-science country like Germany bans nuclear energy,how do you persuade us Indians? Germany has a strange position on this. I think it goes back to the war. They somehow identify nuclear with Adolf HitlerÖ But that does not apply to the rest of the world. India now has the choice between large-scale use of coal and large-scale use of nuclear. If it goes for coal,then the Maldives will sink and the rest of the climate is going to be pretty screwed worldwide. One can agree with you or disagree with you,but the essence of science is questioning an argument. The essence of ideology is the opposite. I would never say all GM crops will always be safe. If you can show conclusively that a certain crop poses health dangers,then absolutely we should not use itÖ It does not make sense to ban an entire technology on the basis of some purported risk and some unspecified data in the future.","ëThe opposition to GM crops is not based on scienceÖ There is no substantiated case of a health impact,even so much as a headacheí | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/the-opposition-to-gm-crops-is-not-based-on-science-there-is-no-substantiated-case-of-a-health-impact-even-so-much-as-a-headache-2/

Related. In this Walk the Talk on NDTV 24X7,renowned psephologist Sir David Butler talks to The Indian Express Editor-in-Chief Shekhar Gupta about how he coined the words swing and psephology,the reason he remains optimistic about India after studying its elections for so long,and why bad opinion polls get driven out on own. At a time when politicians are debating whether pre-election opinion polls are a good idea or an evil that distorts our elections,we are lucky to be talking to the guru of gurus when it comes to opinion polling,Sir David Butler. You explained to the world what a swing means. Yes I suppose I have two words that I have been responsible for <U+0097> I didn<U+0092>t invent either of them. The first is swing. People talked about the swing of the pendulum between one election and next. They said it in the past,but they hadn<U+0092>t made it systematic. When I was a very young man,I wrote an article which talked about swing and it caught on. It became absolutely central to the interpretation of elections,particularly when you had two dominant parties. So that<U+0092>s one word. The other word I am responsible for is psephology. Now,it was an Oxford joke. Somebody said they are making a habit of the systematic study of elections. So we should have a word for it. And a classical scholar said,well,the Greeks voted by dropping pebbles in urns. Psephos is the Greek for pebble. And so we made a joke of it,psepho-itry,psepho-analysis and other things,while working on elections in the early 1950s,and it just caught onÖ I<U+0092>m rather embarrassed,I don<U+0092>t think of it as science,but quite a lot of gimmicks. Studying elections is not a science at all,it<U+0092>s rather pompous. I rather regret having put it into currency. But you have made a science out of it,for you have explained British elections to British viewers for 60 years now. Yes,I was very lucky. They put on a programme,the first time a British election results programme,in 1950,and I was asked to take part in it. I had hardly ever been in front of the camera. But people were interested in somebody who could make,in reasonable,simple terms,sense of quite complicated statisticsÖ For 30 years I did the basic quantitative analysis of what was happening in the country as the results came in over a 24-hour periodÖ I travelled the world,I went to Australia and came to India. Prannoy Roy invited me to come and talk about the study of elections in 1983,and then invited me to come back in 1984,before the electionÖ And I worked as a backroom boy for 20 years with Prannoy and his colleagues and others in NDTV,helping on election nights. The three of you developed the index of opposition unity <U+0097> you,Prannoy Roy and Ashok Lahiri. Can you explain this index. Well,that was a simple way to deal with a situation when you had many parties. The Congress was the dominant partyÖ had been for long,still is. I had come from a world where swing was quite simple because we had had for 30-40 years,Conservatives or Labour <U+0097> other parties didn<U+0092>t really matter. In India,it was always other parties that mattered. So you made the Congress the basis,and then you assumed that the others were against the Congress and you had some measure of how that worked out. But Narendra Modi<U+0092>s rise has divided the Opposition. You should now be talking of an index of opposition disunity!Ö There is also a big controversy this time because many politicians are attacking the opinion poll industry. It is being called evil,induced by bribery,non-science. Well,people have always been sceptical about it. Some polls can be attacked,they can be done dishonestly,but there is no substitute. People in old times would say let<U+0092>s go out and get the pulse of the nation. But it was dubious,much more dubious than people trying to go about it systematically. Banning of polls,I think,is a misguided idea. Then you would get leaks,secret private polls,and they may be much more misleading than polls,if you have public polls. In Britain,we have five significant polling companies and they actually are an association,which guarantees that they can be inspected,their sample size,their method of work can be explained. I don<U+0092>t think in Britain really anybody suggests banning polls. Some countries have banned them,like in Australia they are banned for the last three days (before elections). But by that time,things are settled. I think it is more or less impossible to prevent people talking to other people about what happens. If you want to call it a poll,you must do it systematically. It obviously can be manipulated,but if there is enough publicity,good polls drive out bad polls. And in Britain,they reveal their data. So effectively it is about submitting your data for peer review. Yes. It is not that British pollsters haven<U+0092>t been wrong. In 1992,all the major polls grossly estimated Labour strengthÖ But there was not a suggestion of corruption. Other countries tried to ban polls,but it just doesn<U+0092>t work. You get the stories,by <U+0091>secret polls<U+0092>,<U+0091>sources<U+0092>Ö. In India we say <U+0091>Intelligence Bureau polls<U+0092>. So pollsters going out is much better than spooks going outÖ I just know that in western democracies,banning (opinion) polls is,one,offensive in terms of civil liberties and,two,probably ineffective because people would do secret polls or say they have done secret polls that are not public ones and open to scrutiny. When politicians attacks pollsters,TV channels in India,how do you feel? I don<U+0092>t like itÖ In a free society,people can say what they like,but the test must be openness and how well the polls actually do. And if polls come unstuck badly,it will teach people to be sceptical about polls in the future. And if these polls come out well,they will be more respectedÖ Take the poll that has the largest sample or has a better track record in recent times. Can you recount the story of your meeting with Winston Churchill?Ö It was a very drunken Churchill you met. In 1950,I had written an article in The Economist about the election and how one might judge it. Suddenly I was summoned by Winston Churchill,whom I had no contact with. And I had this extraordinary experience as a 25-year-old of spending four hours alone with him 10 days before the elections. He had no business wasting his time on a totally unimportant young man but he talked and he kept on forgetting why he had invited me and kept reminiscing. At one moment Anthony Eden,his deputy,made a broadcast and he said,<U+0091>What did you think of that?<U+0092>. I said it might have been a good speech at the Oxford Union but it was not a good broadcast for the great British public. He said <U+0091>Ah,he was not talking down to British people<U+0092>. <U+0091>I could do it<U+0092>,he said. He then imitated a union leader talking down to the people,and then said,<U+0091>I<U+0092>ve never talked down to the British people<U+0092>. He went back to his career and said,<U+0091>Why,in the dark days of 1940,when Britain stood alone,I did not mince my words. I told the people how it was<U+0092>. Then he gave me the blood,toil,sweat and tears speech of June 1940. And I said,<U+0091>Well in 1940 I was only 15 and it never occurred to me that Britain could be defeated<U+0092>. He said,<U+0091>What? Only 15 in 1940!<U+0092>. And he counted on his fingers,<U+0091>Why,you must be only 25 now! Better hurry up young man,Napoleon was only 25 when he crossed the bridge of Lodi<U+0092>Ö I have never been able to be terribly in awe of anyone since I was in the presence of a man I regarded <U+0097> not because I supported his politics <U+0097> but he was the greatest man in the world in his own way,suddenly giving me this romantic view of the whole panoply of history. We seem to have an interesting leader rise in India now,Modi,very interesting,very polarising. And I would say something that Arun Jaitley,the leader of the Opposition in our Upper House,said <U+0097> that Modi<U+0092>s rise is about chemistry,not arithmetic. And what<U+0092>s happening across India will prove arithmetic,pollsters wrong. I am sceptical about that. But what struck me during this visit to the country is how the reputation of Manmohan Singh seems to have gone down <U+0097> I knew him when he was a student of Oxford. And the reputation of Modi seems to have recovered from what was a very bad reputation 10 years ago. In 2014,it will be 30 years since any party won a majority in India. In a society or polity as divided,what would it take for any party to win a majority? I don<U+0092>t know that there is any answer to that. A grave national crisis can bring people along. Well,there was a majority in 1984,there was also a huge swing back between 1989 and 1991,after Rajiv<U+0092>s death. So you can get a big emotional swing in a short space of time to some unforeseen event. But I don<U+0092>t think that is very likely. The central question in Indian politics today <U+0097> and I will put it in what you may call simplistic terms <U+0097> is that this contest is between two groups. One believes that religion and nationalism can unite what caste divides. The other believes that socialism can unite whom caste divides. Which one do you think has a better chance? What does history tell us? If I give an academic hedge,a bit of both. I mean nationalism,socialism,care for people,the generality of people,it can be a very valuable force against crude individualism. On the other hand it does seem that a good deal of individualism goes down well in the markets,like enterprising people doing it their own way and trying to avoid too much government regulation. I am just a middle-of-the-world kind of person who believes compromise works and who,on the whole,believes that over time things get better. Studying Indian politics for so many years,what has fascinated you the most about it? The most moving moment I<U+0092>ve had in India was in 1984 when I had just flown in and Prannoy Roy took me to a small women<U+0092>s group,with a girl who had just joined his staff. We were looking at the poll she had done. The poll was very primitive and she had brought in cyclostyled sheets of paper. One of the questions was,<U+0091>What is the most important issue for you in this election?<U+0092>. <U+0091>Unity of India<U+0092> was one of the five choices. And over 50 per cent were choosing unity of IndiaÖ in Indian villages all around the country. That moved me and made me an optimist about India. All sorts of traumas came up in the last 30 years,but India stays united. And you will likely get as good a result from a poll now as you did then,just after the death of Mrs Gandhi. In fact,as our politics has got more divided,India has got more unitedÖ On the decline of the Gandhis as a national powerÖ The basic thing is India was united,relatively speaking,by the Congress. Pandit Nehru was the head of the Congress and symbolises the legacy of the Independence movement. It just dies away over 50 yearsÖ What Nehru did nobody can do again. Nobody could emerge into that socially dominant position. Or what Indira did,for that matter. There she was. She had her name and her reputation and she could pass it on to Rajiv,and I suppose there is still some legacy of it. But I believe it must be a terrible burden,the inheritance of the awful deaths and the brutalities against them. Do you reflect on the loss of control or power of Dr Manmohan Singh,whom you knew as a student? I don<U+0092>t know enough about what is going on. I know him to be a good man and an honest man. And one hears a lot about an awful lot who are not honest in Indian politics. What he has done or failed to do in a very difficult task,I don<U+0092>t know. He has the incredible achievement of actually surviving for 10 years. Nobody except the Gandhis has had 10 years in office. Even more remarkable is how you stay so fit and so interested. I see your eyes light up when you confront a complexity of politics. I still get excited by politics. I still get excited by elections in almost any country of the world. I am an old man now,I spend a lot of time just watching television and following particular individual election storiesÖ Next May,or whenever the results come in,I don<U+0092>t think I will be able to come out here,but I will certainly be glued to the television. What<U+0092>s got you going is just this curiosity,because it<U+0092>s easy to dismiss you as an election junkieÖ Elections are fun. Opinion polls are also a part of that fun,isn<U+0092>t it? Little bit entertainment,little bit knowledge. And you don<U+0092>t believe they influence voters<U+0092> minds or corrupt the election process. I have never seen any evidence. They never know whether it<U+0092>s an underdog effect or a bandwagon effect. Both the theses are possible,but nobody has produced any solid evidence. I have seen lots of articles,but I just don<U+0092>t believe this. They can,in some electoral systems,serve a purpose saying,<U+0091>This party has no hope,so don<U+0092>t waste your vote there<U+0092>. It will simplify elections. I won<U+0092>t say they have no influence,but I really do not think there is any solid evidence that there is a bandwagon <U+0097> <U+0091>let<U+0092>s go with the winner<U+0092> <U+0097> or an underdog effect <U+0097> <U+0091>that the winner is winning too big<U+0092>.",ëIíve never seen evidence of opinion polls influencing votersÖ making people go with the winner or deciding to back the underdogí | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/ive-never-seen-evidence-of-opinion-polls-influencing-voters-making-people-go-with-the-winner-or-deciding-to-back-the-underdog/
940,"Related. Exotic flowers such as gerbera, carnation and lilium, so far imported, are now being grown in Punjab under a poly house farming scheme of the National Horticulture Mission, which grants 50 per cent subsidy on the cost of planting and setting up the poly houses. Around the world, carnations and liliums are in demand for the preparation of bouquets, while gerbera is popular in decoration. Punjabís tradition has been marigolds, sunflowers and gladioses. Now farmers have tried an Indo-Israel technique in poly house farming and the experiment has clicked with the non-traditional varieties despite the odds ó extreme weather and hardly any financial support from the government. Himachal Pradesh and Haryana gives comparatively large subsidies over and above the 50 per cent subsidy under NHM. The NHM scheme has been available for four or five years in the state but few took to it initially because of a high initial cost. Until three years ago, Punjab had just a couple of floriculture poly houses; now, nearly 25 poly houses have come up, most of them in 2013. Another 20 poly houses are under construction. Under the scheme, two types of poly houses about three to four metres high are being set up in Punjab. Called ìnaturally ventilatedî and ìhi-tech poly house employing sand-and-pad systemî, these seek to maintain the temperature between 25 and 30∞C, which is ideal for full bloom. Most of Punjabís poly houses are of the ìnaturally ventilatedî kind. The flower beds, made as long as desired, are separated by pathways 1 to 1.5 feet wide for easy movement and drainage. ìThe construction and plantation cost for a 1,000 sq m, naturally ventilated poly house is around Rs 9.35 lakh while the cost for a hi-tech one the same size is Rs 14.65 lakh. NHM provides 50 per cent subsidy on both types of poly houses,î says horticulture director Dr Lajwinder Singh Brar. ìApart from this, growers have to spend on labour, pesticides, fungicides themselves.î A 2,000 sq m unit can fetch a net income of Rs 4-5 lakh, which translates into Rs 8-12 lakh per acre per year, while a farmer barely makes Rs 50,000 per acre in wheat or paddy cultivation. ìFloriculture units save on groundwater as drip irrigation is used here, increase the productivity of land and also fulfil the governmentís objective of encouraging diversification,î says Dr Lajwinder. The flowers can be planted round the year but in Punjab this is done mostly during September-October. Gerbera and carnations are three-year crops. The first. flowers come three months after plantation and these are high-cash crops, says horticulture development officer Dr Lal Bahadur. ìFarmers can recover their entire investment within two years if they are able to get a good market.î ìItís a wonderful business and I extended it from one acre to three, opening three poly houses one acre each, in the past two years,î says Rahul Gupta. ìBut in Punjab, the cost is high compared to costs in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The returns on investment in the first season are 50 to 55 per cent there, against 30 to 40 per cent in Punjab. Apart from NHM subsidies, those state governments too provide subsidies.î Kulwaran Singh Atwal, vice president of the Punjab Poly House Ownersí Association, has a 1.25-acre (4,500 sq m) polyhouse in which he started growing gerberas one-and-a-half years ago. Winner of the ìinnovative in diversified farmingî award from Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana, he also grew liliums and carnations but found these needed power supply round the clock to maintain the right temperatures amid Punjabís extremes. ìGerberas can be grown in a naturally ventilated poly house throughout the year, though production is low in extreme winter,î says Atwal. ìFor carnations and liliums, we need hi-tech poly houses where the temperature is maintained by running foggers every half-hour during extreme summers. That is possible only if we get power round the clock.î Manjit Singh, who has started gerbera cultivation and whose family owns four poly houses on 8,000 sq m, says he cultivated even carnations for two years by setting up a hi-tech unit on a half-acre plot in Jugral village in Jalandhar. He says they need government support in marketing as well as re-plantation after every three years, not just a one-time subsidy, pointing out that plantation of gerberas on 1,000 sq m costs Rs 1.5 to 2 lakh. Atwal says the market for these imported varieties is good in Punjab but only during the wedding season; otherwise the major market is Delhi. Apart from poly house floriculture, Punjab has 2,060 hectares currently under commercial floriculture and these produce 10,055 tonnes fresh and cut flowers. Like Gupta, Atwal stresses the need for state subsidy. ìWe are getting 50 per cent subsidy from NHM but to be in competition we need subsidy from the Punjab government too,î Atwal says. ìHaryana provides 15 per cent and Himachal Pradesh 90 per cent. Haryana even gives subsidy for drip irrigation. Punjab farmers are investing 50 per cent while those in Haryana and Himachal are investing just 35 and 10 per cent for growing same varieties. They can afford to charge less than Punjab farmers do in markets such as DelhiÖ Even Bihar is giving 90 per cent subsidy.î Gupta suggests the government open tissue culture labs to provide bulbs to farmers who are now getting these from Bangalore and Pune at high rates. Though a poly house survives many years, the net and the poly shee. ts need to be replaced after some years and the government should provide subsidy on that too, farmers say.","Exotic blossoms, now homemade | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/exotic-blossoms-now-homemade/
941,"Summary. Related. Madhya Pradesh, which has scripted a success story in agriculture, is likely to continue its strides in the current rabi season and has set its eyes on overtaking Punjab, the traditional major, in wheat production. The state was always known for producing quality wheat such as sharbati rather than quantity, but in recent years the government and farmers have focused also on volumes of other wheat varieties and ensured that MP is now spoken of in the same breath as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. ìWheat production this year is expected to be in the vicinity of 190 lakh tonnes which, if achieved, will surpass Punjabís production which has stagnated around 172 tonnes,íí says principal secretary (agriculture) Rajesh Rajora. UP will still maintain its top position in production, with the estimates about 300 lakh tonnes. Though sowing of some varieties is still being done, the agriculture department estimates the acreage will go up to 62,000 hectares from last seasonís 57,000 hectares. Increased irrigation facilities and populist decisions of the state government, such as giving a bonus over and above the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the central government, have attracted more and more farmers to wheat. Rajora says compared to Punjab, where 99 per cent of the crop is irrigated, MP still has some distance to cover because, despite the recent increase in facilities, not more than 84 per cent is irrigated. MP also has low productivity (yield per hectare) compared to Punjab and Haryanaís. According to Energy Minister Rajendra Shukla, feeder separation helped the government meet farmersí demand for electricity, a factor that will contribute to more production. This year, wheat production is likely to be 30 lakh tonnes more than last seasonís. But not all the wheat produced in MP is sold to the government because premium varieties such as sharbati and durum are purchased at market rates. Sharbati production accounts for nearly 15 lakh tonnes while durum production ranges between 5 and 8 lakh tonnes. Also, about 10 per cent of the produce is reserved for seeds. Higher procurement will also create a problem of storage. Though capacity has increased over the last few years, lack of storage space causes the foodgrains to rot. The governmentís present storage capacity is 115 lakh tonnes but it wonít be enough given that produce from earlier years is still stocked. Last year, the governmentís production and procurement estimates had fallen below the target. The government is yet to officially announce the procurement target this season. Last year, it could procure 85 lakh tonnes against the original target of 115 lakh. The agriculture department estimates that the storage problem will aggravate due to the expected increase in the production of gram. The state accounts for nearly 40 per of the countryís gram production but usually the market price is higher than the MSP. Since farmers get more money, they sell to traders and the government is spared the burden of procuring and storing the crop. Agriculture department sources say the government could end up buying gram from farmers if its production touches 47 lakh tonnes. Food and Civil Supplies Minister Vijay Shah agrees there is a need to take effective steps to increase storage capacity given that agricultural production has been increasing every year. According to him, the present storage capacity is 61.40 lakh tonnes, which includes the space in private warehouses. He claims MP was the first state to have a warehousing and logistics policy. According to him, 1.40 lakh tonnes wheat was stored in silo bags in 2012-13. The warehousing corporation, however, claims MP wonít face any storage woes this time because it has already targeted a capacity of 152 lakh tonnes. The corporation says steel silos of capacity 50,000 tonnes each are being constructed in 10 districts. Meanwhile, the Madhya Pradesh Khet Mazdoor Congress has demanded that the number of centres for purchasing wheat and paddy be increased because farmers have to wait for days to sell their produce. The Congress alleges that the delay allows middlemen to benefit at farmersí cost.",Madhya Pradesh eyes new wheat high | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/madhya-pradesh-eyes-new-wheat-high/
942,"Related. Traditionally meant for hot and humid areas,bananas havenít been given much of a chance in Punjab. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) began researching the crop in 2007 and still maintains bananas cannot be a successful commercial bet. A Ludhiana farmer has,meanwhile,been defying the supposed odds and shown how it is done. Mewa Singh Kular of Kular village,Ludhiana,has been managing a three-acre banana farm since 2007 and harvested the fruit from plants grown in a poly net this year. His work has intrigued Punjab Agricultural University and the state agriculture department,which has sent officials to visit his farm and inspect what they thought wasnít possible. <U+0093>Inputs from the PAU research were very discouraging when I started growing bananas in 2007,<U+0094> says Kular,who has since formed a Punjab Banana Growersí Association with around 30 members. <U+0093>But I put in a lot of time and did various experiments to save my bananas from the biting frost of Punjab,which is the fruitís major enemy.<U+0094> Kular began by covering the crop with stabiliser sheets and finally found that the fruit harvested from poly net-covered plants not only tasted sweeter,but also ripened naturally on the trees without needing a ripening chamber. <U+0093>I planted around 10 plants in a poly net in September 2012 just for the sake of an experiment,<U+0094> he says. <U+0093>They started flowering in November and had fruits in December,which is the right harvesting period.î Among his experiments was farming baby corn alongside the bananas. <U+0093>This too was a success. It is still on in the open farm; poly net-protected farming has helped.<U+0094> Apart from taste and easy ripening,production too was good. <U+0093>The crop grown under the poly net gave a yield 1.5 to 2 times higher than crops grown outside. Now the average yield from my farm is 150 quintals per acre.<U+0094> Kular has created his own ripening chamber. <U+0093>We give the bananas a temperature of 18 to 22∞C in the chamber and they ripen in 4 days.<U+0094> The market rate for bananas is Rs 50 to 60 per dozen; Kular sells at Rs 25 after an announcement in the gurdwara. <U+0093>We send a vehicle full of bananas to the gurdwara and it returns empty,<U+0094> he says. Rajinder Singh,who has an 11-acre farm in Abbuwal village,now plans to grow bananas under a poly net. <U+0093>I was waiting for Kularís experiment to show results and now I too am going for it.<U+0094> Among the reasons why researchers had predicted no future for the banana were its irrigation requirements,the lack of marketing opportunities and the extreme care that is needed for the sensitive crop. <U+0093>The banana was introduced through the efforts of Dr G S Kalkat (now chairman of Punjab State Farmersí Commission). But it has failed to show expected results because there is no marketing scope,<U+0094> says agriculture director Dr Mangal Singh Sandhu,who visited Kularís farm along with PAU vice chancellor Dr B S Dhillon. <U+0093>What will farmers do with a fruit that nobody knows about and when PAU has failed to guide them? We have asked PAU to work on this aspect and guide farmers where they can sell their produce.<U+0094> The crop takes a lot of water and there are only one or two varieties that can sustain in Punjab,Sandhu adds. Sources in the PAU fruit sciences department claim banana research had been halted midway because of lack of funds,staff and interest. Dr M I S Gill,head of the department,denies this. <U+0093>We never stopped the research and we will soon recommend some new varieties,<U+0094> Gill says. <U+0093>But our observation till now is that it is not an easy crop to grow. Unless farmers put in an extra effort on care for this sensitive cropÖ it will be a complete failure. It can never compete with fruits like kinnow in Punjab,<U+0094> he said. Dr L S Brar,director for horticulture,too,maintains that banana is a crop meant for hot and humid regions,not Punjab. <U+0093>Farmers ready to put in all their efforts and modify technology can go for it but it cannot gain popularity. However it gives excellent returns if successful,<U+0094> Brar says. Banana,basically a cash crop,is imported from Gujarat,Maharashtra,Andhra Pradesh and Bihar in Punjab. Punjab buys bananas worth Rs 500 crore annually while its own production is only one per cent of the total consumption. As per PAU,the total area under banana cultivation was 170 hectares in 2012-13. G-9 (Grand Nine) is the only banana variety recommended by PAU for Punjab. Robusta and Dwarf Cavendish varieties too consume low quantities of water and are known to have been grown successfully in Punjab.","Punjab researchers wrote the banana off,this farmer didn<U+0092>t | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/punjab-researchers-wrote-the-banana-off-this-farmer-didnt/
943,"Related. Its vineyards thriving with high-quality fruit,Arunachal Pradesh ties up with Pune company for India<U+0092>s first homemade kiwi wine. Arunachal Pradesh is looking at the kiwi,or Chinese gooseberry,as a cash crop that would not only bring prosperity to its tribal cultivators but also allow setting up of a couple of units to manufacture kiwi wine,which in itself is a high-priced product on the national market. Last week,the Arunachal Pradesh Horticulture Produce Marketing and Processing Board (APHPMPB) signed an MoU with a Pune-based company,Hill Crest Foods and Beverages Pvt Ltd,for supply of the fruit for the manufacture of wine,initially as a pilot project. <U+0093>We have signed the MoU for initial supply of 3,500 kg kiwi,from which the company is supposed to produce 5,000 litres kiwi wine,<U+0094> said Tage Tatung,managing director of APHMPB. <U+0093>Once this project clicks,we propose to set up a manufacturing unit in Arunachal Pradesh so that it also helps generate employment.<U+0094> Tatung said the kiwi wine produced would be initially marketed in Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra before it is sent out to the national market. <U+0093>This will be first time kiwi wine will be produced in India,<U+0094> said Akalpit Arvind Prabhune,managing director of Rhythm Winery,a division of Hill Crest Foods. <U+0093>So long whatever little kiwi wine is available in the country is being imported from New Zealand. But as the demand is increasing and we have found very good quality kiwi fruits in Arunachal Pradesh,we are soon going to manufacture kiwi wine in Pune,which will be initially sold in Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh.<U+0094> Rhythm Winery is already producing strawberry and pineapple wine. <U+0093>There is a big market for refreshing wines that have very low alcohol content,and kiwi wine is one item that will be able to meet this demand,<U+0094> Prabhune said. The kiwi was introduced to Arunachal Pradesh in late 1992. From Dirang in West Kameng district then,kiwi cultivation has now spread to several other districts. Tatung said around 700 families have already taken up kiwi cultivation on a commercial level. <U+0093>When we first introduced about a dozen kiwi plants in the departmental apple nursery in Dirang in 1992,the farmers were not sure what exactly we were trying to tell them. They thought it was another variety of grape,<U+0094> Tatung said. <U+0093>But now farmers are increasingly asking for technical support to grow more kiwi plants,especially in Lower Subansiri,Anjaw,West Siang and West Kameng districts.<U+0094> Official estimates have put the total area under kiwi cultivation at a little over 3,000 hectares; the total production was 4,541 tonnes in 2011-12. While most of the fruit had so far been going out to the market through unorganised private channels,APHPMPB this year facilitated the sale of 20 tonnes to a Delhi-based company,Crop Connect,with farmers getting Rs 55 a kilogram. <U+0093>The entire lot of 20 tonnes that we supplied to Crop Connect comprised kiwi fruits that weighed 90 grams and over,<U+0094> Tatung said,describing the quality of kiwis grown in Arunachal Pradesh. The North-Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation (NERAMAC) too has been procuring kiwi from the state. Tatung said the climatic and soil conditions in Arunachal Pradesh,spread across the eastern Himalayas,are very favourable for kiwi cultivation. Moreover,the average size of each fruit is also satisfactory,with about 80 per cent weighing above 50 grams. The kiwi fruit originated from China (hence the popular name Chinese gooseberry),occuring naturally as a deciduous fruiting vine in southwestern China. It was introduced in New Zealand in the early 20th century,and acquired its current name. A commercial crop in several countries such as Italy,Greece and Chile,besides New Zealand,kiwi is also being cultivated in other northeastern states such as Nagaland,Meghalaya,Manipur and Assam. The fruit is packed with vitamin-C as well as numerous phytonutrients and minerals. The kiwi vine grows well between 900 and 1,600 metres above mean sea level wherever the climate is warm and humid. The plant flourishes under moderate and high rainfall conditions but can be easily destroyed by strong wind and frost during the growing period. While rainfall of about 150 cm is sufficient,the ideal summer temperature should be within 35 degrees because the fruits are vulnerable to sunburn. A deep friable sandy loam soil,well drained and supplied with irrigation,is ideal for growing kiwi vines.",The kiwi as a source of wine | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/the-kiwi-as-a-source-of-wine/

945,"Related. Discoloured paddy due to untimely rainfall have brought losses to Punjab farmers this season because it coincided with higher purchases by private agencies,which usually pay less. Such purchases picked up from 23.39 lakh tonnes last paddy season to 28.95 lakh tonnes this season,a jump of about 24 per cent. Paddy procurement by government agencies has dropped five per cent,as compared to the last paddy season. Looking at the figures,Mandi (market) Board chairman Ajmer Singh Lakhowal has asked officials to conduct an inquiry to find where paddy procured by private purchasers has been stocked so that they can establish the price at which they procured it from farmers and how it differs from the price at which they are putting it on sale. Mandi Board records say though the government had set a minimum support price of Rs 1,345 per quintal,the actual price has fallen as low as Rs 1,285 per quintal. A few varieties got up to Rs 2,500 per quintal. Purchases at low cost were made by private agencies alone,board sources say. They alleged that some agencies sought to cover up high sales,and cited the example of a sale of 135 bags being shown as 130 bags to remove all traces of purchases below the MSP. Lakhowal says,<U+0093>In the absence of any complaints from farmers,we are not able to act against any agency in particular. But we are investigating this racket at our own level because figures indicate that purchase by private agencies jumped 24 per cent,and our survey reveals that over 15 per cent paddy was sold below the MSP.<U+0094> As per the data till December 10,purchase by government agencies this year was 121.20 lakh tonnes against 127.39 lakh tonnes last year,a decrease of 5%. Farmers have already protested at various mandis over poor paddy procurement this season and over poor prices. There has been relief from the central government as far as discoloured paddy is concerned,but it apparently came too late. Last month,the Centre relaxed moisture content norms from 17 per cent to 21 per cent,and for discoloured paddy it relaxed the standard of 4 per cent damage to 12 per cent,with a cut of Rs 107 per quintal. The state rejected these norms as they were announced too late and over 85 per cent stock had already been sold in mandis. Meanwhile,basmati showed encouraging signs with arrivals in mandis and prices both doubling since last year around this time.",Paddy season off colour | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/paddy-season-off-colour/
946,"Related. In Punjab<U+0092>s first season of crop diversification,basmati scores on all counts,maize and cotton lose on production but gain on prices. The first results of Punjab<U+0092>s efforts at crop diversification are out. The crops the state is seeking to move towards,such as maize and cotton,have gained in prices,though there has also been a setback with bad weather pulling production of both crops below what it was even before the diversification. Punjab has adopted a policy under which it plans to divert around 12 lakh hectares from water-guzzling paddy to high-value crops in the next five to seven years. Implementation began this kharif season (April to October) and new crops were to be diverted to around 1.60 lakh hectares. According to Punjab Farmers<U+0092> Commission records,the state diverted 72,000 hectares to basmati (exceeding the initial target of 50,000 hectares),23,000 hectares to maize against the proposed 40,000 hectares,15,000 hectares to cotton against the proposed 50,000 hectares,over 20,000 hectares to sugarcane,and some area to agro-forestry,pulses,fruits and fodder. Rice is grown on 27-28 lakh hectares in Punjab,including 4-5 lakh hectares under basmati and the rest under paddy. The target for maize is 5.5 lakh hectares in the next five years; the addition of 23,000 hectares raised the existing area from 1.29 lakh hectares to 1.52 lakh. Other five-year targets include 7 lakh hectares each for basmati and cotton,2.6 lakh hectares for sugarcane,3 lakh hectares for agroforestry,1.2 lakh hectares for pulses,and 1 lakh hectares for fruits etc. Despite getting a larger field,maize and cotton have seen production dropping respectively by 24 and 29 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year. On the other hand,basmati has risen 55 per cent in terms of arrivals in mandis. Basmati. All three crops,however,have fetched good prices this year. For basmati,the state government did not announce the minimum support price it had promised,yet farmers earned Rs 3,500 to Rs 5,700 per quintal for Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1509,which are disease-resistant and high-yielding varieties,according to Punjab Mandi Board sources. The prices last year were Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000. According to the agriculture department,a farmer spends an average Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,800 on growing every quintal of basmati. Last year by December 5,11.05 lakh tonnes basmati had arrived in various markets; this year until the same date,17.10 lakh tonnes have arrived. Sources in the Mandi Board project this year<U+0092>s final basmati arrivals at 20 lakh tonnes against last year<U+0092>s 14.85 lakh tonnes. The chief minister,in public speeches,has been calling on farmers to opt for basmati rather than paddy,and been directing officials to promote basmati and even exempted it of taxes. Agriculture commissioner B S Sidhu says basmati growers earned well this season but stressed a focus on short-duration varieties to save groundwater and good marketing options to sustain diversification. Farmer Jaswant Singh,among those diversifying,says the MSP for paddy was Rs 1,350 but half the farmers sold at Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,100 to private players due to high moisture in a prolonged rainy season. Basmati,on the other hand,sold at rates three to five times higher than those of paddy as it is sown and harvested later. Mahinder Pal Singh of Jalandhar says he earned Rs. 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh from basmati grown on one acre,against Rs 40,000 to 45,000 paddy grown in the same area. Maize. Maize arrivals till December 4 were 17.94 lakh quintals in 2013 against 23.30 lakh quintals in 2012,a year that had closed at 27.73 lakh quintals. But the farmers got Rs 1,000 to 1,500 per quintal,against Rs 750 to 850 last year,says Mandi Board general manager G P S Randhawa. The government has distributed hybrid seeds at subsidy under the diversification policy. <U+0093>I grew maize on five acres but due to bad weather the entire crop got damaged and I sold it as fodder,<U+0094> says Joga Singh of Jandiala village in Jalandhar. <U+0093>But I earned well and will grow maize again; paddy is no longer profitable.<U+0094> His maize crop had looked very good but was so tall it got in the way of strong winds. <U+0093>The agriculture department must recommend short varieties with high yield during the rainy season,<U+0094> suggests Randhawa,the Mandi Board GM. The board has installed two first-of-their-kind-in-the-country maize driers,each of capacity 16 tonnes,to help boost the diversification policy. Maize is a high-moisture-content crop and driers can bring the content from 40 per cent to the required 14 per cent,says Randhawa,adding dried maize can be stored a long time and fetch good prices. <U+0093>We are planning to purchase smaller,6-tonne driers for installation across the state,<U+0094> he says. Jagtar Singh,who grows maize at Saila Khurad in Hoshiarpur,says using the drier helped him sell at prices he had never got before. Cotton. Cotton till December 5 reached 13.95 lakh quintals in 2013 against 19.55 lakh quintals in 2012,a year that had closed at 83.36 lakh quintal,according to the Mandi Board. Farmers got good rates for cotton,too,thanks to procurement by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) at Rs 5,100 per quintal against the Rs 4,500 offered by private players. Last year,the rates were Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,000 per quintal. The Centre has fixed the minimum support price at Rs 3,900 per quintal; what the CCI has offered is higher. Where Punjab is lagging is in agro-forestry,pulses etc. The forest cover is just 7 per cent against a minimum requirement of 20 per cent,says agriculture commissioner Sidhu. To review the first result of crop diversification,Punjab has constituted an expert committee under Punjab State Farmers<U+0092> Commission chairman G S Kalkat. Having prepared a diversification programme of Rs 5,000 crore,the state has got Rs 224.50 crore for the first season from the agriculture ministry. The Centre had earmarked Rs 500 crore for promoting crop diversification during the current financial year. Punjab got serious only after being pulled up by the Central Ground Water Board,which asked it to decrease around 10 lakh hectares under paddy,and comments from Agriculture Minister Sharad Yadav,who said Punjab<U+0092>s paddy may not be required for the central pool. During the 2002-07 Congress regime in Punjab,too,an attempt at diversification had been made through contract farming. It failed and could not bring even 25 per cent of the targeted area under new crops. That plan was closed in 2012.",Diverse first results | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/diverse-first-results/

According to the fatherís statement, the father and son duo came and started arguing with him about the complaints and a property related issue. Following this, he was shot at by the youth with a countrymade pistol. As bullet brushed his left leg, the duo fled. A passerby called the police and he was rushed to the hospital. DSP (South) Surjit Singh Malik said, ìThe minorís father had taken a loan of Rs 35, 000 from the father-son duo. The accused have the papers of his residence. The youth allegedly kidnapped and molested his youngest daughter. After he was released, the victimís family lodged another complaint was given against the youth. They alleged that he was threatening them.î",Molestation accused ëshoots atí girlís father | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/molestation-accused-shoots-at-girls-father/

Putting to rest the speculation on who will head the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) after February 17 when UK Sinhaís three-year term comes to an end, the government has decided to extend Sinhaís term as the chairman of the regulator for a period of two years. Sinha will now head the regulatory body till March 16, 2016, a source close to the development told The Indian Express. Sinha who took charge as the Sebi chairman on February 18, 2011, from CB Bhave, who did not get an extension after his term came to an end in February 2011. In fact, among the last four chairmen, Sinha is the only one whose term has been extended. His three predecessors ó GN Bajpai (2002-2005), M Damodaran (2005-2008) and CB Bhave (2008-2011) ó had only got a three-year terms. DR Mehta, with a term of seven years, is the only Sebi chief to have held the post for a longer duration than Sinha. While the three whole-time members at Sebi had a five year term, Sinha was the only one with a three year term. A senior Sebi official, however, said that the move was on expected lines. Being an election year, the development will lead to certainty on regulatory moves and will also provide Sinha with the time to focus on unfinished agendas. Sinha had joined Sebi after serving as the chairman and MD of UTI AMC amidst the noise around the alleged 2G spectrum allocation scam where several listed companies were allegedly involved. This was the time when the mutual fund industry was also trying to cope up with the no-entry load regime. Over the last three years Sinha had taken several steps to revive the mutual fund industry, to improve and expedite the IPO process and in the area of curbing insider trading practices. However, Sebiís strong moves against illegal collective investment schemes and also against the Sahara Group, under his tenure, where it went up to the Supreme Court for refund of investorís money amounting to up to Rs 24,000 crore, have been noteworthy. Sinha also called for powers of search and seizure, access to call data records and powers to recover its dues to enhance Sebiís power, which have already been provided to it through an ordinance passed by the President. Talking about the issues of future, the Sebi chairman had earlier in an interview to The Indian Express told that the regulator needs to be better prepared for technological challenges on risk management, work towards enhancing trust in the market and increase retail participation.

950,"Summary. Retail inflation slowed to a three-month low of 9.87 per cent in December from 11.24 per cent in November, helped by falling vegetable prices, government data showed on Monday. The moderation that may allow the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to leave policy rates untouched in its third-quarter monetary policy review on January 28. During the month, vegetable price inflation eased to 38.8 per cent compared with 61.6 per cent in the previous month. In its mid-quarter policy review on 18 December, the RBI kept its policy rate unchanged at 7.75 per cent, pegging its hopes on a drop in the inflation rate because of an expected fall in food prices. The RBI had then cautioned that if the expected softening of food inflation does not materialise, ìthe Reserve Bank will act, including on off-policy dates if warrantedî. Data issued on Friday showed the countryís factory output shrank for a second straight month in November by 2.1 per cent due to a sharp decline in production of consumer durables, signalling that economic recovery may take longer than earlier expected. The annual Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation had accelerated to a 14-month high in November to 7.52 per cent in November from 7 per cent a month ago. Indications are that the upcoming WPI data set for release on Wednesday is likely to capture a sharp moderation in price levels. Fruit price inflation rose 14.64 per cent compared to 15 per cent in November. Pulses were up 2.15 per cent, cereals by 12.14 per cent and milk products by 9.87 per cent in December. Protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish became dearer by 12.64 per cent in December as compared to 11.96 per cent in the previous month. Inflation in the food and beverages segment was 12.16 per cent as against 14.72 per cent recorded in November. The data showed that the provisional inflation for rural and urban areas for December was 10.49 per cent and 9.11 per cent, respectively.",Retail inflation dips to three-month low in Dec | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/retail-inflation-dips-to-three-month-low-in-dec/

In a pre-election largesse of sorts, the Employeesí Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Monday announced an interest rate of 8.75 per cent on retirement savings in 2013-14 as well as a 20 per cent rise in benefits under the related Employeesí Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI). ìWe have decided to recommend to the government 8.75 per cent rate of interest for 2013-14 to its subscribers,î said labour and employment minister Oscar Fernandes after a meeting of the EPFOís Central Board of Trustees (CBT). The recommendation will now be ratified by the finance ministry and then formally notified. The decision would benefit nearly 8 crore subscribers of the EPFO, which along with exempt PF trusts has a corpus of Rs 7 lakh crore. Though this is marginally higher than the 8.5 per cent return in last fiscal, it has, however, failed to please trade union leaders who pointed out that it should have at least matched the retail inflation rate. But the higher interest payout, a last minute revision to the original proposal that sought to keep the rate unchanged, was possible due to a surplus of Rs 43.14 crore. According to calculations, the EPFO has a total liability of Rs 25,005.41 crore in 2013-14 and an estimated income of Rs 25,048.55 crore. ìThe fund can very clearly give an interest rate of 8.75 per cent as there is a surplus and concerns over the interest suspense account and inoperative accounts have been fully addressed,î said Central Provident Fund Commissioner KK Jalan. The CBT, the apex decision making body of the EPFO, also announced an interim increase in benefits under the EDLI by 20 per cent up to a maximum of Rs 1,56,000. Under this scheme, the family of a worker will get 20 times the average wage of the worker over the last 12 months subject to a ceiling of Rs 1,30,000 in case of his or her demise during the service period. ìThe meeting also approved a proposal for an actuarial evaluation of the scheme. This is an ad hoc measure until we get the report,î said Jalan. The CBT also hiked minimum administrative charges for managing EPF and EDLI schemes to Rs 500 and Rs 200 a month per member for contributing establishments.","For 2013-14, PF savings will earn 8.75% interest | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/for-2013-14-pf-savings-will-earn-8-75-interest/

In the latest edition of Express Adda,which was held in Delhi last week,actor Irrfan recapitulated his journey in Indian cinema. Presented by Yes Bank in association with IIFL and Olive Beach,the evening had Irrfan in conversation with Shekhar Gupta,Editor-in-Chief,The Express Group,and Priyanka Sinha Jha,Editor,Screen. The freewheeling discussion had the actor address a range of subjects <U+0097> Bollywood vs Indian cinema,the Rs 100-crore club and on experimenting with roles. It is not just the word <U+0093>Bollywood<U+0094>; it is about the whole abduction of culture. We are selling ourselves,and in the process,losing our value. I have a problem with that kind of mentality. Our cinema was not like that. It has a peculiar way of telling stories with song and dance and that<U+0092>s unique. Why can<U+0092>t we understand our own language of cinema? Why can<U+0092>t we have our own identity? Why do we have to put <U+0093>wood<U+0094> after our name? I also have a strange relationship with the Rs 100-crore club. It is good that the film business is increasing rapidly <U+0097> at 30 per cent annually <U+0097> but media gives too much importance to it. It categorises and judges a film on the basis of collection. Filmmaking is not just commerce,it<U+0092>s about telling stories. On bringing his characters home. Sometimes there is no choice but to bring the character home. It is so intense that you can<U+0092>t afford to leave him even for a day. For instance,when I was doing The Namesake,the character needed that kind of involvement that I had to live with him all the time,whether I liked it or not. I was in the US for three months. I became socially useless and could not talk to people because my character was so complicated. At other times,the character does not stay with you. It can be switched on and off. So it is the character that tells you that whether you have to live with it. Sometimes the character says it is a one-night stand,whenever you want to come and make love with me,come and make love with me and go. You are free. There were characters that I consciously kept with me. They<U+0092>re more like life partners. There were also characters I wanted to shake off as soon as the shooting finished. Hollywood projects. It was very pleasant to work with the likes of Angelina Jolie and Natalie Portman. They are very professional and make films for the whole world,not just the US. They have captured European cinema and now,they might capture Indian cinema too. They have been making realistic films for a long time; there is a culture of realism which we have never had. If we would have understood our own language,we could have pushed it internationally <U+0097> unless you have your own local language,it can never become international. There was a time in Indian cinema when the directors were inspired,hopeful,had their own language and were popular. This includes Mehboob Khan,K Asif,Bimal Roy,Guru Dutt,Raj Kapoor and Raj Khosla. They were using dance and drama,still telling complex stories. Now,our films are one-dimensional. Whatever is being said on the surface,it<U+0092>s just that. There is nothing beneath it. Commercial cinema needs to have a bigger range. On being stereotyped. If you are getting acknowledgment for something,there is a temptation to keep it with you and you don<U+0092>t want to lose that because,basically,you are looking for acknowledgment. There was an interesting incident with a very popular star. He was delivering one hit after another. When somebody asked him,<U+0093>why don<U+0092>t you do some hatke (different) films<U+0094>,he said,<U+0093>Boss aisa hai,jab gaadi theek chal rahi hai na toh uska bonnet uthake nahi dekhna chahiye.<U+0094> I want to grow. I want people who want me to grow,but not in a way that I have to do things that I don<U+0092>t like. On experimenting with roles. Every character is unique. You cannot prepare for one role like you did for the other. Sometimes when a role comes,you have no clue as to how you are going to prepare for it. There are certain aspects of characters that you immediately know. For instance,for Paan Singh Tomar,I had to learn running and understand what steeplechase is all about. When there is a physicality involved,you understand it,but connecting to the character<U+0092>s mental construction takes time. You have to wait. It<U+0092>s like falling in love,it will happen when it has to happen,you can<U+0092>t force it. I think at the time when I accepted The Namesake,it was very risky. It didn<U+0092>t turn out like that though. It eventually became my strength. I had done Maqbool,Haasil and Charas <U+0097> all these roles were larger than life,and suddenly I got a part where I had to be a person who is non-existent. I didn<U+0092>t know how to do it but when I did the film,it made me realise how to demolish my own traps. Since childhood,I have been craving to do a love story. I keep finding these spaces in Maqbool or Haasil and The Lunchbox. I wish filmmakers see the possibility that I can carry a love story,that I can entertain people. I die to play love stories. On the changing industry. The industry is changing every week and it<U+0092>s getting better. New directors are coming. Also,audiences wants to see something substantial. They are exposed to all kinds of cinema through the Internet and DVDs. They are demanding,they expect our stories to carry a unique way of storytelling. In Hollywood,theatres are mostly empty but here,we don<U+0092>t have any other means to pass time. There are so many actors who are waiting at the brink and they will explode. It<U+0092>s because certain interesting films got successful,the industry is getting more confident about making these films. You will see some interesting talent and cinema coming up. express features service. Irrfanisms. D-day (2013) It had action and adventure. We stuck to the details and complexity of how R&AW functions and tried to make drama out of it,making it engaging in the commercial format. Paan Singh Tomar (2012) It was the character with whom I identified the most and one that I carried with me after the film. There was something about my father in that character,something of my own aspirations,something about the way he carried himself. Shadows of Time (2004) The director (Florian Gallenberger) was very promising and the script was excellent. Everybody had high hopes,but I don<U+0092>t know why the film did not work. Maqbool (2003) When Vishal Bhardwaj told me he is doing an adaptation of Macbeth,I immediately asked him how would he do an adaptation of his guilt. He told me about the incident when Maqbool does not know whose child Nimmi is carrying and I was fascinated by that. For me,that was my first love story. It was very special. People still watch that film. Banegi Apni Baat (1993-97) That was when privatisation of television channels was just happening. Television gave me a chance to get acquainted with the camera. I came here to be an actor in Indian cinema and not television. At that time,people used to talk about me as an actor but I used to wait for filmmakers to call and give me a chance in their films.",I wish filmmakers see that I can carry a love story: Irrfan | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/i-wish-filmmakers-see-that-i-can-carry-a-love-story-irrfan/

Kapil Sibal,Minister of Communications and Information Technology and the new law minister,was the guest at the latest edition of Express Adda in Mumbai. In a conversation with Shekhar Gupta,Editor-in-Chief,The Express Group,and filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj,he spoke about development and corruption,as well as on being a poet and a member of the ruling establishment. On governance at the centre. When asked about issues that have crippled the government in Delhi,Kapil Sibal shifted the blame to the nature of the polity,the complexity of the nation and. institutions in the country. <U+0093>You want to take them on board but they don<U+0092>t come on board,polity is fractured,there is no meeting ground,<U+0094> said Sibal,adding that other than the three Ds <U+0097> debate,discussion and decision <U+0097> the opposition has adopted a fourth D <U+0097> disruption. <U+0093>Even on issues such as education,where everyone is together,the Parliament is not able to pass simple bills. So,the answer is,<U+0091>It<U+0092>s (the problem) not with the government,it is the nature of our polity,the way in which we run our institutions and the lack of principles on the basis of which the nation has to move forward,<U+0092><U+0094> he said. On CAG and the courts. Sibal took on Vinod Rai,days after the latter completed his term as the CAG. He said that the reasons given by the outgoing CAG as the basis of a loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the state exchequer due to spectrum allocation was flawed. Sibal also took a swipe at the judiciary claiming that the courts do not know the government<U+0092>s functioning and cannot get involved in policy making. Stating that those who are assigned to do the job must be left to do it,he said that,under the Constitution,the government is assigned to delineate the economic policy and it should be left to do that. The courts are required to strike down things if these are unconstitutional and they should do that and weed out any corruption they find. <U+0093>No institution is doing what it is supposed to do under the Constitution. The executive is not responding in the appropriate manner,the legislature is not functioning and the courts are going beyond their jurisdiction. In this situation,how does the country move forward?<U+0094> he asked. Taking on the media. Sibal was critical of 24/7 news channels. He claimed that he rarely watches news channels and seldom appears on TV shows. He also raised concern over the. perception that electronic media builds up among. people and the judiciary. <U+0093>When somebody gives a figure of Rs 1.76 lakh crore and the electronic media talks about it 24/7 for months,then public discourse gets vitiated. Courts,too,believe that something dreadful has happened and take it up. The atmosphere created makes the courts some times do things in context of. the massive outrage expressed on television channels and that is a very worrisome thing,<U+0094> he said. being both,a poet and A politician. Sibal recited some of his poems including the one he had written on the Delhi gang rape in December. He told the audience that he had inherited poetry and his house has always been full of poems by Mohd Iqbal,Mirza Ghalib and others. Filmmaker and music composer Vishal Bhardwaj and filmmaker-lyricist Gulzar pointed out that Sibal appeared to be pained at the state of the country but was constrained even though in power. The minister answered that changing the lives of 1.2 billion people would not take five or 10 years,but 30 years. He said <U+0093>change will come,we will become a great country and give the people the rights they deserve<U+0094>. He added that,on the one hand,there is a poet who feels and,on the other,there is a politician who wants to do something to make a difference. <U+0093>Our job out there is to decide; if I do it with a clean heart,30 per cent of my decisions may be wrong. Fine,I am fallible,mortal,but at least,I must feel for my people and decide for my people and those are my obligations,<U+0094> he said. On the Opposition. Sibal highlighted the problems of working with a non-co-operative Opposition. Drawing parallels with a company,Sibal said that one can provide the required leadership,treat the opposition as family and make them understand one<U+0092>s vision. <U+0093>But that is very difficult in politics as your vision is not in sync with that of the Opposition.You can<U+0092>t treat them as family because they treat you as an enemy,you can hear their views but many of their views are only because they are in Opposition,<U+0094> he said. <U+0093>This is not a river that runs down together. These are streams that enter into the ocean and you don<U+0092>t know which stream is doing what and you have a confluence where there is no commonality of interests because the only desire is to come to power in 2014,<U+0094> he added. When Shekhar Gupta interjected,<U+0093>Or,if I may put it the other way <U+0097> to stay on in power in 2014.<U+0094> Sibal responded,<U+0093>Come to power also means to stay on in power. We also want to come to power.<U+0094> On the need for quality education. Having seen the situation of education closely as human resources development minister in the past,Sibal said that huge investments are needed in the field of education. While 220 million children go to school in India,the number of children going to university in the age group of 18-24 was 12.4 per cent while the global average stood at 28 per cent and more than 40 per cent in developed economies. He pointed out that if the children don<U+0092>t get the education,health and skills they need,<U+0093>we will become a nation where people will be roaming the streets and there will be no jobs<U+0094>. On legalising betting. On the subject,Sibal said,<U+0093>Is the nation ready to accept it? Is it willing to legalise it? I don<U+0092>t know. The states will decide that. If you ask me,in principle,<U+0091>Yes,but is the country ready for it? But,on fixing we will make a law.<U+0092><U+0094> Question hour. Everyone knows that gambling is rampant in cricket. Why is the government not thinking of generating revenue from this? With proper laws,you can generate revenue worth Rs 10,000 cr? Betting and gambling,and fixing a match are two entirely different contexts. Betting and gambling<U+0092>s jurisdiction is entirely with the state government. State governments have a right to pass a law on this and they should if the legislature so desires,but we in the Government of India can<U+0092>t pass it as a law. We don<U+0092>t have the jurisdiction to do so. A lot of things that happen in the country are not related to making money; there is an ethos,there is a lakshmanrekha that we haven<U+0092>t crossed. People look upon leaders to set an example; that<U+0092>s why Nehru,Gandhi and Patel are part of our legacy. What is your view on the current decline in morality at the top? You can apply the principles of the freedom movement to the country today. I don<U+0092>t think there can be a Mahatma Gandhi in the 21st century in India; there was one then because the situation demanded it. Take the nature of the electorate in this country. There are people who come to me and ask for their child<U+0092>s admission into some school,to regularise their unauthorised construction and so on. Where do you start? You are right that leaders should set an example but with 1.2 billion people,of which 600 million people live in penury,what do you expect? You will find these bad pennies anywhere in any political system because those who have are greedy. The needy would do anything to get basic necessities,and I don<U+0092>t call that corruption. Corruption is when those who have,want more and change the rules of the game to get more. When Manmohan Singh took over,it was like a whiff of fresh air,with people thinking that there could be no better person to lead. Does it now bother you that the worst dent to Brand India has happened under him? This decline started in October 2010. If you keep hearing in the media that we are corrupt,we cannot perform,it sends a message that this nation is up to nothing. However,what is the reality on the ground? We achieved a historic agriculture production of 260 million tonnes,agricultural credit of Rs 4.50 lakh crore,the economy grew at an average of 8 per cent,consumption in the rural sector has grown at an average of 3.5 per cent. If you take any sector,it has progressed under Dr Manmohan Singh. But what do you get to hear <U+0097> Rs 1.76 lakh crore scam,Rs 2.50 lakh crore scam. Every day,the media shows that the country is full of scams. Negative news sells. This is not to say that we could not have done better. There is a perception that there has been a decline in moral values of India over the last few decades in politics,business,sports and so on. What can India do in the fields of law and technology to arrest this decline? If you look anywhere in the world today,corruption is on an increase. The global economy is getting more and more liberalised and the private sector has no qualms. We must move towards a technology-driven society. All our public services must be available on the Net and we are doing that. If you remove the intermediaries from the system and directly connect the consumer,by and large,you will eliminate corruption. The law can be a deterrent,but not a solution. After the law on rape was passed,I think more rape cases are being heard,which means there is something wrong in the level of development of society. It<U+0092>s the mindset of men in this country. (After Kapil Sibal recited a poem asking God for powers) A lot of people will say that if this man,who is in power,is himself asking for help from God,who should we approach? Is there a dichotomy? There is no dichotomy. You want to change things in your industry,but how much have you been able to change? You are a revolutionary and yet you have not been able to change things in your industry. That does not mean you are not a great or radical poet. It all depends on the nature of the power; you should exercise your power with honesty and with the intent to change. I also think that you must reflect on what is within you,only then will people come to know what the problems are.",ëNo institution is doing what it should under the Constitutioní | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/no-institution-is-doing-what-it-should-under-the-constitution/

Taking a dig at institutions in the country,Sibal said that those who are assigned to do a job must be left to do the job but no institution is doing what it is supposed to under the constitution. He also said that the courts were going beyond their jurisdiction. <U+0093>The executive is not responding in the appropriate manner,the legislature is not functioning and the courts are going beyond their jurisdiction.

Sibal said the opposition was playing politics purely with the desire to win power in 2014 and was not allowing important legislations to be passed. He also took a dig at the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India for the presumptive loss theory in the Coal blocks allotment case. <U+0093>We agreed on each of the bills,yet it is not passed. We have the solutions but for those solutions to work people have to collaborate,<U+0094> Sibal said referring to the ruling alliance and the opposition. Sibal said he has stopped watching news channels and blamed the media for what he said was the hype they create around certain issues and claimed that this even ends up misleading the courts. <U+0093>When somebody gives a figure of 1.76 lakh crore,media talks about it 24◊7 for months and the public discourse gets vitiated.

If our allies say that no CMP is required and every party that is a component of the NDA can go ahead with its own agenda,we can go to the people with the agenda. As far as pre-poll alliance is concerned,there is no proposal right now to increase the number of allies. However,maybe in the future we could get so much strength in the Lok Sabha that we will not need allies. Even if we get a clear majority in the next elections,the government that we will form will have the participation of our existing allies. On the UPA government<U+0092>s performance. The Congress-led UPA<U+0092>s performance in the last nine years has disappointed people. On any front,be it economic,internal and external security or diplomacy,the government is a failure. The Congress-led UPA has lost its credibility and this is not an exaggeration. When we fight elections,it will not be only on the negative aspects of the Congress government. We will also bring forth our positive issues about the vision our party has for the country. As soon as I became president,I called for the drafting of a vision document. We will go with a vision and positive issues to the people and ask for votes. On reluctance of parties to join hands with the BJP. In 1998,when we first formed the government under Vajpayeeji,we did not have many allies. However,after that the government that we ran included 24 allies. The skill to run a coalition government is only with the BJP,which we proved by running the government for six years. A lot of regional parties have their own problems if they join hands with some national party,their vote bank could get affected. So,they don<U+0092>t want to join hands with a national party. The alliance of the Congress with its allies was not pre-poll,it happened after the elections. When the Congress emerged as the single largest party,that is when the alliance happened. On India<U+0092>s need for a new economic model. The Congress-led government has created a gloomy picture of the economy which needs to be changed. The economic model which we have adopted in the last 65 years has created economic disparity and civil unrest similar to what Maoism and extremism did. We need to think about an alternative economic model. India does not need to ape the US economic model. On his idea of Hindutva. People think that Hinduism is a caste or a religion. Parties which have only vote bank politics on their minds,call us communal. In its verdict,the Supreme Court has defined Hindutva as a way of life. It cannot be limited to caste,creed or religion. Hindutva can never create hatred between people. There is a festival,Nag Panchami,where people,who believe in the ideology of Hindutva,feed milk to serpents. So,those who believe in this ideology cannot sow hatred between people. We have run a government in the country. We have shown that we do not discriminate on the basis of religion. Whoever is born in this country belongs to this nation. However,I would like to say that it is unfortunate,but the most communal party is the Congress. Since Independence,the brotherhood that should have been created between communities was not done. Instead,they propagated vote bank politics. On L K Advani. Advaniji is our guardian. He had raised some concerns but certainly it was not against Modi<U+0092>s elevation as chairman of the campaign committee. Advaniji is a highly respected leader. His contribution in building the party along with Vajpayeeji cannot be overlooked. In a family,a father sometimes makes a point against a child no matter how intelligent or good he/she is. Similarly,Advaniji said that in the same tone. On Narendra Modi. I have just declared Modi the chairman of the election campaign committee. We very well understand the mood of the people of India. Rest assured,we will take the right decision at an appropriate time. On party dissent. Since it was formed,the BJP has seen leaders come and go. In India,there are only three national political parties <U+0097> the Congress,the BJP and the Communists. These parties have seen vertical divisions. The Congress saw a vertical division and the Communists have seen vertical divisions. The BJP is the only party where some people may have left the party for various reasons but there was never a vertical division in the party because this party is committed to its ideology and political thought. Some people get angry and leave their homes but they return after a few days. On the BJP<U+0092>s foreign policy. The BJP wants to have cordial relations with all nations. Our policy will not be like that of the Congress,of getting close to a country at one time and then with another the next moment. We would want to be equidistant with everyone and have cordial relations with everyone. We do not have good relations with any of our neighbours. It is a diplomatic failure. About Pakistan,I would like to say that we want better relations with them. On the party<U+0092>s stand on economic reforms. We are not against economic reforms. The process of economic liberalisation had started even before the NDA government. Economic reforms have always been high on our agenda. But we have always ensured that the autonomy of the Indian economy is not compromised. voice bank. A 60-year-old is considered unfit to run a company in India Inc,but in politics,nobody questions 60-65-year-old leaders. What is. your opinion? Rajnath Singh: Psychology should be the base,not age. The factors which need to be considered are whether the person can overcome circumstances and give new ideas. It is not about being young or old. Moreover,old leaders also bring along experience,which is significant. It cannot be overlooked. In my central BJP team,85 per cent of the office-bearers are younger than 55. Shouldn<U+0092>t you ban the word <U+0091>Hindu<U+0092> and use secular instead? Minorities are afraid of the BJP because of Hindutva. Rajnath Singh: I don<U+0092>t think the word <U+0091>Hindu<U+0092> should be banned,it is our ideology. Why should anybody hesitate to say <U+0091>I am a Hindu<U+0092>,or <U+0091>I am a Muslim<U+0092> or <U+0091>I am a Christian<U+0092>? The BJP always talks of cultural nationalism and integral humanism. The Congress has no problems in its alliance with the Muslim League and calls itself secular. But the BJP which does not believe in discrimination is not secular. It<U+0092>s time people know the truth. Political discourse in Parliament has declined. There is no business happening as the government and the Opposition are at loggerheads. Rajnath Singh: I agree with you. But if the government fails to respond to the Opposition,how are we to blame? We had demanded the resignation of railway minister Pawan Kumar Bansal. We raised objections to law minister Ashwani Kumar<U+0092>s violation of Supreme Court directives. Had the government heeded our demands,Parliament would have worked. But they adjourned Parliament two days ahead and then sacked the corrupt ministers. What will be the continuity and the change in a Narendra Modi-led BJP and the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP? Rajnath Singh: The BJP has its own ideology,principles and programmes. Based on this,we run our government and our political party. Even if the leadership changes,there will not be a variance. For example,the economic changes done by Atal Bihari Vajpayee were based on the vision of the party. In the future,there may be some minute changes. that we cannot ignore. But,all in all,things will not change too much.",ëThere is no plan to look for allies for a pre-poll tie-upí | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/there-is-no-plan-to-look-for-allies-for-a-prepoll-tieup/
956,"A grievance redress system must provide a decentralised system for receiving and dealing with complaints. The wake-up call from the AAP that halted the BJP in its tracks in Delhi appears to have finally awakened the Sangh Parivar. Both Parivar weeklies contrast the youth participation at the ìSankalp Mahashivirî organised by the RSS at Jabalpur with the angry youth response against Prashant Bhushanís controversial remarks on Kashmir and mark it as a new ìawakeningî: ìThe presence of a large number of youth at the Shivir was indication of the RSSís growing popularity and acceptability among the younger generation,î said a report in the Organiser. An editorial in Panchjanya clubs this underlying assumption with that of the angry reaction against Bhushan to make a point about the disenchantment with the AAP: ìPrashant Bhushan has not only burnt his fingers by his disturbing remarks but also cleared the air over his partyís illusion that youth will be up in arms with the broomÖ on all issues, good or bad,î says the editorial, referring to the suggested referendum on the deployment of security forces in Kashmir. While the editorial admits that the attack on the AAPís office cannot be condoned, it reminds the AAP that these angry sentiments reflect disapproval of its opinions on some issues. AGAINST NATURE An article in Panchjanya declared homosexuality ìunnaturalî and blamed psychological factors for it: ìIt is clear that psychological attitudes contribute to the development of these tendenciesÖî The article claims that it was against the order of nature because ìit is a well-known fact that the prevalence of AIDS is markedly higher among homosexuals. This reflects natureís disapproval of homosexualityî. The article also argues that ìhad nature been in favour of homosexuality, nature would have provided avenues for its growthî. It rejects suggestions that the right to equality derives from the ìpleasureî they seek. ìThe pleasure in sexual intercourse should only be considered as an inducement for procreation. Any such pleasure that is solely for the purpose of recreation and does not result in procreation is not appropriateÖî It claims that ìhomosexuality is fuelled by the selfish characteristic of Western societiesî, to suggest that this should not be given ìsympatheticî treatment and should be ìdiscouragedî. The article is accompanied by a report on the VHPís endorsement of the Supreme Court ruling declaring that ìnot only the court but the entire country is angryî with homosexuality. LASHKAR VOLCANO While the Congress and BJP spar over claims of the LeT trying to recruit from Muzaffarnagar, a report in the Organiser emphasises the need to ìact wiselyî and not to ìwait for the volcano to explodeî. While the report talks of the alleged patronage of local Samajwadi Party leaders and Muslim leaders in sustaining the refugee camps, it trains its guns on the alleged terror links of the Deoband seminary. ìDeoband is believed to be the heaven for terrorists. Even the Taliban enjoy links with Deoband. Masood Azhar, who was released during the Kandahar plane hijacking by India, had stayed in Deoband for two and a half months. He even stayed in Darulís guesthouse for some time,î the article reminds readers, in order to demand that the government be extra-cautious of the BJPís prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modiís security during his upcoming Meerut rally. ìThe intelligence department and the police also need to be given a free hand to expose the conspiracyÖ Otherwise the volcano on which the entire western Uttar Pradesh is sitting can explode any time,î it cautions.",View from the right: Anti-AAP | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/view-from-the-right-anti-aap/

958,"NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India may keep interest rates ""steady"" in its monetary policy review later this month and a rate cut is likely only in the next financial year , according to an SBI research report. With inflation easing, industry has clamoured for a reduction in interest rates. However, according to SBI, the central bank may keep rates on hold at its quarterly monetary policy scheduled on January 28. Wholesale inflation declined to a five-month low of 6.16 per cent in December as food article prices cooled, according to data released yesterday. Retail inflation eased to a three-month low of 9.87 per cent. ""RBI may keep rates steady in January 2014 review and wait for more information, particularly on trajectory of food inflation, before deciding next course of policy action because core inflation has remained more or less flat in December 2013,"" the report said. Prices as measured by the Wholesale Price Index , gained at the slowest pace since July 2013, when inflation was 5.8 per cent. In November, WPI increased 7.52 per cent, the fastest pace in 14 months. SBI said WPI inflation may settle at about 6 per cent and Consumer Price Index inflation at about 9 per cent by February. CPI inflation of less than 9 per cent is a possibility if WPI inflation contracts at a faster pace and as the election season gets closer. ""An overall assessment therefore suggests that a rate cut is likely only in the next financial year,"" SBI said. Meanwhile, industry chambers have pitched for lower interest rates to prop up growth. Industrial output in November contracted 2.1 per cent, the worst performance in six months. The RBI had kept key policy rates unchanged last month on expectations that wholesale and retail inflation would ease. The central bank had increased the key policy rate (repo) twice between September and November to check inflation.

It has been a tumultuous year,with political fortunes hanging in the balance and members of the power elite losing face and authority. It was also a year when two political parties ditched the ruling UPA,adding complexity to the task of choosing hundred most powerful people in India. Power is defined as the ability to influence people and events but with the government and ruling party dysfunctional and directionless for much of the year,it is no surprise that there are dramatic changes in the list. Adding to the churn has been Anna Hazareís anti-corruption movement which started with a bang and ended in a whimper. Little wonder then that no less than 27 individuals on last yearís power list have dropped out,to be replaced by new names. Power,as they say,abhors a vacuum. Of the 27 new names,15 are politicians,proving that in India,the power elite are still those who occupy pivotal positions in government or the opposition. It also reflects the fact that in coalition politics,regional satraps are wielding greater clout than before. Yet,those who occupy certain official positions,will,regardless of their actions,or lack of them,continue to exercise power. That is the matrix which our selection team<U+0097>comprising Indian Express editors and reporters who track politics,business,society and sports<U+0097>took into account while finalising the list. Interestingly,there are only seven businessmen in the top 50,suggesting that corporate clout is no longer what it used to be in terms of influencing policy. Ultimately,power is not just about positions of authority,it can also be a negative force,the power to oppose or block the passage of crucial legislation. In essence,The Indian Express Power List is a reflection of the power struggle that has been in evidence over the past 12 months. On the positive side,there is a flowering of the creative arts,with the number of individuals connected to cinema and music showing an increase over last year,along with sportspersons,while the supercrats,those who occupy positions of power in the establishment,or <U+0093>the system,<U+0094> also moving up the ladder.

His incremental role in decision-making in the party is likely to coincide with a gradual withdrawal of president Sonia Gandhi from day-to-day party affairs. Power Punch. At the AICC session in Jaipur in January,his invocation of the sacrifices made by the Nehru-Gandhi family drove party office-bearers to tears. He asserted his authority as No. 2 in the party with a series of meetings with senior party leaders. What Next. His electoral appeal and political acumen will be tested once again as several states go to the polls. Oops moment. ìIf I get married and have children,then I will become a status quoistÖî For now,it<U+0092>s status quo. By The Way. Of late,he has turned vegetarian. 2. Narendra Modi, 62. Chief Minister,Gujarat. Rank í12: 14. Why. The year before the big election,he is the Challenger. He has made himself out to be the undeclared prime ministerial candidate of the BJP,without waiting for the central leadership to name him. As the Congress-led government battles inertia and indecisiveness,he has packaged himself as the doer with his development pitch,though his critics dispute his claims and the ghosts of 2002 will continue to haunt him. Power Punch. Won his third Gujarat elections. Was made a member of the party<U+0092>s highest decision-making bodies,the parliamentary board and central election committee. The decision by Britain to engage with him just before the Assembly elections suggests he might have managed to acquire wider acceptance. What Next. The frontrunner among BJP prime-ministerial candidates,he has one year to win over party and alliance partners. He will try to soften his anti-minority image to project himself as a national leader. Oops moment. In a WSJ interview,he said Gujarati women are malnourished as they are more beauty conscious than health conscious. BY THE WAY. Conscious of his hair,he often carries a comb at public events. 3. Sonia Gandhi, 66. Congress president. Rank í12: 2. Why. Even as she is in the process of handing over the baton to Rahul Gandhi,she continues to play a decisive role in the Congress and the government in her capacity as party president and UPA chairperson. Power Punch. Her public support for economic reforms,especially for the decision to allow FDI in multi-brand retail,changed the party<U+0092>s usually diffident approach to economic reforms. Despite tremendous pressure from party leaders in New Delhi and Ranchi,she stalled all attempts to form a coalition government in Jharkhand. What Next. She will ensure a smooth transition of power to the younger generation in the party while taking a backseat gradually. She will,however,continue to play an active role until the general elections. By The Way. Besides Italian,English and Hindi,she is well-versed in Portuguese too. 4. Manmohan Singh, 80. Prime Minister of India. Rank í12: 3. Why. After months of dithering,he sent out a strong message that reforms were back on track. He brought P Chidambaram back to the Finance Ministry,removed Jaipal Reddy from the Petroleum Ministry,cleared FDI in multi-brand retail,and went ahead with the cash-transfer scheme. He has not been as assertive as this since he signed the civil nuclear deal with the US. Power Punch. Moved Chidambaram to Finance Ministry despite several political and legal attacks on the minister,triggering a number of long-pending economic decisions. What Next. A third term as PM not ruled out. Oops moment. His <U+0093>Theek hai?<U+0094> remark at the end of a televised address after the Delhi gang rape prompted a volley of criticism. By The Way. Breakfast hour is when he is most relaxed. That is when he meets most of his non-political guests. 5. P Chidambaram, 67. Minister of Finance. Rank í12: 10. WHY. He pulled back the economy from the prospect of being rated junk by financial markets in just six months. Though Budget 2013-14 was far from the dream budget of 1996-97,it can prove to be a more significant watershed for the Indian economy. POWER PUNCH. India is still growing at just above 5 per cent. The oil subsidy bill has gone down only just,and the target of fiscal consolidation still looks challenging. Yet,since January this year,foreign investors have pumped in $10 billion into the stock markets. A large part of their faith is built on the occupant of the corner room in North Block. WHAT NEXT. Several high-profile appointments,including the next RBI Governor and CAG. The first of the new bank licences is also due this year. BY THE WAY. After his eighth Budget in 2013,he became the top Budget maker in India after Morarji Desai,who presented 10 Budgets. 6. Sushma Swaraj, 61. Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha. Rank í12: 5. Why. Her consent is crucial for the government to get important legislation on economic reforms,Lokpal and land acquisition through the House. Power Punch. While every one else stood in deference to Narendra Modi at the partyís national conclave in March,she said she would begin where Modi left in his speech. What Next. She is in the race for the BJP<U+0092>s prime ministerial candidature. She already has the public support of NDA partner Shiv Sena and might get support from more allies. Oops moment. When she said she would raise an important issue in Parliament: <U+0093>Why is it that attack in films is only on Hindu beliefs and on names like Sita,Radha and Kaushalya?<U+0094> By The Way. She is an ardent follower of Lord Krishna. 7. Arun Jaitley, 60. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha. Rank <U+0091>12: 6. Why. With the UPA government short of a majority in the Rajya Sabha,he holds importance for his stance on important legislative agenda of the government. He is the BCCI vice-president and a member of the IPL governing council. Power Punch. Breaking from practice,he decided to be part of the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha to shape the Lokpal Bill. His contribution in cleaning the government<U+0092>s version to make it more acceptable is widely acknowledged. What Next. He is in the reckoning for the BJPís prime ministerial nomination. His friendship across parties is used by the BJP to avoid disintegration of the NDA,and will come in handy in roping in new allies for the general elections. He is all set to take over as the BCCI president next year. By The Way. He is the only meat-eater among the top six leaders of the BJP. His all-time favourite,however,is Amritsari chana-kulcha. 8. Pranab Mukherjee, 77. President of India. Rank í12: 8. Why. Even though he is no longer in active politics,he remains in the limelight. By shedding colonial honorifics,breaking protocol norms in Rashtrapati Bhavan and rejecting mercy petitions,he has ensured that his relevance in public sphere does not diminish. Power Punch. His decision to reject a number of mercy petitions in the last few months,beginning with that of Ajmal Kasab,has instantly put the focus on Rashtrapati Bhavan. Other clemency pleas that he turned down were those of Afzal Guru and four gang members of sandalwood smuggler Veerappan. What Next. His role becomes critical as soon as general elections are called. Known as the leader who could not become the prime minister,he can find himself in a role to decide who can be the next prime minister. By The Way. He has been writing a diary for the last three decades. 9. Nitish Kumar, 61. Chief Minister,Bihar. Rank í12: 13. WHY. Nitish Kumar is one leader both the Congress and BJP will seek in case of a fractured mandate in 2014. He has made it clear that he is not bound to the NDA. His opposition to Narendra Modi and the impressive growth numbers of Bihar give him a national stature. POWER PUNCH. After he put up a massive show of strength at his first solo rally in Delhi where he demanded special status for Bihar,the Centre is moving to grant that status. WHAT NEXT. If the government is formed by an alliance supported by either the BJP or the Congress after the general elections,Nitish is one of the leaders who can end up as prime minister. Even otherwise,his party,the JD(U),is likely to be a significant member of any ruling alliance. BY THE WAY. He gets a head massage before he starts his day. 10. Mulayam Singh Yadav, 73. Chief of Samajwadi Party. Rank í12: 19. Why. While his son is the CM of Uttar Pradesh,he is the <U+0091>Super CM<U+0092> who chides his son publicly. With his support to the UPA crucial after the DMK<U+0092>s pull-out,he has kept the Congress on tenterhooks. Also,a potential magnet for a possible third front. Power Punch. Though he indicated he would not upset the UPA applecart after his UP victory,he aligned with the mercurial Mamata Banerjee to make the Congress reconsider its presidential candidate and to nominate Pranab Mukherjee. What Next. With the BJP hoping to make gains at the expense of the Congress in the next general elections,he wishes to leverage his advantage in UP to make one last bid for prime ministership by forging a secular alliance.

High cash generation from core businesses is his key strength,which helps his flagship company,RIL,to diversify in several directions. POWER PUNCH. The $390 million Network 18-Eenadu merger deal was the largest Indian media deal,that changed the complexion of the sector. The first clear signs that the gas-flow from the KG-D6 wells is on a revival path has sharply changed the assessment by fund houses of Indiaís largest company by market cap. WHAT NEXT. His foray into telecom with a pact with younger brother,Anil,can be a gamechanger. BY THE WAY. For the last four years,his annual salary remains capped at Rs 15 crore though shareholders have found him eligible for Rs 38.82 crore. 13. Kamal Nath, 66. Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. New on the list. Why. The dealmaker-in-chief has been picked for handling the crucial task of mobilising the requisite numbers in Parliament,whenever needed,and keep the Manmohan Singh government afloat. It is a big challenge at a time when the government has become more dependent than ever on two most unreliable parties,SP and BSP. Power Punch. He delivered a victory for the UPA regime in both Houses over the introduction of FDI in retail even while the Trinamool Congress had joined the opposition ranks to stall the move.

There are seven new names in the top 30 and significant changes in ranking for others,pointing to some major developments over the past 12 months.

969,"The head of the Census Bureau assured an investigative committee of Congress that nobody could falsify data without getting caught ó at the very same time someone was doing just that with the help of Census superiors who seemed to be covering it up. Iíve already written about the case of Julius Buckmon, a Census enumerator (or data collector) who in 2010 was caught fabricating interviews with households. Census, as it does every month, was doing work for the Labor Department, and Buckmon allegedly falsified hundreds of interviews each month. Buckmon, who was working out of the Philadelphia Census office, claimed that superiors told him to fake the interviews. But there was never an investigation by Census of his claims. In fact, the only reason any details emerged was that Buckmon later sued Census and the Commerce Department for racial and age discrimination. And it now appears that Buckmon was never fired. He was simply allowed to disappear from the Census payroll. Buckmonís chicanery took place during the summer of 2010. A source with knowledge of the situation, however, says this sort of behavior has been carried on by other enumerators right up to the present day. The Buckmon matter is now being investigated by the Inspector General at Census, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and the House Oversight Committee. (And, as you know, Iím also looking into it.) The Oversight Committee, in particular, has a bone to pick with Census. In July 2010, Robert Groves ó then director of the Census Bureau ó appeared before the Oversight Committee and said, ìWe also are confident that our quality-control operations will identify instances where enumerator data are falsified or procedures are not being followed.î Remember, this is precisely the time that Buckmon was snagged in Philly faking surveys. Did Groves not know what was going on? Or was he also covering up? Groves and New York Regional Director Tony Farthing were testifying before the Oversight Committee for a reason. At the same time Buckmon was doing his thing, two supervisors in the Brooklyn office of Census were also caught taking shortcuts that corrupted surveys. In the Brooklyn case, the supervisors were messing with the 2010 Census, not the numbers being put together for Labor. Among other things, the Brooklyn office was using a software package called Fast Data ìto obtain information about households they were supposed to be interviewing,î according to Groves testimony to the Oversight Committee. ìThis is deeply troubling; I find it abhorrent to all the principles underlying the work of the Census Bureau,î Groves added. Then why werenít Buckmonís actions in Philly looked into more carefully? Certainly the monthly employment report is the most important economic data provided by the government, especially when the numbers were coming out right before the major 2010 congressional elections. So my point is: Who was in charge of the Philly conspiracy to alter the unemployment rate? And how high up did it go? OK, so the economy started to obviously suck again in December. What are we going to do? We could just continue to watch business conditions languish. Or maybe Washington should finally try my idea ó stimulate the economy through a change in the rules that will allow people to tap into their retirement savings. If we donít come up with something new, five years from now we are still going to be discussing whether or not the economy has recovered from the 2008 recession. As you no doubt know by now, the December employment numbers were awful. But let me say this: I donít trust Laborís statistics when they are upbeat, and I donít trust them when they are downbeat. Hereís a for instance: Labor reported that only 74,000 jobs were created in December. But it also reported that all 74,000 of those jobs and then some went to women. In fact, Table B-5 of last Fridayís news release says that jobs held by women increased to 67.681 million in December from 67.606 million in November ó a 75,000 increase. Seriously? Does anyone really believe a figure like that? I donít know why, but Insurance.com compiled a list of the best songs for driving. The list is topped by Journeyís ìDonít Stop Believing.î Following that was Queenís ìBohemian Rhapsody,î AC/DCís ìYou Shook Me All Night Longî and Tom Cochraneís ìLife Is a Highway.î ìWho Let The Dogs Out,î by The Baha Men was rated the worst. Not so! ìDead Manís Curveî by Jan and Dean has to be the worst driving song ó especially if youíre looking at it from an insurance standpoint. Singer Jan Berry, who died a couple of years ago, suffered brain damage when his Corvette rammed into a truck in Beverly Hills in 1966. Thereís no information about what song he was listening to at the time of the crash.",Trying to make Census of false-info probe | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/13/trying-to-make-census-of-false-info-probe/
970,"Related. The Congress party recently snubbed Union minister Jairam Ramesh for his praise of the AAP forcing him to make a U-turn the next day. It is not often that a close aide of party vice-president Rahul Gandhi gets publicly rapped by the party. Congress sources point to past developments to justify the partyís strong reaction. When the government had been forced to set up a joint committee on Lokpal Bill in 2011, civil society members had proposed Rameshís name on the committee. They had, however, backtracked after the government side contended that they would then also nominate civil societyís representatives on the committee. Eastern Front. Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) chief Babulal Marandi has taken it upon himself to engineer a ìnon-BJP, non-Congressî coalition ahead of the Lok Sabha election. He first met Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee who recently sent Mukul Roy to Ranchi to carry forward talks with the JVM (P) chief. Marandi then met Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The former Jharkhand chief minister now intends to reach out to Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik and AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal. Depending on the success of his efforts to forge what is being dubbed as the ìeastern frontî, Marandi would try to rope in others. The catch, however, is that the former chief minister wants it to be a ìgoodwill coalitionî in which the constituents would not field candidates in one anotherís turf, at least, not in Jharkhand where the prospective allies could help the JVM (P)ís stock among Biharis and Bengalis, among others. Surprise Appointment. Arun Yadavís appointment as Madhya Pradesh Congress chief came as a surprise to many in the party. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had dropped the young Khandwa MP from the Union Council of Ministers in July 2011 on account of non-performance. Yadav had been subsequently appointed AICC secretary but failed to make any mark on the organisational front either. In the recent Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress could win only one out of eight Assembly seats that fall in his parliamentary constituency. The buzz in the Congress circles is that Yadav has benefited from the fact that he is the son of the late Subhash Yadav who had been an arch rival of former chief minister Digvijaya Singh in state.",Delhi confidential:  Jairamís u-turn    | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/delhi-confidential-jairams-u-turn/
971,"Related. With many Union ministers voicing their desire to quit the government and serve the Congress ahead of elections, it has only drawn sarcasm and derision from their party colleagues. With only a few months to go for polls, not many leaders are impressed by these ministersí projected attempt to shun power as poison after enjoying it all these years. A senior Congress functionary pointed out that none of these ministers conveyed such desire to the party high command ahead of any Cabinet reshuffle in the past. HOUSE LOBBY. AROUND 20 senior journalists, who are occupying government flats in Lutyens Delhi, have petitioned to the Urban Development and the Information and Broadcasting ministries to extend their stay in the premises. Many of them have been occupying these houses for over a decade. The UD Ministry is, however, not inclined to oblige them as these accommodations are meant for young budding journalists from modest background who come to the city to make a career. These journalists had earlier petitioned to former I&B minister Ambika Soni and are back to lobbying again. THE CRISIS MAN. INDIAíS new Ambassador to the United States S Jaishankar appears to be the go-to man for the Ministry of External Affairs. As Indiaís Ambassador to China, he managed to end the Depsang intrusion by the Chinese. Then, just a week before his reaching Washington, the Devyani Khobragade case made the headlines.

The topic ó Assessing the Impact of PMís 15 Point Programmeí for Minorities. But many Muslim leaders brought to the commissionís notice that Milad un-Nabi, the Prophetís birthday, is on January 14 after which the NCM had to curtail its meet to a day on Monday.",Delhi Confidential: Little Too Late | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/delhi-confidential-little-too-late/

MATTER OF CHOICE. While Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi wants party general secretaries to quit the posts if they intend to contest Lok Sabha elections, his choice of chairpersons of the screening committees has come as a surprise to many. Several of the chairpersons, including P C Chacko, Jitendra Singh and V Narayanasamy, will be contesting the polls. The question being asked in Congress circles is if Rahul does not think that party general secretaries can do justice to their jobs if they contest elections, how will the screening committee chairpersons do justice to their assignment? This has lent credence to the speculation that the policy for general secretaries and senior AICC functionaries is meant only to ìget rid ofî some of the veterans who do not fit in the young vice-presidentís scheme of things. WOOING VOTES. Desperate to woo the tribal votebank, the UPA government has decided to increase the stipulated days of employment per year under its flagship MGNREGA from 100 to 150 for Scheduled Tribes living in forest areas. It is the Tribal Affairs Ministry under V Kishore Chandra Deo, which had made this proposal and the Rural Development Ministry gave its approval to it earlier this month. Not many in the party are, however, convinced about the electoral efficacy of the MGNREGA. DISCORDANT NOTE WHILE he has formally joined the BJP, former Janata Party chief Subramanian Swamy remains keen to exercise his freedom of speech unmindlful of the thinking in the BJP.

973,"Related. Drinking copious amounts of water, juices, gorging on salads and laxatives, along with enemas, colonic irrigation along with fasts to detox is the new age mantra to get you in shape. The word ëdetoxí is being heard far more often than ever before. Mushrooming spas and fitness centres offer special detox diets and programmes. Promises of ëdetoxí include instant sanitation or cleansing of the system (literally like washing your sins away), weight loss and even magical cures to several ailments. Detoxification refers to treatment protocols designed to help the body, rid itself of waste and toxic materials. The body excretes toxins through various systems including lungs, kidney, skin and colon. The liver is a key factor in detoxification. Its protective enzymes can oxidise and inactivate toxic compounds so that they can be excreted more readily. Some sensitive individuals lack important detoxifying enzymes, which makes them vulnerable to common drugs and toxins. Drinking plenty of water helps the kidney work efficiently to cleanse the blood and to excrete waste products. The average amount needed to make adequate urine are about 2-2 Ω litres and can vary for individuals, seasons and activities. Excessive amounts may not help. Stimulant laxatives can damage nerve cells in the colon wall, decreasing the force of contractions and increasing tendency of constipation. Thus, strong laxatives can be counterproductive. Techniques such as enemas and colonic irrigation have considerable potential for harm. The process can be very uncomfortable, since the presence of the tube can induce severe cramps and pain. If the equipment is not adequately sterilised between treatments, germs from large intestines can be transmitted to others. Fasting to detoxify or lose weight is questionable. While it is prudent to balance out excesses and indulgences on routine days, fasting as a means to detoxify does not really help, especially when fasting is followed by feasting. What really works is adoption of healthy eating and lifestyle practices on a regular basis rather than intermittent fasting and special detox diets practiced for a few days. A good diet should emphasise whole, minimally processed foods with fruits and vegetables and supply adequate antioxidants including vitamin C, E, copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc needed by the bodyís detoxification enzymes to function optimally. Foods like oats, amla, aloe vera, alfa-alfa sprouts, yogurt, garlic, mushrooms along with essential fatty acids may be good choices. The pesticide burden can be reduced by eating organic produce and washing and peeling fruits and vegetables.","Drinking ample water, healthy diet the best ways to detox | The Indian Express",1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food/drinking-ample-water-healthy-diet-the-best-ways-to-detox/
974,"There is a technical term for the Federal Reserveís current predicament. Itís called ìscrewed.î You might remember that the Fed last month reduced the number of bonds and mortgage securities it is purchasing under its disastrous Quantitative Easing program because, it said, the economy was showing improvement. Iím not sure whether the Fed actually believed that or if the few bits of better economic data just gave outgoing Chairman Ben Bernanke the excuse he needed to backpedal on QE. Well, on Friday the whole thing blew up in the Fedís face. And now itís incoming Fed boss Janet Yellenís problem. The Labor Department yesterday announced that only 74,000 jobs were created in December ó and almost all of them were in retail, which isnít a surprise since stores wanted to have plenty of workers on hand to greet the Christmas shoppers who werenít going to show up. Thatís the smallest monthly increase in jobs in three years. And itís way below the 200,000-plus that everyone (including me) thought would be announced. Expectations had even grown since the ADP National Employment Report on Thursday said 238,000 jobs were created by companies in December. There was also ìgoodî news ó at least it is good if you donít fret the details. The nationís unemployment rate in December plunged to 6.7 percent, from 7 percent. But that steep decline came wrapped in a toxic coating. Folks are giving up looking for work. If youíre not looking for work, youíre not unemployed, as far as Labor is concerned. The percentage of people 16 and over who are seeking work or have a job is called the labor participation rate. In December it hit a 35-year low, at 62.8 percent. The Fed meets with Yellen at the helm for the first time on Jan. 28 and 29. Up until Fridayís employment report, the betting on Wall Street was that purchases under QE would be cut more than whatís already been indicated. Scratch that idea. In fact, if Iím right and the January employment report that comes out in February is also nasty, then the Fedís dialogue will change dramatically.",Lousy jobs puts Yellen in bind: Taper or no taper? | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/10/lousy-jobs-puts-yellen-in-bind-taper-or-no-taper/
975,"Over the next few weeks, Congress will interview US Census workers about the falsification of unemployment data. Investigators for the House Oversight Committee, who started the probe of the Census Bureau after a series of reports in this space, have requested that the Commerce Department make at least six census workers from the Philadelphia office available for transcribed interviews. A seventh person, Julius Buckmon, no longer works at Census, which is a unit of the Commerce Dept. It is unclear whether Buckmon, who lost his job as a data collector in 2010 after it was discovered he falsified reports, will voluntarily speak with the House committee. The committee has the power to subpoena witnesses. It will be joined in the probe by the Joint Economic Committee. Census is under contract to collect data for numerous government agencies. The data also are used extensively by economists and private companies for forecasting purposes worldwide. The Current Population Survey is used to calculate the nationís closely watched unemployment rate. That rate is currently at 7 percent and the December figure will be reported by the Labor Department on Friday. Labor collects its own data for the so-called Establishment Survey, which calculates the number of jobs created each month. So that part of Fridayís report could not have been affected by Census. Neither Census nor Commerce investigated the Buckmonís data fabrication scheme in 2010. The incident only got internal attention at the time because Buckmon filed age and race discrimination complaints against Commerce after he was fired. Nothing was ever made public about the Buckmon case and Census never reported it to Labor. The Buckmon incident first became public when it was reported in this space in late November. Since then, Iíve reported there was a second case of falsification in 2010, when two supervisors in the Brooklyn field office were fired. In that case, the Census Bureau contacted Congress, citing the seriousness of the matter. Hereís a key question to preoccupy the Oversight Committee: Why was the Philadelphia incident treated so much differently than the one in Brooklyn? In his complaint against Commerce, Buckmon alleged that higher-ups ordered him to concoct interviews with nonexistent people. Buckmon had been doing 100 or so more interviews a month than other Census workers, a source told me back in November. For his part, Buckmon said he wasnít in a position to know if the supervisor had others in the Philadelphia office fake interviews. Census is now divided into just six regions across the US. So, tainted information coming from any one of these regions could affect the national data if the fraud is relatively widespread. Buckmonís fraud wasnít unique and didnít stop in Philadelphia when he was caught, a source said. In fact, the practice, I was told, continues to the present day. In fact, this sort of cheating even has an informal name ó ìcurbstoning,î for the habit of census workers sitting on the curb and filling out blank interviews themselves. Iím told that Buckmon was assured by a supervisor a couple levels up that heíd be protected from punishment if his actions were discovered. A supervisor, likewise, said someone higher up was protecting him. My source also said it was well understood around the Philadelphia office that the unemployment rate needed to go down right before the last presidential election. And, indeed, the jobless rate did have a significant drop two months before President Obama was returned to office. There is no way for me to know if that decline was complements of Philadelphiaís actions ó or was produced the old-fashioned way, by real people getting real jobs. But Iím pretty sure a little data-mining by Congress can help figure that out. Commerce has disputed everything Iíve alleged and defended its data-collecting practices, characterizing the Buckmon case as an isolated incident. Commerceís Office of the Inspector General is now investigating the incident and any other falsifications that might have occurred in Philadelphia. The OIG has interviewed census workers and is said to be cooperating with Congress. The general counselís office at Commerce may be a different story. Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the Oversight Committee, on Nov. 19 asked for a load of Buckman documents, ìincluding e-mails, between and among Census Bureau employees referring or relating to the collection of the Current Population Survey.î While it has started to produce some documents, Commerce has been slow to comply. ìThe Commerce Department and the Census Bureau have been surprisingly hostile and noncooperative in their responses to basic requests for documents and interviews, considering their public posturing that there is ënothing to see here,íî according to a source close to the committee. Even more interesting, Commerceís general counsel office has suddenly taken a keen interest in the case and has, Iím told, been inundated with questions from outsiders. Hopefully the legal guys at Commerce know enough not to coach the Census employees on what to say to Congress. The investigation also is apparently putting a crimp in the business-as-usual atmosphere in the Philadelphia office, which, according to sources, came up short of the 90 percent response rate that Labor requires of its surveys. While the final response was only fractionally short of 90 percent, even that level was achieved only after the December jobless survey deadline was extended, sources said.",Census doubters suggest curbstoning | New York Post,1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/09/census-doubters-suggest-curbstoning/

This is fair? This is equal justice under the law? The latest offense to our justice system came Tuesday when Dimon agreed to have the bank pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it failed to stop Bernie Madoffís Ponzi scheme.

Did I mention that JPM shares fell 1.1 percent to $58.32, meaning shareholders ó again! ó took it on the chin? JPM was Madoffís bank. And after decades of doing business with the crook, JPM protected itself when it started to get the notion that Madoff was up to no good, court papers revealed on Tuesday. In fact, investigators found that once JPM started believing that Madoffís investment performance was ìtoo good to be true,î it protected the money it had placed with Madoff feeder funds rather than blow the whistle to regulators. Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara was proud Tuesday when he announced the deal with JPMorgan, which comes just months after the bank agreed to pay a $15.7 billion fine to make other regulatory probes go away. JPM is also being investigated for its hiring practices in China. It seems the bank understands that politicians all over the world can be bought. Dimon had better keep his checkbook handy. Another payoff to the US government canít be far away. Bharara has prosecuted a lot of Wall Street misdeeds, but the crooks he has put in the dock have been lower-level miscreants.

When will the high and mighty be brought to justice? Federal Judge Jed Rakoff was addressing the wider conspiracy of inaction when he recently spoke about failure to prosecute those responsible for the 2007 financial meltdown. ìThe failure of the government to bring to justice those responsible for such a massive fraud speaks greatly to weaknesses in our prosecutorial system that needs to be addressed,î the judge said. The Justice Department responded quickly by saying ìno individual or institution is above the law, and we will continue to follow the evidence where it leads to hold the appropriate people and institutions accounting,î said a spokesman for Attorney General Eric Holder.

977,"Later this week the government should announce good jobs growth for the month of December. But that will be followed four weeks later by a report that will likely show very bad job growth in January. As far as Wall Street is concerned this Fridayís good job growth will be a bad thing. But the bad job growth in January (to be announced on Feb. 7) will be considered a good thing. Got all that? Good is bad and bad is good ó unless, of course, someone very high up at the Federal Reserve suggests that good is actually good and bad is actually bad. Let me give you some numbers that will make this all as clear as a chocolate diamond. Wall Street expects the Labor Department to report Friday that 195,000 jobs were created in December. Thatís the financial communityís default guess ó the consensus is always around that amount. It also expects the unemployment rate to remain at 7 percent. But that figure is so ridiculously flawed that I wonít waste any ink or paper discussing it. If the 195,000 job prediction happens to come true, it would represent a slowdown from the growth experienced in November, when 203,000 new jobs were supposedly created in the US. That growth was much better than anyone expected. I say ìsupposedlyî because Iím a natural-born skeptic and because, you might remember, the government was closed for much of the month of October. Perhaps, Iím thinking, Labor didnít get the numbers right in November because it was still feeling the effects of the previous monthís shutdown and the government workersí return to work. Or maybe stores starting hiring their Christmas help earlier than normal. This could also have added to the November employment numbers. And then thereís also the matter, of course, of the investigation into the Census Bureau, which pulls together the numbers for Labor. Census has already been caught in two instances of fabrications. So maybe someone was playing with the November numbers as well. Yet while Fridayís number will be purer, it will also be dangerous for the markets. Hereís why. Job reports for the past two Decembers have been exceptionally strong and deceptive. There were 230,000 new jobs reported in December 2011, followed by 219,000 jobs created in December 2012. Youíd have to go back to December 2010 to find a weak job figure for that month. I know what you are thinking: so what, stores hire lots of workers in December for the holiday season. There should be growth. But Laborís figure are supposed to take these seasonal aberrations into account and smooth out blips like Christmas hiring. My point: because the two previous Decembers had stronger-than-expected growth, this Fridayís number could also come in healthy. Why is that bad? Because the Fed has already started to cut back on its Quantitative Easing (QE) program, the narcotic that has been keeping Wall Street high. A strong number Friday will probably convince Wall Street that the complete end of QE will come faster than its wants. That kind of thinking is likely to change when the January report comes out on Feb. 7. I know thatís a whole month away and Wall Streetís attention span is a nanosecond, but Iím going to give you my ìlong termî view anyway. January is typically a horrible month for job growth. I know, you also think thatís pretty obvious because of the cold weather and the fact that stores lay off holiday workers. But, remember, Labor is supposed to even out these factors when its seasonal adjustments are working properly. The real problem with Januaryís number is that Laborís guesstimate for jobs created by newly formed companies goes decidedly negative for that month. This is called the Birth/Death Model. So with Labor assuming that hundreds of thousands of positions are being lost at small companies each January, itís virtually impossible for job growth in January to be impressive. Here are some examples. For January 2013, only 148,000 jobs were created. In January 2011, just 69,000 new jobs appeared. And in January 2010, there was a loss of 13,000 jobs. Something very strange did happen in January 2012 ó an amazing 311,000 jobs were reported that month. But that just proves miracles do happen! If the January figures reported on Feb. 7 do turn out disappointing, Wall Street will be thrilled. Remember, bad is good because the Fed will be more reluctant to take away Wall Streetís drug of choice ó QE3. All of this is happening at a time when several Fed officials are beginning to say their mea culpas over the effects of QE. Dallas Fed chief Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser over the weekend both seemed to purge their guilty consciences about the stock market bubble that QE is creating. And William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, talked about the mysteries associated with QE. (In other words, Dudley doesnít really know how thisíll all turn out.) With nervous chatter like that coming out of the Fed, Wall Street would like its economic porridge neither too hot nor too cold. Fridayís job figure could be too hot for Wall Street to swallow.","Jobs report: The good, the bad & the schizo | New York Post",1/16/14,http://nypost.com/2014/01/06/jobs-report-the-good-the-bad-the-schizo/
978,"When real estate was hot, he bought a seller-financed house in Austin to use as a rental property, inheriting a property lien that's now $3,600. And he has grownup obligations: He has an 8-year-old son from a previous relationship and pays $720 a month in child support. The good news is that Rodriguez recently received a promotion that pushed his salary from $59,000 to $67,000. In addition, he earns $6,500 annually working as a division petty officer in the Navy Reserve. Eventually he'd like to become a chief strategy officer in his field. He also wants to save more for retirement and his son's college. But he knows the credit card debt is holding him back. THE PROBLEM. One word: debt. Besides the credit cards and property lien, Rodriguez has an $8,100 auto loan, a $73,000 mortgage on his rental property at a 7% interest rate, and a $139,000 mortgage at 6% on a multifamily home (he lives in half of it and rents the other side). Plus, he has only $1,000 saved for emergencies. RODRIGUEZ'S FINANCES. Income: $73,500. Assets: $36,000 in retirement accounts, $1,000 in cash. Goals: Pay off debt; move up in his career. THE ADVICE. Refinance. Rodriguez enjoys being a landlord. His rental income covers three-quarters of the monthly payments on his home loans -- including the one he lives in. After speaking with local mortgage brokers, Austin financial planner Eric Hehman says Rodriguez could drop the rates on his loans to 4.5% and 4%. By then applying the $370-a-month savings to the high-rate debt, he could wipe it out in just over two years. Save more. Post-raise, Rodriguez should hike his 403(b) contribution from 3% to 10% of pay. He can also put $150 a month into his emergency fund and $150 into a 529 college savings plan for his son; once his debt is retired in two years, he can boost that emergency savings even more. Focus on career goals. Rodriguez should reach out to higher-ups in his current organization and broaden his contacts outside his immediate network to include, say, advisory firms that help support chief strategy officers, says Kate Wendleton, president of the Five O'Clock Club, a national career-coaching group.","Financial advice: $15K in credit card debt - Jul. 9, 2012",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/09/pf/financial-advice-debt.moneymag/index.htm
979,"Surgical treatment for sleep†apnea. Summary. The standard treatment for people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is a mask worn at night that helps them breathe without interruption. The mask is unwieldy and uncomfortable, however; one study found that 46 per cent to 83 per cent of patients with obstructive sleep apnea do not wear it diligently. Now scientists may have found an alternative, at least for some patients: a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest that stimulates a nerve in the jaw, helping to keep part of the upper airway open. The device, called a neurostimulator, helped reduce breathing interruptions and raise blood oxygen levels in about two-thirds of sleep apnea patients participating in a trial, researchers reported on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. ìThis is a new paradigm of surgical treatment that seems to effectively control obstructive sleep apnea in selected patients,î said Dr Sean M. Caples, a sleep specialist in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. ìItís very exciting.î Still, Dr Caples, who was not involved in the new study, noted that ìa third of patients were not improved when all was said and done,î even though they were chosen because they were seen as likely to benefit. The new trial was funded by the maker of the device, Inspire Medical Systems. At 22 sites internationally, in 126 patients, doctors surgically implanted a remote-controlled neurostimulator that, activated at night, sends regular electric impulses to a nerve inside the jaw. The impulses cause the tongue to move forward during inhalation, opening the airway. Patients experienced a decline in breathing pauses after using the device for a year, to 9 per hour on average, from 29.3 episodes per hour. The number of dangerous drops in blood oxygen levels also declined, to 7.4 per hour on average, from 25.4 per hour. There was no control group during this phase of the study, however, and other experts said that diet, exercise or other factors may have contributed to the reductions. At a year, only two of 126 patients stopped using their upper airway stimulator at night, and 86 percent reported daily use. But sleep apnea worsened in about 20 patients using the device, though it is unclear why. In the second phase of the study, 46 patients doing well with the stimulators after one year were randomly assigned to either continue with the therapy or have it withdrawn for a week. The therapy-continuation group had little change in the number of breathing pauses per hour or drops in blood oxygen levels. But in the patients from whom the stimulation therapy was withdrawn, the number of such breathing pauses increased sharply, to 25.8 per hour on average from 7.6 per hour. The episodes of blood oxygen level drops rose to 23 per hour on average, from 6 per hour. ìThat rebound was compelling evidence that this device did something for their sleep apnea,î said Dr Christine H. Won.",Surgical treatment for sleep apnea | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/surgical-treatment-for-sleep-apnea/

Young adults who went to work and ate dinner around the same time every day typically slept better and woke up fewer times during the night. They also fell asleep more quickly at bedtime. Yet the exact time people performed daily activities <U+0097> say,eating dinner at 6 pm versus 8 pm <U+0097> had little bearing on how well they slept. <U+0093>For the majority of sleep outcomes,we found that completing activities at a regular time better predicted sleep outcomes than the actual time of day that activities were completed,<U+0094> Natalie Dautovich,a psychologist at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa,said.

981,"Summary. Related. Improvements in healthcare in the past century have led to people living longer and healthier lives. However,this has also resulted in non-communicable diseases,including neuro-degenerative chronic diseases such as Alzheimer<U+0092>s. Alzheimer<U+0092>s is a progressive disease,where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over the years. Symptoms include disturbance of multiple functions,including memory,thinking,orientation,comprehension,calculation,learning capacity,language and judgement. The impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied,and occasionally preceded,by deterioration in emotional control,social behaviour or motivation. According to estimates,the 35.6 million people worldwide living with Alzheimer<U+0092>s will double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050. Not only are the numbers growing,but the age onset is also dropping to as early as 40-50s. The good news is that 50-60 per cent cases can be prevented by simply addressing lifestyle changes. Moreover,since treatments are few and rarely effective,early diagnosis and prevention become all the more important. Diet is paramount. Several studies have indicated encouraging correlations. A strong correlation between between insulin resistance in the brain and Alzheimer<U+0092>s has been found,leading some to now classify Alzheimer<U+0092>s as a <U+0093>type 3 diabetes.<U+0094> According to neurologist Dr David Perlmutter,Alzheimer<U+0092>s is an entirely preventable disease,driven by lifestyle factors such as diet. According to him,a low fat diet and over consumption of carbohydrates are at the heart of the Alzheimer<U+0092>s epidemic. Further,he believes that gluten (the protein in wheat,barley and oats) also makes our gut more permeable,which allows proteins to get into the bloodstream,sensitising the immune system and promoting inflammation and autoimmunity,both of which play a role in the development of Alzheimer<U+0092>s. Interestingly,good fats have also been found to be protective. These include fish oils,avocado,nuts,seeds and virgin coconut oil. Virgin coconut oil has received a great deal of attention with respect to its protective role in preventing Alzheimer<U+0092>s. A study published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging in 2004 showed that after administering coconut oil to Alzheimer<U+0092>s patients,there was a significant improvement in cognitive performance. While more research certainly needs to be done in this area,considering its profound benefits,coconut oil and coconut products can be incorporated into our diets. Coconut oil can be stirred into our soups,breakfast cereals,desserts or salads. Ishi khosla is a former senior nutritionist at Escorts.

982,"Cleaning the mobile germ†warehouse. Summary. Take a look at your mobile device. Do you see oily fingerprints and lint on the touch screen? Dust and crumbs forming particulate frost in the corners? Is that a hair stuck at the screen<U+0092>s edge? Because our electronics are constantly within our grubby grasp,they can get pretty gross. They are taken into public restrooms,handed to runny-nosed toddlers,passed around to share photos and pressed against sweaty skin in gyms. Repeated studies show what accumulates is germy nastiness worse than what is on the bottom of your shoe. <U+0093>That devices can be a source of disease transmission is not a subject of debate anymore,<U+0094> said Dr Dubert Guerrero,an infectious disease specialist at Sanford Health in Fargo,North Dakota,and co-author of a study about the persistence of bacteria on iPads published in November in The American Journal of Infection Control. So it is a good idea to keep your devices clean,not only to keep from getting sick but also to maintain resale value when it<U+0092>s time to upgrade. Derek Meister,a technician for the Geek Squad,American retailer Best Buy<U+0092>s repair and online support service,said. <U+0093>People don<U+0092>t want any marks or grime on their devices. The better the condition,the more like new it is,the more money you get on your trade-in.<U+0094> A word of warning: Cleaning your device can be tricky,since you don<U+0092>t want to damage it and manufacturers don<U+0092>t give you much guidance. It can be done,however,if you<U+0092>re careful and conscientious. Dr Guerrero and his colleagues found that regularly wiping down your device with a moist microfibre cloth was sufficient to eliminate many kinds of common bacteria. More enduring and dangerous bacteria like clostridium difficile (which can cause diarrhoea or even inflammation of the colon) and flu viruses may require a sterilising agent like bleach or alcohol,he said. This is a problem,since Apple on its website officially warns against using <U+0093>window cleaners,household cleaners,aerosol sprays,solvents,alcohol,ammonia or abrasives<U+0094> to clean its products and advises instead to <U+0093>simply wipe the screen with a soft,lint-free cloth to remove oil left by your hands.<U+0094> Other manufacturers offer similar advice or none at all. To clean his own mobile devices, Meister at the Geek Squad said he used a 1:1 ratio of 70 percent isopropyl alcohol and distilled water,which together cost less than $4 at most grocery and drugstores. <U+0093>You want distilled water and purer alcohol so there are fewer chemicals or minerals left behind when the solution evaporates,<U+0094> he said. Fill a spray bottle with the diluted alcohol,lightly moisten a lint-free,preferably microfibre,cloth (no paper towels) and gently wipe down the screen and case. Never spray directly onto the device. To clean corners and around ports,use lint-free foam rather than cotton Q-tips. It<U+0092>s up to you how obsessively you want to clean your mobile devices,but health and electronics experts advise wiping down your mobile device with a moist microfiber cloth at least daily for basic sanitation and upkeep. Like your toothbrush,<U+0093>your mobile device is something you want to clean regularly,<U+0094> said Dr. Guerrero,the infectious disease specialist.

983,"An abnormal stroke†risk. Summary. When a lean,healthy,physically active person has a stroke,seemingly out of the blue,the cause may well be a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation. Such was the fate of Pamela Bolen of Brooklyn,then 67,who said she collapsed last year at home. Luckily,her husband,Jack,heard her fall,called an ambulance,and within minutes she was at New York Methodist Hospital. There she was given the drug tissue plasminogen activator,or tPA,to dissolve the clot that was blocking circulation in her brain. The treatment spared her lasting disability. <U+0093>I had high blood pressure which was completely controlled with medication,but I didn<U+0092>t know I had atrial fibrillation until I had a stroke,<U+0094> Bolen said in an interview. The condition slows blood flow from the heart and was the likely cause of the clot that resulted in her stroke. About three million Americans have atrial fibrillation,characterised by multiple irregular electrical signals that cause the heart<U+0092>s upper chambers,the atria,to contract rapidly,without their usual coordination. This sends an erratic signal to the ventricles,the lower chambers that supply blood to the lungs and rest of the body. People with the disorder face a much higher risk of stroke,and most require treatment to prevent this potentially crippling and sometimes fatal consequence. <U+0093>As many as one in five or six strokes is due to atrial fibrillation,and in a lot of these people the rhythm disorder was undetected before the stroke,<U+0094> said Dr. Christian T. Ruff,cardiologist at Brigham and Women<U+0092>s Hospital in Boston,who studies new treatments for the disorder. People with symptomatic A-fib,as it is commonly called,may experience periodic palpitations (a sense that the heart is pounding or fluttering),chest discomfort,shortness of breath,unusual fatigue or dizziness. A-fib can show up during an electrocardiogram,or EKG,but because the abnormal rhythm may not occur all the time,people suspected of having the condition usually must wear a Holter monitor for days or weeks to obtain a certain diagnosis. This small portable device,connected to electrodes on the chest,continuously records the heart<U+0092>s rhythm and sends the data to a doctor or company for evaluation. A-fib is more common in men,tall people and the elderly. As the population ages,the incidence is rising; more than 460,000 new cases are diagnosed annually,a number expected to double in the next 25 years. The condition is also becoming more prevalent at any age,experts say,because of a rise in three leading risk factors <U+0097> high blood pressure,diabetes and obesity. These conditions can damage the heart<U+0092>s electrical system,Dr. Ruff wrote last year in the journal Circulation. Other risk factors include a prior heart attack,overactive thyroid,sleep apnea,excessive alcohol consumption,abnormal heart valves,lung disease and congenital heart defects. Researchers at the University of California,San Francisco,reported this month in Annals of Internal Medicine that people with a high rate of premature atrial contractions,which can be detected by a Holter monitor worn for 24 hours,face a significantly increased risk of developing A-fib. Dr. Gregory M. Marcus,the senior author and director of clinical research at U.C.S.F.<U+0092>s cardiology division,theorized that eradicating these premature contractions with drugs or a procedure that destroys the malfunctioning area of the heart may reduce the risk of the rhythm disorder. Step 1 in treating A-fib is to identify and correct reversible risk factors. Step 2 <U+0097> and most important,according to Dr. Ruff <U+0097> is to prevent blood clots from forming by treating patients with anticoagulants. The most commonly prescribed and least costly treatment is warfarin,also known by the brand name Coumadin,in use for more than half a century. But while highly effective at reducing the risk of stroke,warfarin is a very tricky drug. It interacts with a number of foods,especially those like spinach and kale that are rich in vitamin K,and other drugs that a patient may have to take. People metabolise warfarin at different rates,making it necessary to repeatedly check a patient<U+0092>s clotting ability to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding while maintaining an effective anticoagulant level. Dr. Ruff said that more than half of A-fib patients were either not on an anticoagulant or on an ineffective dose. Fearful of a hemorrhage in the brain,or uncontrolled bleeding in an accident or emergency surgery,doctors may prescribe an amount of warfarin insufficient to prevent a stroke,he said. Last year,Dr. Sanjiv Narayan,an electrophysiologist at the University of California,San Diego,and co-authors described a way to more accurately identify the electrical <U+0093>hot spots<U+0094> in the heart responsible for an abnormal rhythm. Ablating those regions was nearly twice as effective as the standard approach to eliminating atrial fibrillation with ablation,the team reported in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology. But even when all traces of A-fib are eliminated,Dr. Ruff said,continued treatment with an anticoagulant is needed to guard against stroke. <U+0093>Once a person has had A-fib,there is an increased risk of stroke even if their heart is in normal rhythm,<U+0094> he said.",An abnormal stroke risk | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/an-abnormal-stroke-risk/

That he is too weak to deliver a cartful of goodies to his country<U+0092>s latest <U+0093>strategic ally<U+0094>. That he is coming not so much as the most powerful leader in the world,but mostly as a seeker of jobs for his recession-hit people. All three are probably right. But is it all good,or bad for India? Could it be that this visit won<U+0092>t be a game-changer because there is no need to materially alter the relationship as it has been re-set in the past 15 years? This visit,then,would be further evidence that the game of our bilateral relationship has already changed. Therefore,it is about cementing and celebrating that remarkable shift rather than search for unnecessary new paradigms. Clinton convinced us after 37 years (since Kennedy,1963) that Americans could be our friends. By declaring that the map of the subcontinent can no longer be redrawn in blood he also sanctified the LoC as a nearly de-facto border. Bush followed by seeking India as a strategic partner in the war against terror and backing his commitment by delivering to India an unprecedented single-country exemption from such a water-tight regime of multilateral treaty restrictions. These moves were game-changers. These were made between two different sets of governments in the 1998-2008 decade,thereby also acquiring a genuinely bipartisan seal of approval in both democracies. Our engagement with the US from thereon,should be,and is about consummating the gains from this. That is what this Obama visit should,and hopefully will,be about. Meanwhile,we have to get over our terminal disease of trivialising issues,and undermining our own new status in a world where balance of power has been altered by not just the end of the Cold War,but also the Great Recession of 2008. The first marked the end of one super power,the second left the remaining super-power greatly diminished,its people living with pessimism,fear and ideological polarisation not experienced by two generations. Obama lands in New Delhi as the leader of that America. The visit already had a near-false start as we let a trivial issue of outsourcing and visa fees dominate the build-up. As also,Obama<U+0092>s candid view on India<U+0092>s permanent membership of the UN Security Council. The first is a matter of run-of-the-mill trade negotiations. It<U+0092>s an aside but relevant today: in Washington in 1987,Reagan picked up a cashew from the table,and reminded Rajiv Gandhi that it had come from India,and when would his country start buying Californian almonds. From squabbling over serious,strategic differences and insecurities,our relationship has matured so much we now only argue over whether our intelligence people share all the information they have,or only 80-90 per cent (as with Headley). On arms supplies,nobody goes neurotic with every new shipment to Pakistan and we talk,instead,about what we can buy,and only if the terms are better than offers from Europe,Israel and Russia. And on trade,instead of arguing over sundry tree nuts,we are negotiating tens of billions of dollars in trade. Indian and American leaders have invested three decades in de-hyphenating our relationship. That achieved,the logical next step should be a relationship of equality,of give-and-take,rather than giver-and-taker. By continuing to harp on jobs and exports,Obama is underlining the changed nature of of our relationship.

986,"SolarCity wants you to buy its debt. Solar panel company SolarCity plans to sell debt directly to individuals via a new web-based platform. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) SolarCity wants to give investors more exposure to the sun. In a unique move, the solar panel company revealed a plan Wednesday to sell debt investments directly to individual investors. Previously, such bond-like products were only available to large institutional investors. Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) last year announced a deal to provide the firm with $500 million in financing for example. ""People want to support clean energy development,"" SolarCity ( SCTY ) CEO Lyndon Rive said in a statement. ""Customers are seeing the benefits of getting solar for their homes but they would like to participate in other ways as well."" SolarCity will launch a new online investment platform for investors to buy and sell the debt. The clean energy firm, which operates in 14 states, said the products will be backed by a pool of solar assets, namely the 20-year solar panel leases it signs with its customers. ""Those contracts produce a long-term, predictable source of cash flow,"" said Tim Newell, vice president of financial products for SolarCity in an interview with CNNMoney. SolarCity offers solar-power systems for homes, businesses and other organizations, designing and installing custom-built arrangements. Customers can get solar panels installed with no upfront costs and then pay SolarCity each month for power. The investments will be similar to mortgage-backed securities in the sense that returns rely on payments from SolarCity's customers. Newell said SolarCity is adopting to technological changes in the financial markets, such as the fact that some municipal bonds can be purchased online. ""You're seeing the growth of direct investment platforms throughout the investment industry,"" he said. ""We're taking those changes and applying them to the solar industry."" Newell added that SolarCity plans to sell a range of debt products with different durations and yields and that the investment platform should go live sometime in the first half of this year. But Guy LeBas, a fixed-income strategist with Janney Capital Investments, said such offerings at the corporate level are still rare. One reason, according to LeBas, is that investment banks usually serve as intermediaries in debt issuance. These big financial institutions can help with price setting, marketing, and navigating the regulatory landscape. He added that it's ""very hard"" to raise a big amount of money with offers directly to investors. Still, SolarCity is hoping its position as an up and coming green technology company will energize investors.

When they wanted steadier jobs, they dived into new fields: Carson works in trading and operations for an energy company; DeLallo, an editorial specialist at a financial services consulting firm, is pursuing her MBA. Married in 2008, they now have financial security -- they earn $225,000 a year and have almost half a million in savings -- and a new passion: the markets. ""We like to read through the news and see if we can find an upcoming trend,"" Carson says. Trouble is, their enthusiasm is getting the better of them. Both have sprawling portfolios of individual stocks, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds that are proving hard to manage -- nearly 50 separate investments in total. ""I had a lot more time to pay attention to my investments a year or two ago,"" says DeLallo. Moreover, they've seen the downside of market timing: In 2008, believing property values had hit bottom, they bought their house for $508,000. Today the four-bedroom is worth only about $380,000 and also needs some repairs. The two women also tend to gravitate toward what's trendy or talked about by CNBC's Jim Cramer. They own gold ETFs, energy companies, and familiar brands such as Lululemon ( LULU ) and Starbucks ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ), but have little exposure to key assets such as bonds and international equities. Having many investments means a lot of overlap: They have a big stake in Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ), for example, but also own an ETF in which Apple is the largest holding. Finally, they have a 12-year age gap. So while the older Carson needs to temper risk, DeLallo still needs high growth. DELALLO AND CARSON'S FINANCES. Income: $225,000. Assets: $400,000 in retirement savings, $54,000 in cash. Goals: Invest for their age gap; decide whether to sell their home. THE ADVICE. Diversify -- and pare down. Carson and DeLallo are good savers; they both will max out their employers' 401(k) plans this year, and DeLallo has a Roth IRA. Given that, an overall blend of 60% stocks and 40% bonds should let their savings grow sufficiently to support them in retirement, without as much volatility as their present mix of 77% stocks and 23% bonds and cash, says McChesney. She also suggests they swap most of their individual stock holdings for funds; they can do so without triggering a big tax bill, since the vast majority of the couple's money is in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Minimize performance chasing. Carson and DeLallo don't want to give up researching stocks. ""We want to have some room to jump on opportunities when we find them,"" DeLallo says. That's fine, McChesney says, as long as they keep stock picks to 10% or less of their portfolio. Wait out the real estate market -- or not. Home values in Stamford have declined as much as 35% since the top of the market, says Geri Guzinski, a local realtor, and aren't expected to turn around soon.","Financial advice: Reining in their stock portfolio - Jul. 9, 2012",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/09/pf/financial-advice-stock-portfolio.moneymag/index.htm
988,"They're juggling three homes: their own and two they bought for their son, 18, and daughter, 21, to live in during college. They also supply meals and run errands for Mike's 92-year-old father, taking him twice weekly to see Mike's mom, who has Alzheimer's, in a nursing home 50 miles away. All that, plus their jobs. The couple commute an hour each way to work: Jo Ann has a $52,000-a-year position as a high school English teacher; Mike, a retired Army reservist and financial analyst at HUD, the U.S. housing agency, now works part-time as a security guard. That leaves little time to enjoy their lakefront home. The couple would like to stop working in six years when Jo Ann marks 20 years in Florida's public school system. Though they have only $93,000 in Roth IRAs, the Nahirnys have two factors working in their favor: a habit of careful budgeting and a generous amount of guaranteed income. Mike gets $34,000 a year from his HUD pension and in two years will add $6,000 a year from a U.S. Army Reserves pension. Another $9,600 comes from a fixed annuity they bought after their savings dropped 22% in the financial crisis. Six years from now, that $50,000 or so of guaranteed income would be less than half their current intake. Jo Ann will have a pension, though she can't tap it -- or Social Security -- until age 62. (Mike won't collect Social Security from his government job.) THE NAHIRNY'S FINANCES. Income: $112,000. Assets: $93,000 in IRAs, $25,000 in cash; $44,000 in pension and annuity. Goal: Retire in six years. THE ADVICE. Pay off the home loans. The Nahirnys are paying nearly 7% interest on their $35,000 home-equity credit line and the $30,000 mortgage on a house their daughter lives in. Rather than fully funding their Roth IRAs, Jacksonville financial planner Carolyn McClanahan advises them to use the next three years of contributions to pay off what's left of the loans. That strategy makes sense, she says, because their loans are too small to refinance and don't offer tax benefits (it's not worth it for them to itemize). Paying them off will provide a guaranteed return and eliminate $900 a month in debt payments just as they hit retirement. Plus, after their children graduate, the couple plan to rent both homes, bringing in an estimated $1,000 a month after expenses. Lower investment costs. The Nahirnys' Roth IRAs are in actively managed funds with an average 1.1% expense ratio. Switching to exchange-traded funds will give them almost an extra percentage point of return a year, McClanahan says. She recommends putting 75% of their money in the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF ( VT ) and splitting the rest between an intermediate-term corporate bond ETF and Vanguard Total Bond Market ( BND ). That's a lot of stocks for near retirees, but their guaranteed income allows them to take more risk, and if stocks have a good run, they'll get to enjoy the extra funds. Plan for long-term care. Mike's family has a history of longevity -- and Alzheimer's. An ongoing stay in a facility would demolish their IRAs quickly. Tampa insurance consultant Mark Maurer says a long-term care insurance policy covering $200 a day in care (just under the current cost of a Florida nursing home) for three years, adjusted for 3% a year inflation, will run them $2,538 annually. How they can boost returns. By cutting expenses -- from 1.1% to 0.13% -- and taking some extra risk, the Nahirnys could see as much as a two-percentage-point gain in their savings over the long term.","Financial advice: 6 years to retirement, tons of expenses - Jul. 9, 2012",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/09/retirement/financial-advice.moneymag/index.htm
989,"For many years Stefanie worked part-time as a personal trainer. Now Kimberlee, 17, plans to go to James Madison University in Virginia this fall, where costs top $30,000 a year; high school sophomore Celine, 16, has pinned her hopes on going out of state too. The Fuccis have already co-signed $14,000 worth of private loans to pay for 21-year-old Brittany to attend New York's Fashion Institute of Technology (she also has $14,000 in federal Stafford loans). Still, they are determined to let their kids go to their dream schools. ""Out of state goes against our plans, but it's the right fit for Kimberlee,"" says Stefanie. Helping out is Stefanie's second part-time job as a pharmacy technician and Robert's new position as a vice president at a regional bank. That will boost their household income from about $100,000 to $130,000. Brittany also works part-time and moved back home last year, reducing her nontuition expenses to $7,000 a year. THE PROBLEM. The Fuccis have only $35,000 set aside for the girls' college, divided into three custodial savings (UTMA) accounts. Robert wants to use $10,000 of a $75,000 lump-sum pension from an old job to help finance Kimberlee's freshman year. He'll put the rest into an IRA. The Fuccis are also behind on retirement savings, says New York City financial planner Annette Clearwaters. As a part-timer, Stefanie doesn't qualify for her employer's 401(k). When Robert becomes eligible to fund a 401(k) later this year, he plans to start with a 3% contribution, a rate that will leave the couple well short of the amount they'll need to hit their goal of retiring at 70 and 65, respectively, says Clearwaters. They're also trying to pay off a $40,000 home-equity loan and $10,000 in credit card debt that they racked up paying for a vacation and getting a new boiler. Make retirement a priority. Robert should contribute at least 6% of his income when he opens his 401(k). That extra 3% will reduce his income just $2,700 a year but give him the full company match. Stefanie should put the $5,000 max into a Roth IRA. Get savvy about financial aid. The Fuccis should spend the money in the UTMAs instead of pension funds, since money in a child's name is counted heavily in financial aid formulas, says Kal Chany, president of Campus Consultants, which advises families on financial aid . The couple are also eligible for a $2,500 education tax credit for each child. Public universities reserve most of their aid for in-state students, says Chany, so the Fuccis are looking at taking out big loans for Kimberlee's tuition. Kimberlee can cut her expenses, however, by being a resident adviser at her dorm next year; she'll also get a part-time job. Finally, if Celine wants to go out of state, she should apply to private colleges where her grades (she's an A student) and standardized test scores exceed the average for attendees. ""Privates are more generous with grants,"" says Chany. But ""being aggressive doesn't mean putting all your eggs in one basket,"" says Clearwaters, who recommends a 70% stock/30% bond allocation for the retirement money, with no more than 5% in company stock, and suggests that they move the girls' UTMA funds to a low-risk bond or money-market fund. A small contribution adds up. If Robert doubles what he puts in his 401(k), the Fuccis can reduce their risk and still come out ahead. Robert currently contributes 3% of his income to his 401(k). If he continues at that rate, the Fucci's $212,000 in retirement savings is estimated to grow to $614,000 over the course of 12 years. But if Robert doubles his contribution to 6%, that same portfolio is expected to swell to $715,030.","Financial advice: 3 college tuition bills with $35,000 saved - Jul. 9, 2012",1/16/14,http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/09/pf/college/financial-advice.moneymag/index.htm
990,"Summary. Related. In a news discussion on Pakistan earlier this week,NDTV<U+0092>s Prannoy Roy asked me,with a mix of exasperation and longing,if it would be possible some day for India to leave Pakistan behind (aside?) and carry on? The cause for exasperation that particular evening was the Pakistan government<U+0092>s declaration in their national assembly that they had banned Jamat-ud-Dawa <U+0097> while the organisation continued with its activities brazenly and its chief had been freed just the other day. Longing,because if only India were to be rid of that deadly distraction that hobbles it at every step,it would be so much better placed to leverage its many newfound strengths. Now,at a pinch you can even shake away the burdens of history. But geography? Can you ever escape that? Can an entire nation collect green cards or H-1Bs or whatever and migrate some place far,far away? While it is a simple enough truism that you cannot choose your neighbours,our most difficult neighbour is also a product of recent,bitter history. It makes it that much more challenging for an Indian leadership to <U+0093>leave it behind<U+0094> or <U+0093>aside<U+0094>. Pakistan can be neither our Canada (there is far too much historical baggage),nor Mexico because that kind of disparity is just not there. Yet,somehow India<U+0092>s leaders must find a way now to peel away. We have invested a whole decade of foreign policy effort to get the Americans to de-hyphenate their India policy. Are we now capable of de-hyphenating our own foreign policy from Pakistan? Can we think creatively enough to even move in that direction? I use the expression <U+0093>creative thinking<U+0094> because for so long now our immediate reflexes and even policy responses have come to be governed by the same hostility and insecurity that block any new thinking. If you look at how similar conflicts have been resolved in the recent past,the most interesting example is the Camp David. Accords that ended the conflict between Israel and Egypt. That one agreement ended the possibility of an all-out war for ever in the Middle East,and it came within a decade marked by two all-out wars and several smaller ones. The essential feature of the settlement that resulted in Egypt recognising Israel,which in turn returned the Sinai desert,was that the Americans pretty much back-stopped it entirely,Israel<U+0092>s security was under-written,and Egypt<U+0092>s armed forces were promised <U+0097> and given <U+0097> all the toys they wanted but on the condition that they were going to be of no nuisance to Israel. Could a customised variant of this ever work in the Subcontinent? I raised that question in a tiny group that Colin Powell met on one of his visits as secretary of state. Probably sufficient time has passed now to recount parts of that conversation. He was discussing likely ways to a solution and I asked if an Egypt-type approach may work for Pakistan. One of his senior aides piped in to ask how such a thing would ever work when the moment the US even offered Pakistan as little as a replacement for a damaged F-16 undercarriage <U+0093>you Indians go ballistic<U+0094>. He also said that even on that visit (in the course of Op Parakram) <U+0093>the Indians only talk to us about five LeT guys who were caught infiltrating last week<U+0094> rather than engage on what to do with Pakistan. But Powell was more patient,willing to engage in what he thought was <U+0093>an interesting yarn<U+0094>. <U+0093>I am new to your region,<U+0094> he said,self-effacingly. <U+0093>But Musharraf as SadatÖ that might be something to think about. But your situation isn<U+0092>t more complicated than the Middle East in the seventies.<U+0094> I said I wasn<U+0092>t so sure because I did not know enough on the Camp David Accords,but asked,somewhat wickedly,that now that his government had embarked upon some kind of a <U+0093>Project Musharraf<U+0094>,did they have a Hosni Mubarak parked in some closet just in case Musharraf disappeared from the scene like Sadat? Powell was still game. <U+0093>That is a very good line,sir,and I will use it in Washington,DC many times,<U+0094> he said,and then added after a long,mischievous grin: <U+0093>And you can be sure that you shall be given no credit for it.<U+0094> It is by now evident that Washington<U+0092>s <U+0093>Project Musharraf<U+0094> was indeed a variant of the old Project Sadat. And the graduated movement towards some kind of a permanent solution with India,marked by the Islamabad Declaration with Vajpayee,then Manmohan Singh and back-channel diplomacy led on the Indian side by Satinder Lambah,was linked with this. It also failed so close to the finishing line because fate took Musharraf away from power. Not through an assassin<U+0092>s bullet,but through his own political stupidity and big-mouth arrogance. And when he went away,particularly the way he went away,swept aside by a democratic upsurge,there wasn<U+0092>t a Hosni to be ushered out. of the closet. It ended in failure,but it was the last,and so far the most creative shot at an agreement that would have enabled us to move on,leaving Pakistan behind,aside. Or,in a more perfect world,even taking it along as a partner,not adversary. How close that process,sustained through a government change in India,came to a breakthrough is the best reason why original thinking should not be discarded as we move on,and through many setbacks,perfidies and betrayals. We can<U+0092>t go into a shell every time Hafeez Saeed appears in public even as we press for his prosecution. Saeed and the many Lashkars are not the problem. They are a symptom,or even an instrument. The basic problem is the virus that sits embedded in the mind of the Pakistani military-intelligence- bureaucratic establishment. It has built and nurtured the Lashkars as a strategic asset to keep India off-balance in <U+0093>peace<U+0094> time,and to be a force multiplier in war. No matter what their assurances,they will not give up on that asset until they are fully dissuaded,or persuaded,that India is no longer either a military threat or opportunity. India has to engage with the rest of the world in the search for that new creative solution which may,ultimately,be a variant of the earlier one,except that Pakistan now does not have a Musharraf equivalent. That,in fact,is all the more reason why a new settlement,if it were to be achieved,must be backed by some kind of international or big-power guarantees. It will be tough,but not impossible. No nation of India<U+0092>s size that wishes to rise to its true potential can do so with almost all its borders unsettled. It is now evident that the Chinese won<U+0092>t settle with us as long as the Pakistanis don<U+0092>t,and give them the opportunity to play balance-of-power. Similarly,Pakistan will continue using China to play its own balance-of-power with us. The first step for us to break out of this triangulation is to find peace with Pakistan,and that can only happen with the Americans not merely leaning heavily,but even under-writing some Egypt-like arrangement to change the very nature of Pakistani society and establishment. That is how we can de-hyphenate ourselves from our geography,and even some history.",A new Project Pakistan | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/a-new-project-pakistan/
991,"Summary. Related. Two things over the past two weeks underline for us one of the most chronic ailments of the modern Indian mind: a fear of speed,and of scale. The prime minister talked of a 100-day agenda for his new government and Kapil Sibal was the first off the block. Almost nobody substantively disagrees with the broad thrust of his reform in education. But the reaction that cut across both the political and intellectual classes was the same,giddy nervousness: Kapil is going too fast,in India things move slowly. Kapil,of course,is unfazed and responded,in an interview with me on NDTV<U+0092>s Walk the Talk,by asserting that he was,in fact,18 years too late already. And that education reforms should have begun simultaneously with those in the economy in 1991. But as he goes along,he will have to fight the same doubts even among the believers. Because that is how we Indians have become,not merely over centuries of deprivation and calamities,but also through six decades of licence-quota-limit-everything socialist toxification. The second evidence of the same widespread mental illness came in reactions to the Metro accident in South Delhi that claimed six lives. From newspaper columnists to TV channel talking heads to anchors who panicked as if another 26/11 had struck us,the <U+0093>doubt<U+0094> was the same: Sreedharan is wonderful,but is he going too fast? Is the Metro team under too much pressure to finish the project before the Commonwealth Games? Even Sreedharan<U+0092>s assertion that he was six months ahead of schedule anyway,and would have no problem delivering on time in spite of this setback,was greeted with further panic. Why was the man not showing some <U+0093>humility<U+0094> and slowing down? Must he continue to risk the lives of workers? This in a system that is so forgiving of railways that move slowly,completing every project in double the scheduled time if not more (look at the Jammu-Srinagar rail link,for example),while still consuming hundreds of lives every year in completely ridiculous and avoidable accidents. Or,in fact,our view could be,thank God,our trains run so slowly,or so many more would die in these accidents! This also in a system where a tiny sea-bridge that took twice the scheduled time and three times the initial cost to be half-complete can still draw the entire political class to inaugurate it and celebrate it as a marvel of Indian engineering. In a more questioning system,somebody would have been working instead to figure out what kind of obstructions caused this. delay and cost over-run and how to avoid these in future. In a more normal society,you would have wrapped a Sreedharan,who has that rare gift of completing projects in India ahead of time,in cottonwool,and tried to preserve him for ever. Here,instead,we are worrying about how and why he has apparently not set up a succession. Young Mr Lovely,Delhi<U+0092>s transport minister,wants to start looking at Metro safety while his own machinery makes light of killing the odd guy even on his half-done-for-ever BRT corridor which,in engineering terms,is nothing but the laying of a few clumsy barriers and pavements. The history of building a new,independent India,unfortunately,is a history of delays,cost over-runs,inefficiency,corruption and obstructionism,whether it comes to roads,bridges,railways,airports,schools and colleges,hospitals,whatever. Over the decades,we have convinced ourselves,as a society,that schedules are just for the heck of it,<U+0093>naam ka vaaste<U+0094>,because the realities of life will make it impossible to stick to them. Because nobody wants to believe the system can be changed,we have also acquired a kind of Stockholm Syndrome,feeling comfortable and secure in being held hostage by it. Go to the National Highway Authority website and check the list of projects delayed by more than a year and you will be astounded not by how many sections are running that late,but by how blasÈ that bureaucracy has become about it. An even nastier sibling of our fear of speed is our repudiation of scale. Through the decades,our entire politico-bureaucratic-intellectual system has worked to <U+0093>control<U+0094> scale going <U+0093>out of control<U+0094>. This is what provided the intellectual basis of the licence-quota raj: because every resource,particularly capital,was scarce,it was imperative that we <U+0093>controlled<U+0094> how anybody invested/ expended it. The 1991 crisis liberated industry from that curse and see how wonderfully and gloriously it has responded and prospered,helping drive rejuvenating change across the country. But much else is still bedevilled by the same thinking. So we will first build a two-lane road because we are afraid a six-lane one will be <U+0093>too much<U+0094> given <U+0093>traffic projections<U+0094>. Then,it will be completed three years late,and be choc-a-bloc on the day of its inauguration. Six months later,you will start thinking of four-laning it,and by the time that is completed,and is overloaded,you will plan two more lanes. As a result,we still remain in a constant spiral of construction and under-delivery. The same applies to our railways,airports,schools and colleges. We always plan for today,deliver day-after-tomorrow,and are condemned to live with permanent shortages. In both practical and philosophical terms,this is comparable with our self-inflicted shortages of scooters,telephones and LPG connections in the past. The fear of scale,at least until the recent past,was exemplified by many leading lights in the Planning Commission who invested so much emotion,energy and time in scaling back plans and projects that it should have been renamed <U+0093>Underplanning<U+0094> Commission. Admitted,we can<U+0092>t always hope to match the Chinese obsession with scale and speed,and the belief in the principle of <U+0093>If you build it,they (users) will come.<U+0094> But we have internalised the whole idea of <U+0093>hastening slowly<U+0094> as a core national belief,possibly drawing inspiration from our romantic poetry,even film songs that always counsel patience over speed: <U+0093>Babuji zara dheere chalo<U+0094> (Dum),<U+0093>Haule-haule ho jaayega pyar<U+0094> (Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi) and that evergreen favourite of three generations,Geeta Dutt<U+0092>s <U+0093>Babuji dheere chalna<U+0094> from the <U+0092>60s Aar Paar. You just tweak the next line a bit replacing <U+0093>pyaar<U+0094> with <U+0093>sarkar<U+0094> and you get the most fitting anthem for our system: Babuji dheere chalna,sarkar mein,zara sambhalna. Because if you move slowly,you take no risks at all. There are enough elements in India for you. to justify delays and,in any case,excuse-mongering is our most prized national tribute. It is only if you break that rule,try to finish things on schedule,or dream big,that you run the risk of going wrong. That,if you are in this mai-baap sarkar system,is just not worth it. Even our folklore,our traditional,even Sufi,wisdom passed down generations pleads only eternal patience,as in Bhakt Kabir<U+0092>s <U+0093>Dheere,dheere re mana dheere sab kuchh hoye (Be patient my heart,everything will happen,but slowly,slowly).<U+0094> Even in our popular culture,the honest,efficient and sincere are stray romantics and,ultimately,losers; a trend you see in the defining movies of each decade. There is a sense of resignation,an acceptance of the inevitability of misery,under-performance,shortages,delays,waste and corruption. Only,it is unsustainable at a time when our people are getting younger,more questioning,demanding and impatient. One way or the other,they will refuse to live with this contradiction between what they want and expect and what the system feels comfortable delivering. They will either force a change,or vote with their feet.",Babuji dheere chalna | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/babuji-dheere-chalna/
992,"Related. There are winners and there are losers in any election. But this is one election India can feel particularly good about. Not only because it<U+0092>s been one of our smoothest ever <U+0097> for which the Election Commission deserves the nation<U+0092>s gratitude <U+0097> but also because it confirms the positive trends that some of us,incorrigible optimists,have been flagging for a while. This newspaper has argued that the politics of grievance,rooted in our complex past,is giving way to the politics of aspiration. Or,as Thomas Friedman puts it,the weight of dreams is turning out heavier than that of memories. This election,powered by 60 crore voters,shows our democracy is firmly on that virtuous curve. For,anybody who built a campaign on negativism,prejudice,victimhood and vengeance has been demolished. The voter has,in fact,been even less forgiving with victims of hubris,with those who loftily announce themselves as <U+0093>next<U+0094> Prime Ministers without being sure of even 40 seats; those who build their own statues; and those who with a fraction of seats in Parliament aspire to control the nation<U+0092>s foreign and economic policies without,of course,being accountable for anything. The Indian voter has always rejected arrogance and pomposity but has sometimes been forgiving to those with whom she might have found affinity of caste,religion or ethnicity. By jettisoning even that,the voter has shown new maturity. This didn<U+0092>t happen overnight. Over the past five years,we saw the voter increasingly reject the spoilers,the rent-seekers. This election reaffirms that trend <U+0097> and vindicates the faith in those who deliver. There are other shifts,some stunning,some subtle. This will be India<U+0092>s first post-1991 secular government elected without any help from the Left and in spite of its bitter opposition. So the voter has also junked the idea that Indian secularism needs certificates of legitimacy from the Left. Or that,somehow,you had to be godless to be secular. Such a ringing endorsement of incumbency also busts the myth that an angry voter throws out everybody. A mature,aspirational one thinks coolly and rewards good performance. You see that across states: the Congress scripts a brilliant revival in Uttar Pradesh but has its poorest score for any state in next-door Bihar where Nitish Kumar runs its first decent government in three decades. Similarly,nobody is swayed so easily by abuse and innuendo,particularly when directed at a leader seen as decent,honest,modest and well-meaning. The BJP erred grievously in making a man like Dr Manmohan Singh the main target of its attack,for being <U+0093>weak and ineffectual,<U+0094> because it was contra-factual <U+0097> and the voter had the equanimity to judge that. On the contrary,in this environment of insecurity,with terror attacks and job losses,India has shown that it finds greater comfort with a leader,mature and understated. His party now stands by him and its leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been wise extending to him the respect and trust he so richly deserves. Having risked his head on his instinct twice,on economic reforms in 1991 and the nuclear deal in 2008,Dr Singh will now feel the burden of high expectations. This mandate is such it leaves you no excuses. A final word about L K Advani,one of the last of the great long marchers of our politics,who once again finds himself on the wrong side of history. He has shown admirable grace in defeat and can have the satisfaction that he played a key role in bringing to Indian politics something it needed so badly <U+0097> a centre of gravity which,as this newspaper has argued,can only be found if the Congress and the BJP together have at least 325-350 seats so that rent-seekers can<U+0092>t hold governance to ransom. That this figure has mostly been achieved,that the Centre will now hold,is another reason why Verdict 2009 deserves applause.",Hands down | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/hands-down/
993,"No first-use†options. Summary. Shortly after conducting the Pokharan II tests,the NDA government made two significant announcements. One was a voluntary moratorium on further nuclear testing,and the other an unequivocal commitment to no-first-use of nuclear weapons. It is the second that is becoming increasingly relevant as the post-November 26 strategic picture develops. A nuclear weapons power makes a no-first-use commitment only because it is so sure of its conventional deterrence that it believes it won<U+0092>t need the nukes except in retaliation. India<U+0092>s larger strategic thinking is,therefore,predicated on two beliefs: that our conventional strength is sufficient to ward off any future,conventional threat from China,and is adequate to deter Pakistan with a threat of punishment. To that extent,nuclear weapons become the weaker,or the losing side<U+0092>s,option in the subcontinent. India<U+0092>s deterrent,therefore,remains a decisive conventional superiority. Unless you have it,you cannot talk of no-first-use. Over the past five years,we have allowed the gap between our conventional strength and Pakistan<U+0092>s to narrow so dangerously that that deterrent has weakened. That is why Pakistan was bold enough to create war hysteria pro-actively after November 26. The establishment there believes India no longer has the capability of imposing quick and effective retribution and,if a spiral of retaliation escalates,it would be at most a war of attrition,and soon enough the global community would stop it. Or they could raise the nuclear alarm. You can read this cockiness in every post-November 26 move and statement of the Pakistani establishment. Their response was substantively different from what it was even in 2001-<U+0092>02 after the Parliament attack. There are clear conclusions to be drawn from it. One,the Pakistanis believe there is far too much Western strategic capital invested with them for the US and allies to <U+0093>allow<U+0094> India to retaliate. But second,and more important,that the gap between India<U+0092>s conventional forces and theirs is no longer what it used to be. So any Indian talk of retaliation is just talk. That India only threatens retaliation to catch the attention of the world,and that is a game they can play more brazenly,and gainfully. It is most likely that if the Pakistanis pushed this belief too far they may live to regret it,because India is now sitting precariously on its patience threshold,beyond which such calculations will not matter. But their basic assessment is sound. India,over the past five years,has frittered away the military advantage created in the preceding five. And the history of our troubled relationship with Pakistan shows that any time our political leadership lapses into such complacence,the generals on the other side get adventurous. Their move into Kargil in 1999 was also mostly based on a similar belief. India,post-1989,had been ignoring its armed forces. Kargil laid bare India<U+0092>s inadequacies that were underlined,so tellingly,by that one statement from the then army chief,General V.P. Malik: <U+0093>We will fight with whatever we have got.<U+0094> He spoke from pent-up frustration at our system<U+0092>s inability to procure or produce what the armed forces needed. And he wasn<U+0092>t wrong. The forces had not inducted a significant new system then for more than a decade. He brilliantly used massed Bofors artillery to back his infantry<U+0092>s assaults against dug-in intruders on the heights,but it involved such a large percentage of his long-range guns that if the war had escalated he would have felt the pinch across the battlefront. The shock of Kargil did make our establishment act. The next couple of years saw some quick spending and acquisitions <U+0097> so strong was the sense of urgency that even the Tehelka interruption did not slow that momentum. Some new weapon systems and force multipliers did get inducted,and the basic gear and equipment of the average jawan improved. But that phase was short-lived. The Congress<U+0092>s return to power brought back the Bofors blood feud. The Congress now wanted evidence to pay George Fernandes (and the BJP) back for what they had done to it on Bofors,and the NDA was not willing to bury the hatchet either. Quattrocchi returned to the headlines at that crucial moment as well. One significant fallout was that the defence establishment now became entirely scared of closing any acquisition deals. In any case,most deals initiated by the NDA were under investigation now,so who was going to push for them? And,similarly,who wanted to risk exploring new ones,just in case the government changed again in these times of anti-incumbency? Waffling over the upgrade and strengthening of high-calibre artillery is a very good example of this politicisation of military acquisitions. Of the three guns that qualified for trials,one is Bofors by another name (BAE-SWS),so who would touch it? The second is from South Africa<U+0092>s Denel which was black-listed post-Tehelka,and the third,of exotic Singaporean ancestry,is not convincing enough. As a result,our artillery strength is pretty much at a level that was attained in 1989 and considered grossly inadequate by 1999. You can write an entire book listing such disasters. But the larger picture cannot be missed,by our strategic establishment or that across the border. In areas that give a country decisive conventional superiority <U+0097> long-range artillery,armour,multi-role aircraft,even submarines <U+0097> we have allowed our strength to get run down to levels where we have lost our conventional deterrence. And this,as charts accompanying this article show,is borne out by hard figures. In every budget the finance minister draws warm applause when he states that should defence need more money,he will be willing to provide it. The fact,however,is that year after year our defence forces do not manage to spend a large amount of the money allocated to them even in the original budget <U+0097> and so their revised estimates are always lower. And even out of that,they return a dangerously large part of the money provided for new acquisitions unspent. It is also no surprise then that money provided for acquisition,as a percentage of the capital budget,has been declining over the years. As is our own defence spending,as a percentage of GDP. This is not the way an aspiring global power hopes to survive in such a hostile neighbourhood and preserve the security of its people and their self-respect. And certainly,this is not the way to back a nuclear doctrine that promises no-first-use. Because this allows the nukes to become just one side<U+0092>s deterrence,and underwrites its adventurist defiance. After the welcome new focus on internal security,therefore,the government would need to look at military preparedness with the same sense of alarm. Squeezing the sword arm. Every year we budget less for our defence; then we revise that downwards. Even of that,more and more is returned unspent. And this when in two decades our defence spending has more than halved as a percentage of GDP. This is no way for an aspiring global power to manage its defence,particularly when it lives in such a hostile environment and follows a no-first-use nuclear doctrine.",No first-use options | The Indian Express,1/16/14,http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/no-firstuse-options/

Definition: A product is the item offered for sale. A product can be a service or an item. It can be physical or in virtual or cyber form. Every product is made at a cost and each is sold at a price. The price that can be charged depends on the market, the quality, the marketing and the segment that is targeted. Each product has a useful life after which it needs replacement, and a life cycle after which it has to be re-invented. In FMCG parlance, a brand can be revamped, re-launched or extended to make it more relevant to the segment and times, often keeping the product almost the same. Description: A product needs to be relevant: the users must have an immediate use for it. A product needs to be functionally able to do what it is supposed to, and do it with a good quality. A product needs to be communicated: Users and potential users must know why they need to use it, what benefits they can derive from it, and what it does difference it does to their lives. Advertising and 'brand building' best do this. A product needs a name: a name that people remember and relate to. A product with a name becomes a brand. It helps it stand out from the clutter of products and names. A product should be adaptable: with trends, time and change in segments, the product should lend itself to adaptation to make it more relevant and maintain its revenue stream.",Product Definition | Product Meaning - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/product
995,"NEW DELHI: Government has asked the European Airbus Defence company to extend the validity of its tender bid for supplying six mid-air refuelling aircraft -- expected to be worth over Rs 6,000 crore -- up to July 31 in the next fiscal. The development comes at a time when the Defence Ministry has almost exhausted its modernisation funds for this fiscal and is understood to have postponed till 2014-15 the finalisation of many key deals such as the procurement of attack and heavy-lift helicopters. Defence ministry asked us to extend the validity of our bid up to July 31, 2014, for supplying six Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft and we have agreed to that, Airbus Defence officials said here. IAF last year selected Airbus to fulfill its requirement for six mid-air refuelling aircraft and is in negotiations with the European firm for finalising the contract, which is expected to be worth over Rs 6,000 crore. The firm was chosen by IAF after it emerged as the lowest bidder in terms of life-cycle costs against its Russian rival, the Ilyushin-78 tanker aircraft. IAF has plans of deploying the aircraft at Panagarh in West Bengal, which is also the site for the setting up of the headquarters of Army's new Mountain Strike Corps , coming up along the China border. Asked to comment on the Government of India's cancellation of the deal with AgustaWestland for 12 VVIP choppers, Airbus Defence official Peter Gutsmiedl said his group's top priority was compliance with ethics and India's sensitivity towards such issues.","Airbus extends tender validity in Rs 6,000cr aircraft deal - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/airbus-extends-tender-validity-in-rs-6000cr-aircraft-deal/articleshow/28889856.cms
996,"NEW DELHI: A day after the gangrape of a Danish woman here, Delhi government today accused the Delhi Police of being ""highly compromised"" and failing to ensure the safety of people of the national capital. ""Delhi police are highly compromised. If accountability of Delhi Police is not fixed, then crime and rape incidents will not go down,"" Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters here and warned the Delhi Police Commissioner that his government and people of Delhi will not remain mute spectators in case police functioning does not improve. ""After a rape takes place , then we demand immediate arrest of the culprits. But that is not sufficient. Why would rapes happen in the first place""? Kejriwal said. Citing two specific instances of ""non-cooperation"" by the police in which two Delhi government ministers sought action, the Chief Minister said his government sought an immediate suspension of two SHOs and two ACPs allegedly involved. ""We demand as well as give ultimatum to Delhi Police to suspend the erring SHOs of Sagarpur and Malviya Nagar police station. Sagarpur police did not take action against the family who burnt their daughter-in-law even after Women and Child Development Minister Rakhi Birla while Malviya Nagar police plainly refused to take action in the alleged sex and drug trafficking racket being run from Khirki village despite the Law Minister's tip-off,"" Kejriwal said told a press conference here. He also demanded the suspension of the two ACPs who had come to the spot and allegedly did not act. Reacting to Delhi Police's statements about the minsiters interfering in their work, Kejriwal said ""how can Delhi Police say that state ministers are interfering in their work? Police are just refusing to act."" Kejriwal's reaction was in response to letters written to him by Bharti and Rakhi Birla, both of whom faced severe resistance from the police on Wednesday night, when they brought two separate incidents to the notice of concerned police officials at two different places. Kejriwal said he will meet the Lt Governor and raise the issue with him. ""I am meeting Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung tomorrow morning, where Delhi Police commissioner is also coming. I am going to tell him in strong words that citizens of Delhi will not be a mute spectator,"" said Kejriwal.","Delhi Police ""highly compromised"": Arvind Kejriwal - The Economic Times",1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/and/nation/Delhi-Police-highly-compromised-Arvind-Kejriwal/articleshow/28898944.cms
997,"ET Policy on Columnists. Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd's publications have a long and storied history of enabling some of India's most distinguished minds to define, interpret, satirize and lend meaning to policy, politics, business and the many questions that life in general engender. Studies have consistently shown how well read and regarded the columns in our publications are. Each publication in our stable is well known for its columnists, whose opinions are cherished, criticized and, we daresay, treasured by many. Selecting columnists is a carefully considered process at The Times Group, and much emphasis is placed on the potential columnist's ability to deftly present complex thoughts in a modern, engaging manner. We also look to carry a varied and eclectic mix of writers with relevant specializations. In line with our overall philosophy of anekantvad, The Group believes in pluralism and a multiplicity of perspectives, and sets great store by the ability of our publications to reflect competing worldviews. The Group also believes in the supremacy of the individual, and his or her need for knowledge that empowers, as opposed to mere information. The primary criterion for selecting a columnist for the Economic Times is that he must primarily be a writer and his writing must take precedence over his other work. The writer should ideally have cut his teeth elsewhere before being considered for publication in ET. Having said this, we do not choose a columnist simply because he is 'a name'. We are not impressed by a columnist being, for example, a politician or an industrialist, however influential or powerful he might be. Unless the politician or industrialist has something new to say, or adds significantly to the discourse and reasons in a most compelling manner, ET will not invite him for anything more than the occasional one-off piece. Sometimes, an individual from a profession other than writing may occasionally morph into a writer worthy of regular column space but then, he should have perfected his writing elsewhere. Hence, guest columnists are selected primarily for their writing style and their ability to produce fresh, compelling pieces that draw in a mass audience even as they resonate with the expert. While these columns may sometimes help set the agenda, they are primarily meant to be the columnist's unique take on the world - there are no illusions about changing the world. At ET, the central dharma is that the writer serves the reader and not himself or his other interests. His column must be a beacon for the reader, not a prop or crutch or lever to further the columnist's own agenda. This means that columnists cannot write about their companies or about themselves in a manner that promotes their personal or commercial profile. So, while a business or corporate columnist may write about his travails in small-town India, he cannot be allowed to 'plug' his employer or himself, as a professional, in the article. Similarly, a more literary columnist cannot write about his book or comment on another author's in his column unless it is absolutely integral to the subject at hand. We would like to stress the above, because we understand that depending on how mass media vehicles are managed, they have the power to build or destroy reputations within short, finite time spans. Our publications have no such agenda. While we report and opine on people and events, it is always designed to be free of any intention to either boost their endeavours, careers and interests, or to run them down in any way. In sum, the end result of a columnist's efforts must be a gem of a piece, chiseled to perfection, with multiple facets, great clarity, and no discernible flaws. This polish, and this perfection, may not always be possible without the active involvement of the editor, with whom the columnist has a trustful compact. It is the editor's prerogative to edit any column that appears in his publication; if the columnist refuses to be edited, it is the editor's right not to publish the column. This refusal, we must stress, may well be necessary. Of course, once in a while, out of this compact, something truly unusual happens ... and there emerges a formless, shapeless entity that cannot be labelled or bottled up. Whereby the columnist shrugs off his own identity, empties his mind and, like that proverbial diamond polished to perfection, is able to become so 'colourless' that he is able to let light pass through whatever he writes, dispersing it as the colours of the rainbow for the reader to catch as he or she may. As has been said, all fixed patterns are incapable of adaptability, and the truth is outside of all fixed patterns. It is with that worldview and no fixed coordinates that we invite the reader on a journey committed to publishing excellence.",ET Policy on Columnists - The Economic Times,1/16/14,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-company/corporate-announcement/et-policy-on-columnists/articleshow/22513744.cms
